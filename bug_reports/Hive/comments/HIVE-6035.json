[The root cause of this problem is that the -Dlog4j.configuration needs to be in the format of "file://d:/xxx", so:
"file://" + log4jProps.getAbsolutePath()
works on Linux but does not work on Windows.

This patch fixed two problem:
 1) templeton.cmd correctly set WEBHCAT_CONF_DIR so that override_container_log4j.properties can be copied to distributed cache. I also modified it so that one can run timepleton.cmd (without any parameter) in standalone mode.
 2) use hadoop class Path to convert the override log4j properties file path.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12623767, I'm going to cancel this patch, upload a new version of the same patch (so it applies cleanly on trunk) and re-mark it as patch available. If precommit tests do not have a problem, I'll go ahead and commit., Attached new patch. Also, please note that I have removed the fix version for this patch, since fix version is supposed to be set only after a commit has been made, and tracks what version the patch has been applied to, not which version the commit is desired in.,
