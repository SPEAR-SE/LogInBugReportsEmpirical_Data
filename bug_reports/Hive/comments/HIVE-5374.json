[I've attached a patch for this issue., cc: [~prasadm], [~k.saruta] Thanks for catching the problem. Looks fine to me.
The column name from COMMENT to VERSION_COMMENT is fixed as part of HIVE-5301, though its missing the "s for Postgres. You might need to rebase the patch on the latest trunk. Other than that, looks fine to me.

+1 (non-binding), [~k.saruta] If you want me to take care of the rebase/review etc, please feel free to assign the ticket to me. Thanks!, [~prasadm] sorry, I've already created a rebased patch before seeing your latest post. So, could you review that?, Looks fine me. Thanks for the fix!

, We still want VER_ID to be primary key, right? your patch seems to have removed it., [~ashutoshc] It's getting created at towards the end of the script via 'alter table' its not needed in the create., [~ashutoshc] Yes, we still want VER_ID to be primary key. I removed primary key constraint from table definition because VER_ID is to be primary key by ALTER in the sql scripts., Sorry.. missed that. +1 
[~k.saruta] you need to reupload ur patch file named as HIVE-5374.1.patch for automated QA to pick up the patch., Sorry, I submitted a wrong named patch. I've submitted a new patch.,
