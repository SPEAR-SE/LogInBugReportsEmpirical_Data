[NOTE: Vectorized operator pipeline does not support complex types yet. Although reader supports reading out complex vectors the Vectorizer will fail to vectorize. We use the same test cases from vectorization in MiniLlap, when vectorization supports complex types the encoded data reader should work fine., [~sershe] Can you please take a look?, Dup of HIVE-13744 :P I'll take a look eventually, Sorry for the oversight :) I will close this one.. Will use the old one instead., Duplicate of HIVE-13744., heh... it's better to close the old one, since this one already had the patch... I was just being nitpicky]
