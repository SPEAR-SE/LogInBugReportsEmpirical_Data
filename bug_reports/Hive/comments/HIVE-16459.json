ATTACHMENT ID: 12863619 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Failures not related. [~xuefuz] could you take a look? Thanks., Just noticed we're already cancelling RPCs in {{RpcDispatcher::channelInactive}}. However, we have a "monitor" inbound handler that doesn't forward channelInactive event. Therefore {{RpcDispatcher::channelInactive}} is not triggered. Patch v2 fixes this monitor.,
