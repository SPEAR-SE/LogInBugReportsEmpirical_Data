[use this file to start hive on cygwin

bin/start.sh, Initially it works with bin/start.sh but after closing cygwin it is not working.
It is not showing any kind of output.
And one more problem is with select query , that it is giving Execution error on Cygwin.
Pls help me., Running Hive on Cygwin is not a supported configuration. In the past some people have gotten this to work by tweaking different parts of the code, but we don't test Hive on Cygwin, and consequently have no way of insuring that this configuration works. Please run Hive on Linux instead.]
