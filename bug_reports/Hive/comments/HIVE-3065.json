[I haven't tested with 0.9.x yet, but suspect it's a problem there as well., This problem still exists in 0.10.0. I'm using RCFile and ran into this issue today. Not sure about 0.11.0 as I'm limited to the packages available in the CDH distribution., I believe the issue is that Hive encodes the data as delimited text inside the file format., This is a duplicate of HIVE-1608. There is a very easy work around for this bug, setting "hive.query.result.fileformat" to "SequenceFile".]
