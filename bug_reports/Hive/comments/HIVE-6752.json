Thanks for the response on review board. I agree that it is reasonable to take up the issues raised in separate JIRAs, which are not time-critical at this point., Thanks for the review Eric, I have filed following jiras:
HIVE-6776 : To optimize timestamp comparisons.
HIVE-6777: Comments and readability in VectorizedHashKeyWrapper., [~rhbutani] This bug affects hive-0.13 and is important for decimal/date to work correctly in vectorization, therefore the patch should be ported to branch-0.13 as well., I ran the tests locally for the latest patch, and tests pass., +1 for 0.13,
