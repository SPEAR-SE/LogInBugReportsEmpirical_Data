[A couple of thoughts to resolve this:

1) Change the namespace of the included (json, commons-lang, etc...) classes that are used by Hive
2) Create 2 versions of Hive-Exec (One with embedded projects, one that relies on external jars)

Why are these projects embedded? Is it to reduce the number of dependencies the JDBC driver requires?]
