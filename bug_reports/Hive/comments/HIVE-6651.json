[The link is broken in four docs:  GET queue/:jobid, DELETE queue/:jobid, GET jobs/:jobid, and DELETE jobs/:jobid.

The link tries to go to the "stable" version of Hadoop API docs -- http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobProfile.html -- but there are two stable sets of docs, stable1 for Hadoop 1 and stable2 for Hadoop 2, with "stable" currently set to stable2.  Class JobProfile is not in stable2, but it is in stable1:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable1/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobProfile.html].

It's easy enough to change all the links to stable1 (and for consistency also change the JobStatus links) but does the Hadoop 2 vs. Hadoop 1 distinction matter in the WebHCat documentation?

Hadoop doc sets are here:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/].  Stable, stable1, and stable2 are listed at the bottom.

* stable (Hadoop 2.2.0) API docs:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/api/index.html]
* stable1 (Hadoop 1.2.1) API docs:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable1/api/index.html]
* stable2 (Hadoop 2.2.0) API docs:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable2/api/index.html]

WebHCat docs with broken links:

* [Get Queue JobID |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+JobInfo#WebHCatReferenceJobInfo-Results]
* [Delete Queue JobID |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+DeleteJob#WebHCatReferenceDeleteJob-Results]
* [Get Jobs JobID |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+Job#WebHCatReferenceJob-Results]
* [Delete Jobs JobID |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+DeleteJobID#WebHCatReferenceDeleteJobID-Results]
, 1. WebHCat just passes along to the user whatever information it finds in JobProfile object.
2. In H2, JobProfile was annotated with InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate({"MapReduce"}) and InterfaceStability.Unstable.  In H1 it's not annotated with anything.
3. JobStatus is a public (via annotations) class so we can assume that it will be stable.


So I think we should remove the link for JobProfile and just put org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobProfile class name there with a note that WebHCat just passes along the info in this object which is subject to change from one Hadoop version to another.
, Done, please review so we can resolve this jira:

* [Get Queue JobID | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+JobInfo#WebHCatReferenceJobInfo-Results]
* [Delete Queue JobID | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+DeleteJob#WebHCatReferenceDeleteJob-Results]
* [Get Jobs JobID | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+Job#WebHCatReferenceJob-Results]
* [Delete Jobs JobID | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+DeleteJobID#WebHCatReferenceDeleteJobID-Results], +1, Fixed in the wiki.  Thanks, Eugene!]
