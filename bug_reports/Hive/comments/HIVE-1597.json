[I just tried it with hbase trunk (which gives a ZooKeeperConnectionException instead of the MasterNotRunningException as we reworked that part). Looking at the hive.log file, I see that it tries to connect to a non-default port:

{noformat}
2010-10-21 11:49:21,871 DEBUG zookeeper.ZKUtil (ZKUtil.java:connect(94)) - hconnection opening connection to ZooKeeper with ensemble (localhost:21818)
{noformat}

This is because there's a hbase-site.xml file in hbase's src/test/resources that's used for tests which has the port 21818 and it seems to get picked up on the classpath. If I set hbase.zookeeper.client.port to 2181 in conf/hive-site.xml, I can create the table just fine. I believe this is a HBase issue, not Hive, and I'll make sure we fix this for 0.90.0. since I can easily see "normal" users getting this error., Oh I see now, the hbase-site.xml for the unit tests wasn't included in the test jar before and now it seems it is., I created HBASE-3143., In our case the problem appeared to be related to Hive HBase handler being compiled with outdated jars.  The solution (for HBase 0.89.20100830) was to make sure $HIVE_SOURCE/lib contains both hbase-0.89.20100830.jar and hbase-0.89.20100830-tests.jar and no other versions of hbase jars.
, This looks to be a classpath/external problem. Reopen if we missed something.]
