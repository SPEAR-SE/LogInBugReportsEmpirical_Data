[I also ran into this issue and another similar but probably unrelated issue. In particular, I noticed that the following script works fine:

{code:sql}
select * from dummy limit 1;
{code}

but the following version of the script generates the same error as dan f reported (i.e. FAILED: Parse Error: line 0:-1 cannot recognize input '<EOF>'):

{code:sql}
select * from dummy limit 1;
â€“ unsafe end of script comment
{code}

An error caused by a comment at the end of a script is probably less severe than the original error reported by dan f since it does not actually affect the "select * ..." statement which precedes it.  That being said, it would still be nice if the second script ran without any errors.

In general, I would guess that both errors represent a fairly common class of errors which are especially likely to occur if people comment out sections of their script., I have a fix for this as part of HIVE-1953, patch currently waiting for review. I have tested the fix for both reported error cases and it seems to fix the reported errors., HIVE-1953]
