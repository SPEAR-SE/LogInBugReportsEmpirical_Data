[Paul, possible to share more details like configs, heapdump? If you add the following line to your hive-env, it will automatically generate a headpdump for you when the process goes OOM: 
{code}
export HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS="$HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS -XX:+HeapDumpOnOutOfMemoryError -XX:HeapDumpPath=<your_custom_path>"
{code}, Ok, will do.  Thanks, Also, can you please explain why these files are being created every 30 minutes (from the hiveserver2.log)?
Created local directory: /tmp/hive/8e2ce5bf-c3f7-43c0-9da0-3153fbf4a79a
Created HDFS directory: /tmp/hive/anonymous/dc28d7db-41dd-49d3-8e76-c29cd2e7bf2f/_tmp_space.db, Attached config files. Will share heap dump file after it is generated., I am seeing a very similar error on HDP2.2.0 on RedHat6
I can perhaps help with diagnostics if Paul has gone quiet. , [~alexmc] That would be great. Let me know if you need any help from me in that.]
