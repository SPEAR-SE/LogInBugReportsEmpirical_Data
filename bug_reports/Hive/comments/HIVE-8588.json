[[~thejas] https://reviews.apache.org/r/27131/, [~vikram.dixit] w/o this change, for users to submit Sqoop jobs via WebHCat requires them to modify the Sqoop tar file to include the additional JDBC jars in it which is a major usability issue especially when working with multiple DBs and upgrades., I meant to say in my previous comment that it would be good to get this into 0.14., +1 for 0.14, +1, Patch committed to trunk and 0.14.  Thanks [~thejas] for the review., Doc note:  This adds WebHCat configuration parameters *templeton.sqoop.archive* and *templeton.sqoop.home*, and changes the default value of *templeton.sqoop.path* (which isn't documented in the wiki yet -- see HIVE-6940 and comments on HIVE-4725).

They need to be documented here:

* [WebHCat Configuration -- Configuration Variables | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Configure#WebHCatConfigure-ConfigurationVariables]

Will that be sufficient, or should there be a new section providing guidance and examples?, Sqoop end point should have it's own section like https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+Pig for example, Of course, and HIVE-6940 has all the information -- d'oh.
Thanks, [~eugene.koifman]. , This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
