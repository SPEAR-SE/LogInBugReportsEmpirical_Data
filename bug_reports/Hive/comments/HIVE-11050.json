[lgtm +1 if tests pass. Can you comment on how you made sure that the updated results are actually correct? (I've only glanced at them)., In each of 4 Q files I turned off vectorization and compared those results to runs with vectorization.

Ran on test machine that has the environment that triggered the problem and now the same results are produced.  The wrong statistics turned out to be a symptom of the wrong input data being created.,

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12740528 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to branch-1.2 and master., [~mmccline] Patch does not apply cleanly in branch-1. Reopening the issue., I could not apply the patch to branch-1 either.  I recreated the changes using a difftool and attached that patch as HIVE-11050.01.branch-1.patch

I tried to commit but don't have permissions for that branch?

[~ prasanthj] Can you try committing the alternate patch?  Thanks.
, Committed to branch-1 as well. Thanks [~mmccline]!
