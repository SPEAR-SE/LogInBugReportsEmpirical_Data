[During that patch the HiveResultset was split into a HiveQueryResultSet and a HiveMetaDataResultSet with a super class called HiveBaseResultSet. Using the HiveQueryResultSet should give you the same functionality as the old HiveResultSet., Thanks for the quick response.  I'll compare our changes of HiveResultSet with revision 980611 and see if changes will be necessary to the new classes:  HiveQueryResultSet,  HiveBaseResultSet, HiveBaseResultSet.

, Hmmm, this should have been an svn remove (rather than empty file).  I'll do another commit to fix that.]
