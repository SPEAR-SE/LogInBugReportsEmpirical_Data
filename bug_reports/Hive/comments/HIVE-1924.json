[Not sure how to test this automatically, since the readers are transient. The way I actually tested is by
 - running on a nfs mounted directory (since nfs creates .nfsxxxxxx files for open files which have been deleted)
 - pausing the code after a load command (with conf hive. is executed
 - using lsof to list open files by the process, Tested only manually with hive.fileformat.check set to true, Hmm, The patch is not correct. Setting hive.checkformat=false does seem to stop the leaks though. Investigating..., Problem referenced in HADOOP-5476 and HIVE-1185]
