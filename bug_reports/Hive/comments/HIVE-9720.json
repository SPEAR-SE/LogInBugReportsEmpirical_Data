ATTACHMENT ID: 12704178 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ashutoshc], Committed to trunk. Thanks, Chaoyu., Thanks Xuefu for reviewing and committing the patch., Hi Chaoyu,

i m facing the issue in hive.can u suggest on this plz

hive> show roles;
FAILED: SemanticException The current builtin authorization in Hive is incomplete and disabled.
Error from Hive: error code: '0' error message: 'ExecuteStatement finished with operation state: CLOSED_STATE'
, [~ankush13] Personally I do not think the issue you are running into is related to this JIRA, otherwise, please let me know. I noticed that you had filed HIVE-9667 (ExecuteStatement finished with operation state: CLOSED_STATE). Thanks, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., [~ctang.ma] and [~xuefuz], sorry to trouble you guys. [~ashutoshc] and I recently met a similar problem and we tracked it here. Basically, we have a partitioned table and then it is renamed. The column stats of the partitions are all gone because of the renaming. Lines 223-224 of HiveAlterHandler.java did this. This is good because it at least prevents the bug from happening. We are wondering, when you guys did this patch, did you consider the option to update the columns stats for the partitions (change the table name) rather than deleting them? It seems a better option? Thanks!, [~pxiong] As I remember I once tried to update instead of delete the stats in rename but it failed because of the DN. It seems that the stats could only be updated after the rename (table or partition) has been successfully committed, which means the stats update has to be in a different transaction. I will double check that and see if there is any better implementation to see whether it is the case., [~ctang.ma], thanks a lot for your reply. As you are the most experienced one on this, we are looking forward to seeing if there is any better options. And by the way, I submit a patch for branch-1.0 for maintenance purpose.]
