[4305 might change things over to mvn., Attaching a WIP patch that moves all third-party dependencies (i.e. non inter module deps) to the root ivy.xml file.

@Gunther: If you'd like to push this forward I'm happy to review and commit it. Thanks., Updated version of the patch that fixes offline mode. I verified that 'ant clean package -Doffline=true' works with the network cable pulled out. The downside is that I had to disable the HCatalog build since they're still doing their own thing., Thanks [~cwsteinbach]. Just saw this. I'll take a look tonight. Feel free to take over the jira, if it seems I am becoming the bottleneck on this., [~cwsteinbach] I've split the patch and moved the offline mode stuff to HIVE-4382. Seems the two things are unrelated. The part about third-party dependencies looks good, still need to do more testing on it though., .4 rebased against trunk. did some testing and that was fine., Not required after mavenization.]
