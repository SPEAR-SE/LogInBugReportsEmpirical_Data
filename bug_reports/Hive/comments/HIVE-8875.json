ATTACHMENT ID: 12683677 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, No user doc needed?, Already added.  Search on hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DML, Doc question:  The DML wiki says "In version 0.14 it is recommended that you set hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition=false when doing updates | deletes" -- does that mean 0.14 and later, or 0.14 only (if this jira makes it unnecessary in 0.15)?]
