[The proposed solution introduces a concurrency bug since
reservedPartitionValues is a class variable and access to
it is not synchronized. It looks like another solution which
doesn't introduce concurrency issues is to make
make reservedPartitionValues a private instance variable., @Ning: can you also make TokenToTypeName private? I can't see any reason why this should be public. Thanks!, Good catch Carl. Yeah, it won't work for HiveServer.

I'm uploading a new patch taking your 2 comments., updated to current trunk.,
