  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2702

  Added support for integer partitions in listPartitionByFilter method

  listPartitionsByFilter supports only non-string partitions. This is because its explicitly specified in generateJDOFilterOverPartitions in ExpressionTree.java.

  //Can only support partitions whose types are string
        if( ! table.getPartitionKeys().get(partitionColumnIndex).
            getType().equals(org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde.Constants.STRING_TYPE_NAME) ) {
          throw new MetaException
          ("Filtering is supported only on partition keys of type string");
        }

Tip: use the X-Herald-Rules header to filter Herald messages in your client.
, @Aniket,
This is by design. Partition values are stored as strings in backend db (mysql) so pushing filters into db where partition column is of numeric types won't work, since then comparison will happen lexicographically. You should be able to catch this with rigorous tests. e.g., with your patch on, create table with partition key of int type, add partitions 1-11 and then do filter p < 2 and you will get partitions 1,10,11 instead of 1. Though, you can still push equality predicate. 
Enabling this feature requires mysql table schema updates which can retain type information for partition keys.   , I agree on your comment, I didn't catch it earlier. I wonder if there is an elegant workaround for this. , This is very limiting for HCat as it means HCat clients cannot access non-string partitions from Pig or MR, whereas they are available via Hive directly.  The JDOQL that's used in generateJDOFilter() to generate the query is not powerful enough to support stripping out the value, casting it to a number, and then sorting it thusly.  The best solution is probably to re-write ObjectStore.listPartitionNamesByFilter() to not use the Partitions table (which stores the values as "PARTITION=FOO" but rather take advantage of PARTITION_KEY_VALS, which stores the partition values by themselves.  Any objections to this approach?, Drop partition get org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.SemanticException because of this design.
Drop partition is a base function,why this design exist if a base function can not work!, There hasn't been activity for a while, I will take over if you don't mind, Preliminary patch. No tests so far, in case something is wrong in the approach, this is my first hive patch.
Existing tests pass.

Patch summary: for filter pushdown,

* add support for equals for integral partition types;
* add support for not-equals for both;
* allow the client to push down other compare ops for string partitions - server already supports that;
* change Filter.g integral type handling to use Long instead of Integer, to support bigger numbers;
* refactor generateJDOFilterOverPartitions a bit.

Adding other compare operators for integral types is next. I added a TODO in the patch where it should be done. The approach will need to be considered more carefully and may involve some refactoring., sershe requested code review of "HIVE-2702 [jira] listPartitionsByFilter only supports string partitions".

Reviewers: JIRA

initial changes and tests, this time posting to Phabricator; compared to previous patch in the JIRA, added testing, as well as support for negative numbers.
I will run some perf tests, locally on derby it seems to work well.

, gt/lt/etc. hit HIVE-2609 unfortunately; I simplified valString to avoid nested substrings but that didn't help either, and Collection get method is not supported on DN 2.0. 
Making blocked on DN upgrade, Well, this is also blocked (kind of) by the hack where during query parsing we set the types of all partitioning columns to string. This causes the constant type to be changed to double thru a complex chain of events, unless it's explicitly set to bigint.
This causes the validation to fail and filter to not be pushed down.
I am not sure why HIVE-3059 reverted it, there are no details...
 , Actually, as a quick workaround I can change the part of HIVE-2249 that changes the legitimately derived integer type to double if the other column is string. I don't think it makes sense... I feel like an archeologist by now, sershe updated the revision "HIVE-2702 [jira] listPartitionsByFilter only supports string partitions".

  Some minor fixes to the patch, remove client support for most compare ops since it cannot easily be supported due to DN bugs/missing features in 2.0, fix the number type scrambling that was causing pushdown to not work for integers.

, ran some perf tests, filter pushdown can cut about 300ms for getting partitions on 16k-partition table on my machine, with standalone metastore on the same machine (for equivalent queries e.g. n=0 vs "n=0 and n>=0"), ashutoshc has requested changes to the revision "HIVE-2702 [jira] listPartitionsByFilter only supports string partitions".

  Some comments.

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:161 Its better to say numeric type here, since we can also support byte and short (both of which are valid hive types) as well.
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:262 As stated earlier, lets rename this method and variable as doesOpSupportNumeric()
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:272 Why are you checking value instanceof Long here ? This parsing is not done via grammar described in Filter.g
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/parser/ExpressionTree.java:299 I presume this depends on DN upgrade, lets postpone it till than.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:7699 HIVE-3059, I assume you want to say.

Rebase on top of HIVE-4929. It should still compile/pass server tests, but won't work properly before HIVE-4929
