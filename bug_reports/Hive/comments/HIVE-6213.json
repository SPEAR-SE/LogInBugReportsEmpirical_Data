[first,we should copy hadoop-mapreduce-client-core-2.0.0-cdh4.2.1.jar which exists in "hadoop-2.0.0-cdh4.2.1\share\hadoop\mapreduce " into  "hadoop-2.0.0-mr1-cdh4.2.1\lib" ;then,it will throw exception when we execute hql which calls mapreduce., Hi,

Thank you for the report!!  Getting Hive 0.11 to work on CDH4 would be a CDH issue should be reported here: http://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO. 

However, as I work at Cloudera I can report that:

1) CDH4 will only support Hive 0.10
2) CDH5b1 shipped with Hive 0.11
3) CDH5b2 will ship with Hive 0.12
