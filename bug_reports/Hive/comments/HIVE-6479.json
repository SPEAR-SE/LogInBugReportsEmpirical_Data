[Another failed build https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-6375?focusedCommentId=13907770&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13907770, Straightfwd patch. Better to commit asap, so not to generate false alarm for future builds., +1 . I don't think we need to wait for the full unit test suite to kick in or for 24hours for this one, as it just updates 2 .q files. I will commit it after verifying that these two tests pass with this change.
, Verified that the 2 tests pass with this .q.out file update . I am planning to commit this in another 1/2 hour. It will get rid of false alarms for the pending precommit tests.
, Patch committed to trunk.
Thanks for the patch Ashutosh!
