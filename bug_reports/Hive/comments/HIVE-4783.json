[[~appodictic] I was wondering if you might take a look at this one? I am reaching out since it's a security problem with our website..., Committed. Thanks, Brock!, Just a note for posterity sake, the reason I created a JIRA for this is because the notification to the committers list included this statement "The issue is public and may be discussed freely on your project's dev list." A copy of the email can be seen on LUCENE-5072. In almost every scenario security bugs should be sent to security@hive.apache.org.]
