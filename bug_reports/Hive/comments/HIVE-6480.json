ATTACHMENT ID: 12630362, +1, Looks good to me, will commit., Committed. Thanks for the contribution, Adam!, Does this need any user doc?, Shouldn't need any userdoc, this simply changes the semantic to a "set if not already set" mode rather than a blind set. Most people will not even run this script, since the bigtop installations of hive won't use this script to start the metastore - this is a leftover script from the days hcat was a separate project - it's use now is primarily so devs can use for testing the metastore without too much setup., Good to know.  Thanks, [~sushanth]., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
