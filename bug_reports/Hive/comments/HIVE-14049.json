[Can you give some details to reproduce the error?

On my mac it works as expected:

Beeline version 2.2.0-SNAPSHOT by Apache Hive
beeline> !connect jdbc:hive2://
Connecting to jdbc:hive2://
Enter username for jdbc:hive2://: hive
Enter password for jdbc:hive2://: ****

The second readLine call is responsible for the password input. It replaces the output to the console to * as you see.
, If you still have this issue, please feel free to reopen this., Closing this as not reproducible based on the comments above. Also, haven't seen this issue in a while.]
