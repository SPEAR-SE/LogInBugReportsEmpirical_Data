[Based on http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/Hive/HiveQL/Types#Implicit_and_Explicit_Type_Conversions this appears to actually be a bug rather than an improvement., Also present in CASE statements:

FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: line 37:57 Argument Type Mismatch '$.foo': The expressions after THEN should have the same type: "int" is expected but "string" is found
, Fixed as part of JIRA HIVE-872]
