This message is automatically generated., +1 for the patch, but I cannot reply any of questions. [~ashutoshc] Could you check this?, As I mentioned in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3805?focusedCommentId=13533106&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13533106 this TUGIContainingTransport is really a hack, current way to do this is to use {{Plain Sasl Server}} otherwise we keep running into problems like this. [~agateaaa] wondering if you would like to pursue the 'proper fix'? 
If not, than I need to think a bit for this current patch. Will get back to you soon. , ~ashutoshc, We have a patched version currently running in our test environment and havent run into any other problems for more than two weeks. I agree having a elegant solution is probably warranted but probably should be done in a different JIRA (just my opinion). This problem was a showstopper P1 issue for us and had to spend weeks to track it down.

, Though fix seems harmless, I think it doesn't eliminate root cause. Under intense GC pressure, same problem may occur even with this fix. I am fine putting this in, but just be aware this fix has not solved the root cause., Thanks [~ashutoshc] and [~navis] for taking the time to look at this patch. Can we put this patch in ? Having this patch in will be helpful for lot of users as its better than the way it is right now (which is not usable at all for production use under any circumstance)
