[Changed pom to include map reduce libraries needed in unit tests., Tested to see if this fixes hcatalog-pig-adapter issues with -Phadoop-2, and it does.

+1, HIVE-6514 duplicates this, and also does a bit more (adds it as a dep for ql/pom.xml) I figure it's better to get that in in one shot?, Closing as duplicate of HIVE-6514, tracking there.]
