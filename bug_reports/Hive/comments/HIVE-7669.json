ATTACHMENT ID: 12664550, [~navis] sorry i already approved it, but just saw that the test is missing a license header.  Also I left another comment on the RB that I just thought of.

Also +[~leftylev] for any other comment about the configuration., Thanks for asking, [~szehon].  I had already glanced at the parameter descriptions and thought they were okay, but closer inspection produced an improvement request which I've posted on the review board.

General comment:  Sampling an order by clause mystifies me -- I don't see how it relates to parallel execution if overall sampling is not desired.  Could we have a release note explaining it?, Yea, I agree it needs explanation.  

I gave a shot at release note just to give my understanding, though I dont know too much and Navis is the expert.  Feel free to take a look and correct as necessary.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12665301, +1, Can you please add the license header, though?, +1 for docs, Committed to trunk. Thanks Szehon and Lefty, for your precious comments., I've forgot to mention that the license header is added. , Doc note:  This adds descriptions for configuration parameters *hive.optimize.sampling.orderby*, *hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.number*, and *hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.percent* which were introduced in Hive 0.12.0 but haven't been documented in the wiki yet.  They belong in the Query and DDL Execution section of Configuration Properties:

* [Configuration Properties -- Query and DDL Execution | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-QueryandDDLExecution], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
