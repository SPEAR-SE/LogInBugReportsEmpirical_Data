[Proposed syntax:

{noformat}
CREATE TABLE ...
STORED AS file_format

file_format:
  : SEQUENCEFILE
  | TEXTFILE
  | INTPUTFORMAT 'MyInputFormat' OUTPUTFORMAT 'MyOutputFormat'
{noformat}

Example:

{noformat}
CREATE TABLE ...
STORED AS
  INPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TextInputFormat'
  OUTPUTFORMAT 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.IgnoreKeyTextOutputFormat'
{noformat}, The patch passes all tests., Looks good to me.

There are a few minor comments:
1. I think instead of hardcoding the class name strings in the variables used to set the input and output formats for sequence and text files, we should instead use the Class.getName() function so that if we move those classes around later, we do not break these strings.
2. Can we make the run time error code better for the case where  negative test case for voids.
, Thanks for the review.  Good comments; patch updated., +1

looks good to me.
, Committed revision 729176. Thanks David!, BTW - this patch may allow reading of tables from arbitrary format - but it will not allow writing to tables of arbitrary outputformat. FileSinkOperator allows writing to sequencefile or textfile only.

perhaps the intent is to only read from other stuff - but the legal syntax is now allowing a capability that the execution engine does not support. (ie. - either we should not support outputformat other than text/sequencefile - or implement support for writing to other outputformats), my bad. should have caught that in the review. The intent was surely to support writes as well., Since this is already committed, I created HIVE-199 to address this.]
