[Eventhough we are skipping the javadocs generation in maven.release command like - 
-X -Dresume=false release:prepare release:perform -DworkingDirectory="${RELEASE_DIRECTORY}" -Darguments="-Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip=true -Dmaven.javadoc.failOnError=false" -Phadoop-2,dist

But that is also not working to ignore javadoc generation during maven release., Added the detailed log (hive_build_javadocs_errors.txt)., Attached patch [HIVE-13030.patch] having missing javadocs which causes maven release build failed., Submitting patch [HIVE-13030.patch], 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:
