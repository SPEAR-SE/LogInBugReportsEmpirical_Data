[I tested this and it looks like it only happens when you use the literal "NULL". When you AND two columns together one of which happens to have NULL values it seems to work as intended.

Are you seeing the same?

I agree that it's still a bug but if this is the only scenario where it happens it'd be an edge case. Or are you seeing this for other queries as well?, It also happens with query below:
{code}
SELECT *
FROM testtbl
WHERE 1=1 AND (map('a',1,'b',2))['c']
{code}

I don't have exact idea what's difference between {{(map('a',1,'b',2))['c']}} and a field which may contains NULL values.
But this case (NULL value from Hive query computation) seems a bit more serious than the scenario of NULL literal for me.
, That's true. Good example, thank you.

I'll try to take a look at this and will assign to me but if anyone gets to it before me please don't hesitate to reassign., Great! (y)]
