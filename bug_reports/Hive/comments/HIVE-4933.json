[The proper usage turns out to be

{code:sql}
SELECT SUM(foo) OVER (PARTITION BY foo) AS bar FROM test;
{code}

I have added documentation to the Wiki for this., Thanks [~lars_francke], this is helpful.  (I added a missing "AS" for the b_sum alias.)

* [PARTITION BY with partitioning, ORDER BY, and window specification | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+WindowingAndAnalytics#LanguageManualWindowingAndAnalytics-PARTITIONBYwithpartitioning,ORDERBY,andwindowspecification], Hey [~leftylev], I had both alias forms in there on purpose to show that either works :) I'll remove one again if that's all right with you., Oh, I missed that completely.  Yes, please do remove it and add a brief explanation in the text.

(Good to know you've got my back.)]
