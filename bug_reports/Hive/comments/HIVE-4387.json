[I patch to make maven-build and maven-publish work with HCatalog.  I wasn't able to test maven-publish in the non-local case since I don't have permissions to push to the repos.  Whoever reviews this needs to test that functionality., Patch is not applying cleanly on trunk., New version of the patch that applies to trunk., Patch applies cleanly but HCatalog jars are getting published in hcatalog namespace instead of hive namespace in local maven repo., I think we should fix this when we move hcatalog into org.apache.hive.  Otherwise we'll have the rather strange situation that classes in the namespace org.apache.hcatalog will be stored in maven in org.apache.hive.  We will also break anyone's pom's that are depending on the existing jars.

As part of moving code into org.apache.hive I can create a pom for org.apache.hcatalog that pull in the new org.apache.hive.hcatalog jars., Ok. Make sense. Than I will only include this in 0.11 branch., Patch looks good. +1
Doesn't apply cleanly on 0.11 though. Can you generate 0.11 version for it?, A version of the patch for branch 0.11., Committed to 0.11. Thanks, Alan!]
