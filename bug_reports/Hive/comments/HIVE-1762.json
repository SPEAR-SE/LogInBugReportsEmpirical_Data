[Hi Todd,

The default delimited SerDe only supports a single character delimiter. You can, however, use another SerDe such as the MultiDelimitSerDe. You can read more about it on the wiki here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/MultiDelimitSerDe.

The relevant issue is HIVE-5871, Implemented by MultiDelimitSerDe, Resolved by MultiDelimitSerDe]
