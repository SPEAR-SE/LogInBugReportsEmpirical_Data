[If "hive.auto.convert.join = false" is set then the all the query stages work OK. The same scenario worked OK in Hive-0.10.0.x and Hive-0.9.x with MapJoin working., This is related to the issue HIVE-4502. I have verified that the plans generated for this query with the existing patch on HIVE-4502 look fine. I will close this based on the resolution of that issue., Vikram : I took a look at JIRA HIVE-4502 and Hortonworks hive-0.11.0.1.3.0.0-170 (HWorx 1.3.0) has HIVE-4502-1.patch already applied in the src. I did verify compiling the source and running the May 20th hive-0.11.0 package and the same failure exists. The HIVE-4502.D10695.patch is not possible because of differences in code. I will report this on JIRA HIVE-4502 as well. So it appears that 4502 is not a fix for this particular issue.  , Correction - typo on my part its hive-0.11.0.1.3.0.0-107 not *-170, Bruce: I meant the patch HIVE-4502.D10695.patch is the one that fixes the issue. HIVE-4502-1.patch is not going to be the patch for it as it does not fix this case. Those differences that you mention is because of the inherent version differences and will need to be resolved. I have attached the results from a test I ran to verify a case similar to yours., Vikram:  I was looking at D10695 and I can how it would work - since patch HIVE-4502-1 is already applied to HWORX's 1.3.0 code I will sharpen my pencil and see what I can do and publish it back to this JIRA. , Bruce,

I have already done that. Once I have the test results, it will be
committed.

Thanks
Vikram.

, HIVE-4502 has been checked in which is suppose to fix the issue. If you can still reproduce feel free to reopen., Ashtoush 

Thanks - I was going to write and see if we have a resolution out of 4502. Will we see a patch in Hortonworks on 0.11 - looks like 0.12 will be the fix. 

Thanks

, Bruce,
I will encourage you to ask this question on Hortonworks mailing list which is the best place to ask questions about Hortonworks distribution. 
The next apache release of Hive will definitely contain this fix.]
