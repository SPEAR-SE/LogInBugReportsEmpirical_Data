[By the way, the debugging I added earlier today (HIVE-2500) proved to be extremely useful when tracking this bug. , Review request at https://reviews.apache.org/r/2361/, Looks like a duplicate of HIVE-2377?
, True, I am sorry for the overlook. Yet, it would be good if any patch for that bug were committed. , I've closed HIVE-2377 as dupe.  Could you add a test case for this one?
, I tried to create a test, but unfortunately the bug doesn't manifest there. This is what I did: https://reviews.apache.org/r/2559/diff/#index_header
Is there a better way to prepare a test that would catch such a bug? , We don't want to create+drop the test database for every .q file.

Instead of creating a new .q file, I think you can add a Java-level testcase to ql/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/metadata/TestHive.java

, Thank you for the response.

The current diff at: https://reviews.apache.org/r/2361/diff/#index_header

I added the appropriate test.

About the previous .q test, I believe that new database wouldn't be created for each .q file, unless also tables like src and src_part are recreated for each .q file - but now it is immaterial anyway.   , +1.  Will commit when tests pass., Committed to trunk.  Thanks Robert!
, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1035 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1035/])
    HIVE-2501. When new instance of Hive (class) is created, the current database
is reset to default.
