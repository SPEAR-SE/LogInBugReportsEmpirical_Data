[[~sseth], can you take a look? Do we have to use mergeAll instead of addAll?  With addAll, both hadoop 1 and 2 should compile., Should be a blocker for 0.14, as it cannot run on hadoop-1., Added a patch that uses a shim for it., Hi [~jxiang], thanks for looking into this. With the patch, what's the behavior if the hadoop version doesn't support mergeCred? I saw runtime exception is thrown. Is this expected?, Yes, a runtime exception is thrown. This is the same behavior with a similar call getMergedCredentials(). Other option could be copying over the credential merging functionality, or just don't do anything (don't merge anything). 

This function is used only in HBaseStorageHandler., +1, pending on test result., +1,
