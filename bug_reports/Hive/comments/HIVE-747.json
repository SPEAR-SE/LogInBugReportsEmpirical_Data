[Good catch.
Does SQL allow union of int with double, or int with string? If it does, we can use FunctionRegistry.getCommonClass() to derive the common type. We should be able to solve this problem with the same shot.
, This is now producing wrong results.

select x from (select 'a' as x from src union all select NULL as x from src)a;

returns NULL for every row.]
