[Great, was hoping for this feature for awhile.  +1.  

Just wondering why do we need to do 'pkill -9' followed by regular 'pkill', ie why do we need to do it twice?, The code executes {{pkill -f java}} then {{pkill -9 -f java}}:
{noformat}
    execHostsIgnoreErrors("pkill -f java");
    execHostsIgnoreErrors("pkill -9 -f java");
{noformat}
but it shows out the opposite in the output file since the commands are sorted:
{noformat}
  protected String getExecutedCommands() {
    List<String> result = Lists.newArrayList();
    result.addAll(returnNotNull(sshCommandExecutor.getCommands()));
    result.addAll(returnNotNull(localCommandFactory.getCommands()));
    result.addAll(returnNotNull(rsyncCommandExecutor.getCommands()));
    Collections.sort(result);
    return Joiner.on("\n").join(result);
  }
{noformat}

We do that because we first tell the processes to terminate normally and then if they do not we force kill them., Got it, the reverse order confused me., Since this is causing some issues I am going to commit this now and then test it on the spark branch., +1 on latest patch, FYI this exposed HIVE-8971.]
