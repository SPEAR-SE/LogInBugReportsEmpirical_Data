[I think this bug should be included in 0.5 since it may cause run time exception and wrong results. , I agree - marked it as a blocker for 0.5, Uploading HIVE-1037.patch. Changes include:
1) moving initTableDesc from joinDesc to CommonJoinOperator to make it after column pruner. 
2) some misc changes in RowContainer including better error reporting.
3) add a new unit test in join40.q, +1

will commit if the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Ning]
