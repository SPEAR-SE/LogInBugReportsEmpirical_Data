[Do you have the query that is failing? I've been trying to reproduce it, but it works fine.

These are the queries I tested:
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> show    
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .>    tables  ;

0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select * 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .>    from persons ;, I think the issue is the space on the right hand side of the semi-colon. Did your queries have that?, I see. Yes, the issue is the trailing spaces at the right of the semi-colon.

0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select * 
. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . .> from persons;<SPACE>
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: ParseException line 1:21 cannot recognize input near 'persons' ';' '<EOF>' in from source (state=42000,code=40000)

Thanks Brock., Here's a patch that does a right trim on every query line so that multiple line queries can be executed.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671243, +1, Is trimming very line a good idea? I think to be consistent with single line case, maybe only trim last line is better choice. 
My suggestion is add
line = line.trim();
before
if (line.endsWith(";")) { line = line.substring(0, line.length() - 1); }, Thanks [~ychena]

I agree with having only one trimming instead of doing it every line. We can reduce extra work on Hive by using your suggestion. I did the test and it worked.

I'll upload another patch., Trim the line once instead of doing it on every line.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671800, +1, Thank you for the contribution Sergo! I have committed this to trunk!, Doc:  Should this bug fix be mentioned in the wiki?

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline Command Options | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], Hi [~leftylev]

I don't think we need to mention it. There is nothing new or improved on how the queries work. 
It fixes user queries mistyped only.
, Thanks [~spena], that's good to know.]
