[Navis, thx for patch.
I tested successufully the build with HIVE-9545.1.patch.txt with IBM Java and openJDK.


, [~ashutoshc] Could you review this? Simple changes of method invocation to reflection., Problem always present for Hive 1.0
Nice patch, tested in v1.0
, Problem present for Hive 1.1 too
Thanks to merge :), Did you plan to integrate this patch ? In which Level ?, Any way we can get these integrated into Hive??? If there are issues getting it integrated please let me know and I will have a discussion with some folks that could hopefully influence gettng these IBM JDK related fixes for Hadoop into trunk..]
