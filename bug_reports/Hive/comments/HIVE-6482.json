[All these libraries except for jersey are under MIT/BSD license or derivatives. 
Only one that I am not sure of is jsersey library license (CDDL) its too long to read. Might as well put it in the NOTICE section to be safe.

An interesting note : JSON license also adds that "The Software shall be used for Good, not Evil" !! :)
, I mean to say that we can remove all the 3rd party library notices from the NOTICE file except for maybe jersey. If someone can verify that it also does not have such an attribution required, we can remove that from NOTICE file as well.
