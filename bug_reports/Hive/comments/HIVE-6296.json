[Hey guys, I'm wondering what the status of this bug is since there has been no activity since it was created., RegexSerde has moved to serde package in org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.RegexSerDe. Can you try that class? o.a.h.h.contrib.serde2.RegexSerDe is there only for backward compatibility and is no longer actively maintained., Oh yeah, that class doesn't seem to have that problem.  Thanks!, Resolving as Won't fix.]
