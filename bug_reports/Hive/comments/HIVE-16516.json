[[~owen.omalley] could you take a look?
...am I right regarding changing this to 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT ...or this property should point to a 'released' version?, +1. I think the idea is that the default should point to a snapshot, otherwise it would be impossible to change anything without a release. Then, the next Hive release would require a s-a release, and would need to point to that., Is this same as HIVE-16396?,
