[cc-ing [~thejas] for review.

Thanks
Hari, +1, Were they ever used?  They've been in the code since 0.12.0 and they're documented in Configuration Properties too:

* [hive.server2.thrift.http.min.worker.threads | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.thrift.http.min.worker.threads]
* [hive.server2.thrift.http.max.worker.threads | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.server2.thrift.http.max.worker.threads]

I recommend removing them from Setting Up HiveServer2 but keeping them in Configuration Properties with a "removed" flag and an explanation that they were never useful (if that's the case)., [~leftylev] Thanks for pointing this out. I looked at the code base and  these parameters were used until HIVE-7935 was checked in. So we should rather mark them as deprecated since 0.14.0 than removing them all together. 

Thanks
Hari, Hari, Thanks for pointing out the jira when this config stopped getting used. 

I believe Lefty is talking about not removing from wiki docs, and saying that the config is not used in versions after 0.14, and directions to use the config that actually works.
, +1,

Thanks for the contribution Hari!
, Looks like 2 test failures are related: 
org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcWithMiniHS2.testNewConnectionConfiguration (HIVE-10309)
org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLFetchHttp (needs a jira?)

cc [~hsubramaniyan] [~thejas]
, I think we can fix org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLFetchHttp also as part of HIVE-10309., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
