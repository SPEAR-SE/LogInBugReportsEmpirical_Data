ATTACHMENT ID: 12859826 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, you may remove commented code. Can you please create RB as well?, Patch 2 fixes test, We can optimize this code path by not introducing this count if we know at compile time that subq will generate atmost 1 row. We can take that up in a follow-up.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12860027 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Pushed to master. Thanks, Vineet!, Did we file a follow-up to optimize for common case of subquery containing an aggregate without gby ?, No not yet, I'll open a JIRA

Edit: opened HIVE-16330]
