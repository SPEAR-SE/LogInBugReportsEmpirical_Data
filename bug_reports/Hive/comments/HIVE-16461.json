[[~sseth] can you take a look?
I actually wonder if the code is no longer used, in the case that I'm looking at the jar is uploaded to session directory, so there should be no collisions. When the session is restarted, the check is performed because both the initial upload and refresh are called. I wonder if some unrelated changed caused the refresh to be called for the same file or if it was always called; regardless, the refresh finds the file and should exit, instead it fails because it checks the source file against remote FS due to the scheme-less path. However, the collision between parallel uploads into the temp dir should be impossible., +1 for the patch.

There's sections of that code, which I suspect, get invoked incorrectly. e.g. Invoking copyFromLocal APIs on files where the actual filesystem has been specified., This method should only be called from local files as far as I see.. at least that is my understanding of tmpjars - they have to be local.,
