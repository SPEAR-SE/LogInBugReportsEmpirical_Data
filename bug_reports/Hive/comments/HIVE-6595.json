[This seems fixed already in HIVE-4496 for 0.12, Is there a patch for 0.11.0? , I tried applying patch "https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12589481/HIVE-4496-2.patch" on relse 0.12.0 and still jdbc compilation fails.

I am not able to compile 0.11.0 and 0.12.0. with Jdk 7., That one is already included in 0.12, so not sure why you still get errors.  

Unfortunately, Hive Jiras are for issues found in current trunk , and not for maintaining old release.  That said, feel free to search hive jira-base for other patches that might have fixed your use-case, or reach out to hive user forum.  Hope that helps., For completeness, could this be accomplished by compiling with the 1.6 JDK?]
