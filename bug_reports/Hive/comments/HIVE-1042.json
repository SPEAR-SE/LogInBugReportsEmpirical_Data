[This needs to be backported to 0.5 also, The error 'FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: AS clause has an invalid number of aliases' is meant to catch queries where the use supplies more than one alias for normal UDF's i.e.:

SELECT concat(a) AS (key, value) FROM src; (invalid)

Because the AST structure for the TRANSFORM clause is slightly different (there is no TOK_SELEXPR), this check is improperly triggered when TRANSFORM was used with a  function that had multiple arguments. , +1

looks good - will commit if the tests pass, Committed in trunk - running tests for 0.5 now, Committed in trunk and 0.5]
