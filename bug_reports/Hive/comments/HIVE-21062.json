[from the explain; it seem it just trims away zeros - and packages it into the minimal type it fits.
Could you try: 1.200?

I think you are looking for the format_number udf to specify the format, {noformat}
it seem it just trims away zeros - and packages it into the minimal type it fits.{noformat}
Yes, that is precisely what is happening, but would you agree that "packages it into the minimal type it fits" might not be the right thing to do?

for 1.200 hive prunes the insignificant zeros, and retains 1.2
{code:java}
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> select 1.200 ;
+------+
| _c0  |
+------+
| 1.2  |
+------+
1 row selected (0.221 seconds)
0: jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000> 
{code}
on older version of hive select 1.0 would return 1.0.
 on hive 1.2
{code:java}
0: jdbc:hive2://node1.ubuntu.localdomain:2181> select 1.0 ;
+------+--+
| _c0  |
+------+--+
| 1.0  |
+------+--+
{code}
