[@Arun: Doesn't look like there's a patch here. Not sure why you changed the status to Patch Available., I am guessing he things that HIVE-2955 is patch available and is the same issue as this one. If that is that case we should just close this as a duplicate., Confirmed fixed in trunk.

{noformat}, Doesn't work on Hive 0.13 or 0.14 (1.0) thus reopening this issue, Ok, problems seems to relate when using a SerDe to read the data, I found the root cause: TBLPROPERTIES ('skip.header.line.count'='1') was specified in the table and that causes the answer not to return., Hi,
Before running the count query, run below-
hive>ANALYZE TABLE stocks PARTITION(<partition_name>) COMPUTE STATISTICS;
hive> select count(*) from stocks where <condition>;
