Is the assumption that if metadata is null, the data is not produced by hive and hence it should skip the conversion ?

( HiveConf.ConfVars.HIVE_PARQUET_TIMESTAMP_SKIP_CONVERSION.defaultBoolVal is the default value in HiveConf.java and hence always true, as long as HiveConf.java default remains same).
, Yes (by guesswork).  The person reporting the issue was trying to read new Parquet data written by Spark., Thanks. LGTM
