[[~hagleitn] [~prasanth_j] [~mmokhtar] [~gopalv] many queries in TPCDS suffer from the problem where there are 1000s of reducers (sometimes, 3 stages of 600-700 reducers each); this is running on 6 nodes with ~6 slots each. Not sure if this is caused just by the stats problem or there are other problems with physical optimizer, but it seems like a big perf issue that we should address soon. , [~sershe]:  I met similar overflow problem when i running TPC-DS/query17 on Hive on Spark, the explain is in the [link|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12875204/query17_explain.log].  what's the root cause of the problem?, I do not recall... [~prasanth_j] do you remember if this has been fixed somewhere? I think it was.]
