[[~vikram.dixit], [~gopalv] - Please review when you find time., Repoted by a user as well. Can we get a list of versions affected by this & file backports?

LGTM  - +1, Affects master / branch-1 / branch-1.0 / branch-1.x / branch-0.14. Same patch (as it is removal of the l4j) should apply on all branches and can be cherry picked?. Plz let me know if individual backport JIRAs should be created., It should be ok to commit and cherry-pick without extra jiras,
