[I am running hive 0.9.0 and when Hadoop is stopped, I get the following error message indicating the hive cannot connect to hdfs://localhost:9000 (hadoop fs.default.name):

hive> create table test ( i int );
create table test ( i int )
FAILED: Error in metadata: MetaException(message:Got exception: java.net.ConnectException Call to localhost/127.0.0.1:9000 failed on connection exception: java.net.ConnectException: Connection refused)
FAILED: Execution Error, return code 1 from org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.DDLTask
, I just ran into this error while Hadoop daemons were running but the problem was that the Hive Metastore was running (backed by the embedded Derby database) and the hive client was running in embedded mode and also trying to connect to the embedded Derby database. Perhaps there are multiple common misconfigurations that result in this error., I wasn't able to reproduce the problem with the latest trunk: even if the hadoop daemons are down, creating table actually succeeds without seeing the error msg. [~mgrover] Could you please try to see if you can reproduce it? , [~xuefuz] did you have your environment configured such that fs.default.name pointed at HDFS?  I have seen this same error when I didn't have mysql in my lib/ and was configured to use a mysql metastore., Yes. I had. I can understand the error message in case of metastore not running or running normally, which is your case. However, but problem described above is about when hadoop daemons are not running. In my case, metastore was running normally, but hdfs/mr were all down. In such case, I didn't see the mentioned error msg., Let merry to reproduce it.


, Stupid autocorrect! I meant to say let me try to reproduce it:-), [~mgrover] were you able to reproduce? If not, I think we can close this one. Thanks., Sorry, Xuefu, I haven't had the time. If you can't reproduce this, please go ahead and mark this as Cant' reproduce.

Thanks for checking!]
