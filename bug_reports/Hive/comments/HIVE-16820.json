ATTACHMENT ID: 12871097 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~sseth] ping?
[~hagleitn] maybe you can review, Sorry for the delay.

- Should isShutdown be volatile for visibility outside of the dagLock synchronized block?
- Think it is possible for two invocations of tryKillDag. submitDag sets this.dagClient. shutdown sees this, and invokes tryKillDag. the submit thread starts up again and sees isShutdown=true.

Otherwise, looks good., 1) Not necessary, the only check outside of the lock is opportunistic and it's ok for it to fail.
2) submit thread checks a local variable that is set under lock and is true only if dagClient was not set; renamed to make it more clear., Rebasing, and a small update based on CR,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12872384 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1. I'd still change the isShutdown to a volatile, before commit, for the one opportunistic check to be more consistent., Committed to master after making the change. Thanks for the review!, [~sershe], I wonder if a similar fix should go into {{MergeFileTask::execute()}}, to check for cancellation before job-submission. , MergeFileTask doesn't appear to implement shutdown at all. So, execute is safe from interference :), bq. MergeFileTask doesn't appear to implement shutdown at all.

:] Ah, but doesn't it need one? It is conceivable that a user might cancel a query between the TezTask and the MergeFileTask, (or simply interrupt an {{ALTER TABLE CONCATENATE}}). In that case, the merge will run through to the end, in spite of cancellation. 

I wonder if there isn't value in applying the HIVE-12556 + HIVE-16820 treatment for MergeFileTask as well., Yeah, what I was saying is that we don't need the same bugfix for that task cause there's no implementation. It probably does need an implementation (without bugs like this)., bq. Yeah, what I was saying is that we don't need the same bugfix for that task ...
Right. Sorry, I didn't mean to imply otherwise.

bq. It probably does need an implementation (without bugs like this).
I'm working on it. Our fix for this was not as complete/correct as yours. I'll extend this for {{MergeFileTask}}., Thanks! I'd be happy to review, I've filed HIVE-17273 for extending this to {{MergeFileTask}}, so that I don't drop the ball on this. Thanks, [~sershe]!, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
