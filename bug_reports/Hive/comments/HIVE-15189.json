[This is by design.  Work needs to be done in Spark to make it so that it understands the delta files (including which ones to read).  Note also that it's possible with ACID tables to have multiple base files simultaneously (since it works by keeping multiple versions of the data and using the metadata to determine which version a given reader should see), and I assume this would mess up spark readers as well.

You can work around the situation by forcing a major compaction before you read the data by doing "alter table compact" (see https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-AlterTable/PartitionCompact ),]
