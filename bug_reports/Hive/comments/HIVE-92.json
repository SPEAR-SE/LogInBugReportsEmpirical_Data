[during semantic analysis phase,  treat

subq1 union subq2 as

select * from (subq1 union subq2) dummysubq


, for now, catch this and throw and error during semantic analysis - this should be supported later, Looks good to me. 

I would however fix the error message to say use subquery for union 

instead of union value.

Please file a separate enhancement for the full union fix..., +1 

looks good. Maybe file another jira to allow subq1 union subq2?, Raghu, can you accept again: changed error mesg to not have the column name at the end, +1
