create table lines(string line)

Instead of saying "Identifier", it should say "Type" or "column type".
, Hi Carl,

I think you are mistaken as to what is causing the problem. The name 'LINES' is a reserved token, hence it is not a valid identifier. For example if you try create table lines(line string) you will see the same error message. The request for a valid identifier by the parser is correct. I will look at adding a patch which outputs the token which is not a valid identifier if this case so that when a reserved word is used it is clearer.

Cheers,

Holden

P.S.

I could be wrong this is my first time digging through the hive code., I tried to create a reviewboard account, but registration seems to be broken. I've attached a patch which should result in a clearer error message.]
