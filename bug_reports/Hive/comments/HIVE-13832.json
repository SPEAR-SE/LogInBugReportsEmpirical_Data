[[~sershe], {{llap-server/sql/serviceCheckScript.sql}} does not have a license header. I moved it to {{llap-server/scripts/serviceCheckScript.sql}}, as {{\*\*/scripts/\*}} is already excluded for rat in the POM file. Is that OK?

If all the rest looks good, could you +1 too? Thanks, [~vikram.dixit] this was a part of HIVE-13438, is it ok to move it? Is there some test? Maybe there could just be a license header added.
The rest looks ok, [~vikram.dixit], I guess then I have to update {{packaging/src/main/assembly/bin.xml}} to reference the new folder and rest should be fine, right?, Unfortunately, ambari project depends on a specific location of this script. I have added a specific exclude for the file. If in case in the future, we end up having more such sql scripts, we can exclude that directory., The output folder in {{packaging/src/main/assembly/bin.xml}} would be still the same, thus that should not impact Ambari? It is not such a big deal to add a single file to the rat exclusions, but it would be a bit more robust to use the same convention for the whole project i.e. storing within the _scripts_ folder. And that would avoid future additional changes., I think in that case, a change in bin.xml is missing in the original patch. That would work too!, Exactly, that is what I thought. I uploaded the new patch, could you check? Thanks!, +1, {noformat}
