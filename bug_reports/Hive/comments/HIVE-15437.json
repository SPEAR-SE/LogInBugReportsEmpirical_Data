[The root cause is when getSchema for avro table, it compare splits path with table path by only matching same start string. This makes table1_1 got table1's schema, then cause the Exception later.

    HIVE-15437 Progress Bar on Beeline client

    Have a common strategy to rendering the in place updates from both the hive cli and beeline. Various summary updates once the tez job is completed are no longer rendered with fancy colors. There is a possible condition where the logRunnable thread requests progress update from the server before the session state is updated with relevant object (TezJobMonitor in this case) to provide information. In this case no progress bar will be displayed.
