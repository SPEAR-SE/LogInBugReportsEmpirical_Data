[What version of Hive are you using?, It's Hive 0.13.

I am trying to find top urls for a particular key by writing customized UDAF. The URL size can be very long up to 250 characters.

In stack trace, I do not see the calls to UDF, so I am assuming this is something Hive does internally., Note that this exception can happen because of an integer math overflow [1], if the BytesWritable size is > Integer.MAX_VALUE / 3 (about 682MB). 

[1] https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/io/BytesWritable.java#L123, Yes, this can happen with any particular version, which causes the integer math overflow., Looks like a duplicate of HADOOP-11901and MAPREDUCE-21, Resolving this as the Hadoop version was updated from 2.7.2 [1] in Hive 2.3.3 to 3.1.0 [2] in Hive 3.0.0 (HADOOP-11901 was fixed in Hadoop 2.8.0).
