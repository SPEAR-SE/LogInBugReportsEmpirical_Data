[Accomplished in a manner similar to what happens in the map-reduce path of the code. , Removed cruft., RB?

- next power of two in java can be done in a simpler way: 
{code}
j = Integer.higestOneBit(i);
i==j return i : j<<1;
{code}

- We shouldn't change the default for BYTESPERREDUCER. If we want a different default for TEZ we should probably create a different var.
- The comment should mention what happens with multi parent reduce-work
- There seems to be some dead code at the end of the file
- The setting of the var can be broken into separate method in the class
- If the reducesink specifies a specific number of reducers, do we need to carry that number through additional stages? Right now you will add other stuff to it during the walk.]
