[The steBatchSize exception happens when moving from the HBase metastore to the sql metastore, even with MinTezCluster. Will attach a small patch for this shortly. [~mmccline] - may need some help from you on this. We should at least figure out if these are product issues or test issues., I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release.]
