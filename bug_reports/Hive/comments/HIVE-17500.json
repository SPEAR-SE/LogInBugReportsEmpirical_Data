[Looks like the tez.tar.gz file in HDFS is a directory?

The expectation is that the tez.tar.gz inside tez.lib.uris is actually a tar.gz file. Is that true - can you do a fs -ls -R of the path inside tez.lib.uris?, Thanks For reply. 
1. Yes tez.tar.gz file in HDFS
2. i checked that is not directory. that directory is created by hive code while copying.
LlapServiceDriver.java
lfs.mkdirs(tezDir);
fs.copyToLocalFile(new Path(tezLibs), new Path(libDir, "tez.tar.gz"));

3. sh-4.2$ bin/hadoop fs -ls -R  /apps/tez/tez.tar.gz
-rw-r--r--   1 rananara supergroup   44822304 2017-09-11 23:13 /apps/tez/tez.tar.gz

4. I am trying to enable hive LLAP and following below document. please share if any  comprehensive document to install slide and LLAP
