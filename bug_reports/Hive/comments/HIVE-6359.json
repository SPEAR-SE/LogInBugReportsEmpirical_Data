, Should this bug fix be mentioned in the wiki, with version information?

* [HiveServer2 Clients:  Beeline Command Options |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], Yes, I think we can put a note for the -f option about this bug in 0.12 and earlier, as this is not something that is easy to debug, and people could have tabs in their script files.
, Done, please review -f option in Beeline wikidoc (link 2 comments back)., The wikidoc update LGTM
, Thanks, night owl.]
