[Seems duplicate of [HIVE-17312|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-17312], I think it's related, but strictly speaking doesn't seem to be the same. Probably both share the same root cause. The views are still usable in HIVE-19896 and we're seeing malformation specifically on the 'original' text, which as I understand it is not on any query execution path.]
