[Patch has been uploaded to https://reviews.apache.org/r/44664/ for review. [~spena] could you take a look, thanks., Should we add some q-test on {{encryption_drop_partition.q}} for external table/partitions as well?, Add tests for drop partitions of an external table., In {{encryption_drop_partition.q}}, I see you're dropping the external table with purge:
{noformat}
+DROP TABLE encrypted_ext_table_dp;
+
+SELECT * FROM encrypted_table_dp;
 ALTER TABLE encrypted_table_dp DROP PARTITION (p='2014-09-23');
 SELECT * FROM encrypted_table_dp;
 ALTER TABLE encrypted_table_dp DROP PARTITION (p='2014-09-23') PURGE;
 SELECT * FROM encrypted_table_dp;
+DROP TABLE encrypted_ext_table_dp PURGE;
{noformat}

Didn't you mean to drop {{encrypted_table_dp}} instead?, Thanks [~spena]. A good catch. Yes, I meant encrypted_table_dp. I will create another patch for it., Uploaded a new patch with the fix to a typo in table name.,
