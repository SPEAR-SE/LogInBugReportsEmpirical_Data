[patch that fixes the build issues with the new tree., +1
reviewed manually. looks good for now.

though we need to move to a directory structure that is similar to that of hadoop. (hive/trunk/src/ql hive/trunk/src/metastore), This was checked in by Zheng., Why are we including a snapshot Hadoop build?  Shouldn't we use HADOOP_HOME?, You can point to an existing hadoop build using the -Dhadoop.jar to point to the location of the hadoop jar also setting hadoop.bin.path and hadoop.config.dir while running the tests.

We decided to bundle hadoop jars (similar to what hbase and pig have done) in order to make it easy to check out hive and test it without having to build and deploy hadoop as well.

However, we are going to move away from this model and use ivy to handle the dependencies and then all these jars will go away.
, I checked HBase and Pig and they both include the Hadoop jar, so I guess that's the accepted way.  Seems like we only need a single Hadoop jar in lib?

svn mv hadoopcore/lib/hadoop-0.20.0-dev-core.jar lib/
svn rm hadoopcore
