[Changed component from "Build Infrastructure" to "Query Processor", I guess you mean that Parser needs to distinguish queries that produce results and those that does not? Like functions with or without returning values?

how do you compare that with doing the check in the compiler step?
, One good thing about doing the check in compiler is that it's easier to output some meaningful error message to the user.

The parser's error message probably won't be easy to understand, for this case.
, There is no check currently. The above query actually succeeds, changed error message on raghu's suggestion, +1

looks good., Committed revision 724923., HIVE-103. Disable inserts in sub queries. (Namit Jain through zshao)]
