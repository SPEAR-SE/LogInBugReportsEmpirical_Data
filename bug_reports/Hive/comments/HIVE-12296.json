[I am thinking instead of going through the traditional subquery path of rewriting this kind of subquery as left semijoin, that this can be just treated as:

{noformat}
SELECT
t1.bigint_col_3
FROM table_3 t1
WHERE
(t1.bigint_col_3) IN (0.0)
{noformat}

That is turn the "select 0.0..." subquery of a constant, into a constant 0.0, without the select operator, for this edge case.

I am kind of new to subquery, so just a thought.]
