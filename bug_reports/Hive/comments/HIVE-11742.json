[If folks agree with the change, I'd like to use this JIRA to contribute to Hive. Please assign it to me., I didn't know that last_value behaves like that for {{last_value(x) over (partition by y order by z)}}. Seems it will have different behaviors from windowing function {{last_value(x) over (partition by y order by z rows between x preceding and y following)}} and may confuse people. I think it makes sense to make the change. 

Of course it 's non-compatible change. We may have to add a configuration to allow enabling the new behavior. ]
