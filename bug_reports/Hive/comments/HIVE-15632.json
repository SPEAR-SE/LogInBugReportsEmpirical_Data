[there is no limit on timeseries query. , [~jcamachorodriguez] Can this be closed , since CALCITE-1577 is resolved ?, I think we could keep it till we upgrade to Calcite 1.12.0 so we can keep track., This appears to have stalled. When is the upgrade going to happen?, I am deferring this to Hive 3.0 as we are going to cut the first RC and it is not marked as blocker. Please feel free to commit to the branch if this can be resolved before the release., Fixed with upgrade to Calcite 1.12 (HIVE-15708)., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
