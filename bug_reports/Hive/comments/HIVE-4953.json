[adding 
{noformat}
ivy.settings.file=${ivy.conf.dir}/ivysettings.xml
{noformat}
in build.properties and 
{noformat}
ant clean package -Doffline=true -Dbuild.profile=nohcat
{noformat}
is working. But I cannot make hcatalog built offline., Shall we add the line ivy.settings.file=${ivy.conf.dir}/ivysettings.xml in build.properties?, Its almost not worth worrying about. I am moving pretty quickly with maven based build. I can not suffer through ant's slow builds any longer.]
