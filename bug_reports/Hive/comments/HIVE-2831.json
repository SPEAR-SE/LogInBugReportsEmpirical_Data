[Running the 'dfs' command on 0.20 produces the following output:

{noformat}
hive> dfs -rmr ../build/test_dboutput_db;
Deleted file:/data/users/sdong/www/open-source-hive3/build/test_dboutput_db
{noformat}

But on 0.23 the output of FsShell commands has changed slightly:
{noformat}
hive> dfs -rmr ../build/test_dboutput_db;
Deleted ../build/test_dboutput_db
{noformat}

This difference is causing test failures in TestConbribCliDriver.dboutput and TestCliDriver.input45
, db_output was one of my creations. I have two thoughts. I believe we have version specific unit tests. I wonder if we can setup the script to write to a table location wearhouse/db and then just drop the table when done., @Ed: I think in the past we have handled problems like this by updating the list of strings that diff should ignore. The patch I just attached does the same., cwsteinbach requested code review of "HIVE-2831 [jira] Mask FsShell output in QTestUtil".
