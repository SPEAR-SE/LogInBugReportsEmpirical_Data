ATTACHMENT ID: 12633236, Test failures are unrelated., Committed to trunk, Q1:  Why doesn't this jira have a fix version number?

Q2:  Should this change be mentioned in the wiki?  For example, here:

* [Getting Started:  Error Logs |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/GettingStarted#GettingStarted-ErrorLogs], I'll assume this doesn't need to be documented in the wiki., Changing fix version to 0.14.0, since this is not committed on branch-0.13, and was only committed on 0.14 trunk., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
