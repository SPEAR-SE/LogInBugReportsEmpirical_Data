[This has been fixed in the meanwhile. I just tested and got this:

Hive CLI:
{quote}
FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10042]: Line 1:7 . Operator is only supported on struct or list of struct types 'x'
{quote}

Beeline:
{quote}
Error: Error while compiling statement: FAILED: SemanticException [Error 10042]: Line 1:7 . Operator is only supported on struct or list of struct types 'x' (state=42000,code=10042)
{quote}]
