ATTACHMENT ID: 12621663, It looks like the db removal was added to address the issue of db/tables being left behind by other tests. You can probably do a git blame/log to find the jiras that led to this being done.
Would it be a a reasonable solution to do a best-effort deletion of db/tables (don't stop running tests if cleanup fails).

, Haven't been seeing this. Marking as cannot reproduce., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
