, done, Why did you disable precommit tests for this?, this is a webhcat only change, specifically around job submission. There are no unit tests that cover this, Alright. +1 for hive.14, Thanks [~thejas] for the review., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
