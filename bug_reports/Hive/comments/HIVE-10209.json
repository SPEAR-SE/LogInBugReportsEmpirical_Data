[Also, sorry if I missing anything obvious, but:
{code}
select * from src where key < 10 limit 1;
{code}

shouldn't need to do a full table scan, right? As long as we've find some row that key is less than 10, we should return immediately., Looks like it's hard to change ExecMapper.done to be non-static.
This patch set it to false when initializing a FetchTask.,
