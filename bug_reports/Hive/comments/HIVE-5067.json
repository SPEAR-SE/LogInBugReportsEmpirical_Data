[I would like to test orc + bzip2 for cold data compression and have a quick imp with BZip2Compressor in [apache common compress|http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-compress/] based on SnappyCodec.java . Right now I just implement the CompressionCodec interface only.

 According to my test, orc + bzip2 doesn't have significant improvement on data compression compared to orc + zlib and it takes more time to complete the compression. Please correct me if I'm wrong., Try increasing orc.compress.size to the bzip2's 900kb block size.,
