, Aren't some of these fixes in HIVE-5897?, Ah! yes. I missed HIVE-5897 thinking of HIVE-5894. Some of the required changes are there. Do you want to add some of these there or should I provide an incremental patch here considering that HIVE-5897 is ready to go in? I don't think HIVE-5897 is sufficient by itself. It needs the changes in this jira as well. Let me know.

Thanks
Vikram.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12616930, I think we should should add them to HIVE-5897. Do you want to assign HIVE-5897 to yourself and then add the items added here? Then we can mark this one resolved as duplicate., Adding all these changes to HIVE-5897.]
