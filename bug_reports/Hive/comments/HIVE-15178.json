[[~prasanth_j] fyi
Actually I suspect that ORC stripe merge needs proper split generation.
I can probably fix the settings propagation, but the target size (merge resolver uses target size for split sizes for the MR job) is taken from some config setting, so it can still produce invalid splits that are not on stripe boundaries., Not sure how it ever worked cause these settings are never propagated in merge task. Maybe it worked because the default split size is large and we always want to merge into one file.
