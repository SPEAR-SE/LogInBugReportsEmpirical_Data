Reviewers: JIRA

  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2746

  Corrected log message to print exception message instead of reference address.

  LOG.error(e.getStackTrace()) in current code prints memory location of StackTraceElement[] instead of message.

  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStoreClient.java:292 Is there any point in trying to set the ugi if the connection failed? Maybe this should be raised directly from the catch block above?

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStoreClient.java:292 No, in the catch block above exception is only logged, not thrown, because thats within a for loop of retries. Connection may succeed in a retry. We can't throw exception there.

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStoreClient.java:292 Ok, but then shouldn't this block be moved above the preceding one where we try to set the ugi? If we're not connected won't the set_ugi operation fail anyway with a LoginException?

INLINE COMMENTS
  metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/HiveMetaStoreClient.java:292 Ok, I think I'm getting confused by the inconsistent indentation in this method (can you fix that?). It looks to me like the block of code that attempts to set the ugi should be taken out of the for-loop and moved below the !isConnected check. Does that make sense? Otherwise we're just polluting the log with noise every time a connection attempt fails.

Reviewers: JIRA, cwsteinbach

  Incorporated Carl's suggestions. Fixed indentation. Moved both setugi functionality as well as secure transport setup outside of for loop, since retrials are for transport.open() and that code doesn't belong in for loop.
