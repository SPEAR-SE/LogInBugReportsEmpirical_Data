[Tagged as an outage for branch-1.2, +1 for inclusion to it.,  I was unaware of the "<=>" operator.

@Description(name = "<=>", value = "a FUNC b - Returns same result with EQUAL(=) operator " +
"for non-null operands, but returns TRUE if both are NULL, FALSE if one of the them is NULL"), After discussion with Gunther, marking this for 1.2.1 instead of 1.2.0, since vectorization is optional by default, and so, there is a workaround. If this makes it before we're done with the RC process, we will include it in 1.2.0 itself, but we will not consider it a blocker for the 1.2.0 release.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12731058 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Removing fix version of 1.2.0 in preparation of release, since this is not a blocker for 1.2.0., So if I understand this, the fast/native vectorized map join will be disabled if it contains nullsafe operations, but it can still use the older vectorized MapJoinOperator.

+1, Correct., Committed to master and branch-1.2.]
