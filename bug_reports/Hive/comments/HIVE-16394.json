ATTACHMENT ID: 12862216 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The test failures are not related to this patch., Committed to 3.0.0. Thanks [~xuefuz], [~lirui] for review., Should this change be documented in the wiki?

* [Hive on Spark: Getting Started | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Spark%3A+Getting+Started], Thanks [~leftylev]. This property is not HoS specific and already works in HoMR, so I think it is not needed to be documented separately., Okay, thanks Chaoyu Tang., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
