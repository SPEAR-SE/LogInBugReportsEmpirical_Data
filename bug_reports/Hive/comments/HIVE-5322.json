[I won't be able to get to fixing this today. So it would be great if anyone can take a stab at it.

Supporting 20.2 is not trivial work ! (cc [~appodictic])

, I'll take at a stab at it., Lol. Do what I do. Just don't run with that dumb kerberos stuff, all it does is slow you down :), +1 . I verified that the TestJdbcDriver2 tests which were failing earlier pass with this patch. I will commit it soon, without waiting for the 24hrs as the unit tests are broken without this.
, Thanks to [~jnp] for helping diagnose the root cause of the unit test failures!
, Maybe we could add a meaningful unit test. 1) Create dir 2)get permissions something like that., Committed to trunk and 0.12 branch. THanks [~mwagner] for the contribution and the very quick turn around!

[~appodictic] Sorry, I saw your comment only after committing the patch. Yes, a unit test for checking if the permission setting of scratch dir works would be useful. Shall I create a follow up jira for that and mark this as resolved?

, 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass

This message is automatically generated., No. Lets not do the follow up. The moment has passed :), I guess it's late, but here's a follow up patch for a test case., [~mwagner] Thats a nice and clean test case. Can you please create a new jira and upload it there? 
That will help keep a 1:1 mapping for the commits and jiras.
