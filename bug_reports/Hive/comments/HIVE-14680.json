[[~prasanth_j] [~gopalv] can you take a look? I need to test this in a cluster, too, Tested the patch on cluster. When it doesn't hit HIVE-14608, it behaves very well... during node restarts, after node restarts, flexing the cluster down and back up, and the a higher size from down, too, cache hit ratio stays high as expected. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12826920 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~prasanth_j] [~gopalv] [~hagleitn] ping?, I've been thinking about how this will jump through locality preferences.

{code}
 index = Hashing.consistentHash(hash1 + iter * hash2, locations.length);
{code}, Added a silly test, Does the silly test test anything? Otherwise may as well delete it. Maybe add a non-silly test., It's a golden-file-style test. It tests that the distributions fall within parameters that were determined by running the test, looking at results, and deciding that they are ok; then encoding that as acceptable results.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12828315 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Mostly looks good.
Slots start at 0, correct?

{code}// Since our probing method is totally bogus, give up after some time and return everything.{code}
Think it'll be better to return nothing. That'll cause the scheduler to go random. Everything has a good chance of overwhelming a box - at least without grouping. With grouping, it may spread out.

Would be good to display the number of expected instances on the LlapWebService (it shows the ones which are up and running only). Could probably show the ones which have gone down, with the isAlive set to false. Separate jira?

[~gopalv] - any comments on the second level hash function, and how it moves between hosts with the (+1 * hash2)

{code}startOffset >> 2{code}
This is unrelated to this patch specifically, but related to the series of patches. This is trying to avoid differences in the start position, correct? Upto a difference of 4. Will it work for splits that don't start at 0?

Yes startOffset is rounded to 4 bytes., Updated the patch,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12828315 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Displaying them as inactive, or at least showing the expected / requested count would be useful.

Does the 4 byte offset fix work, if a split starts at something like 30MB into a file., +1 for the latest patch., Note that we don't even know where they executed (by definition since we know they are inactive due to the fact that the znodes are not there), and we also don't know if the slots are empty because of temporary failure or resize. So we cannot display anything other than a missing slot.

As for removing the 2 lowest bits, yes :P,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12828889 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, bq. As for removing the 2 lowest bits, yes
Let me clarify the question.
Block boundary is 30MB. Split via read-footers generates the split start 30MB + 3 bytes. Split without reading footer generates the start-offset as 30MB.
Will removing the 2 lower bits provide the same start offset for both splits. Otherwise these splits are not consistent, and will not go to the same node. 30MB is probably a bad example. Will this work in all cases (32MB -2 bytes)., The off-by value is usually the file magic for the ORC file "ORC" (3 bytes). BISplit will ignore it & do (0+32Mb), the ETLSplit will start at the 1st stripe (3+33.99Mb).

This is not expected to happen for any split other than stripe #1 of a file., [~sseth] I was assuming the normal block/split boundaries were k*large-ish power of two, so this would suffice.
Apparently there's no such restriction. +-3 can affect another bit, however if we make no assumptions about split boundaries, we cannot tell which way the 3 goes (e.g. for 31323, we don't know if it has to be consistent with 31320 or 31326). I guess we can just remove an extra bit., One-byte change.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12829250 - jenkins-PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Committed to master. Thanks for the review!, Really think we're better off fixing this within Orc itself - instead of working around it in the split generator (which at some point will handle different file types). Can the ORC getSplits not deal with this in BI mode?]
