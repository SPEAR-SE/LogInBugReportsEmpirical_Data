ATTACHMENT ID: 12702420 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, LGTM (but I'm not a Hive committer)., Hmm. *--- thinks how to sweeten the deal --- *
OK. If this gets committed I promise to write a test case of the committer's choosing.
AND, if AvroSerializer class is made public (we use is elsewhere in our code to convert Hive objects to avro) I promise to write 2!  , +1
, [~rdsr], I have a rebased and updated version of HIVE-4734 which I was preparing to post. If this is going to also be an issue for Records, Byte arrays, fixeds, enums, etc. then we may just want to wait for that, which will pass the full Avro record all the way through the serializer. I should have some time to finish testing and post that next week., Sorry, I just realized that this is limited to the serialization side, so maybe my previous comment isn't as applicable., Committed to trunk., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
