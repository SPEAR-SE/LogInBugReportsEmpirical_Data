ATTACHMENT ID: 12682017 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch committed to trunk. Thanks for the review Vaibhav, Deepesh.
, Doc note:  This changes the defaults for configuration parameters *hive.hmshandler.retry.attempts* and *hive.hmshandler.retry.interval* in HiveConf.java.  They were introduced in Hive 0.10.0 by HIVE-3484 but aren't documented in the wiki yet.  So the Metastore section of Configuration Properties needs to document them with the original defaults and new values.

* [Configuration Properties -- MetaStore | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-MetaStore]

By the way, *hive.hmshandler.force.reload.conf* also needs to be documented (HIVE-3484).]
