[Going to close this as not an issue. The issue described happens with regular HoS explain plans, and in Hive-on-MR. It's confusing to me that there would be a section in the explain plan called {{Local Work}} and it would be empty, but maybe thats by design.

Hive-on-Tez doesn't have this issue since it doesn't use the {{MapredLocalTask}}.]
