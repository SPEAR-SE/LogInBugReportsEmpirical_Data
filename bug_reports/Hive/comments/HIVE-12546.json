[[~xuefuz] fyi, CC: [~Ferd]. I believe the problem is with IOS only, a known issue. It worked for my linux box the last time I checked., Hi [~sershe], could you tell me which OS you are using?, Mac ssh to a Linux box. CLI on the same session (same terminal to the same Linux box on the same Mac :)) doesn't have the problem., Hi[~sershe]
I also tried with OS X(10.11.6) terminal, it works fine with ssh.

can we close this?, Hmm.. sure. I may reopen if I get a repro., Close it since we can't reproduce it now. Feel free to reopen it once you can.]
