[The patch. I've run a few queries with it. Need to perf test the normal case to see if there's too much overhead., Ran a few queries and I don't see IO time increasing. Will test further next week., [~prasanth_j] [~gopalv] do you want to review some time? :) 
I made patch for branch-2 for now, will forward-port to master.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12874344 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The master patch is going to be almost the same as branch-2 patch until the off-heap metadata patch is committed. Or, if this is committed first, that one would have to be adjusted, [~gopalv] ping?, Meant to +1 - this hasn't been perf tested, so will return to this if I find these functions in my profile runs., Committed to branches. Thanks for the review!, Doc note & question:  This adds *hive.llap.io.trace.size* and *hive.llap.io.trace.always.dump* to HiveConf.java, so they need to be documented in the wiki.

The default value of *hive.llap.io.trace.always.dump* was true in the initial commit but changed to false in an addendum commit (#20276d2113f669a2ea08480ce76df9bd6b913d09 and #726f270a6e5c720a98ac58f2c4a549e70b45fbad).

* [Configuration Properties -- LLAP I/O | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-LLAPI/O]

Added a TODOC2.4 label.

Question:  In the description of *hive.llap.io.trace.always.dump*, what does "the default is on error" mean?  It was in the initial commit as well as the addendum commit, so I'm not sure if it refers to the true or false value., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
