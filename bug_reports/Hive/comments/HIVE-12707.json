[Reserved keywords by hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords are as below i think

ALL, ALTER, ARRAY, AS, AUTHORIZATION, BETWEEN, BIGINT, BINARY, BOOLEAN 
, BOTH, BY, CREATE, CUBE, CURRENT_DATE, CURRENT_TIMESTAMP, CURSOR, DATE, DECIMAL, DELETE, DESCRIBE 
, DOUBLE, DROP, EXISTS, EXTERNAL, FALSE, FETCH, FLOAT, FOR, FULL, GRANT 
, GROUP, GROUPING, IMPORT, IN, INNER, INSERT, INT, INTERSECT, INTO, IS, LATERAL 
, LEFT, LIKE, LOCAL, NONE, NULL, OF, ORDER, OUT, OUTER, PARTITION 
, PERCENT, PROCEDURE, RANGE, READS, REVOKE, RIGHT 
, ROLLUP, ROW, ROWS, SET, SMALLINT, TABLE, TIMESTAMP, TO, TRIGGER, TRUE 
, TRUNCATE, UNION, UPDATE, USER, USING, VALUES, WITH 
, REGEXP, RLIKE

Quoted Identifiers can be an alternative

CREATE TABLE cazenTest(`INTERVAL` STRING);
{code}, Thanks [~Cazen] .. we had used the workaround .. but all the upstream queries also needed the backticks as well . , [~rajsaha], INTERVAL is one of the reserved key words. It is there even before HIVE-6617. The only way to use it as an identifier is through backticks. Thanks., I also edit the document for reserved key words. "Note, set hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords=false will only enable part of the reserved keywords to be used as identifier without backticks. Some of the reserved keywords, such as INTERVAL was always a reserved key word even before hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords was introduced. Thus, the only way to use it as an identifier is through backticks.", Actually in hive 0.14.0.2.2.6.0-2800 , I could create the table with INTERVAL column name without backtic

But in Hive 1.2.1 it fails

{noformat}, [~rajsaha], let me double check., [~rajsaha], here is the story with timeline: Hive 0.14 was released based on commits on Wed Nov 12 20:35:15 2014 (Since INTERVAL was not introduced yet, you are free to use it as identifier). The flag "hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords" was introduced on Tue Mar 10 22:00:41 2015. (Since INTERVAL was not introduced yet, you are free to use it as identifier whether you set the flag or not). "INTERVAL" was introduced on Thu Mar 19 19:05:28 2015 (see HIVE-9792 : Support interval type in expressions/predicates ), and they reserved it.... Sounds like the people who checked in HIVE-9792 did not consider the backward compatibility of "interval". So, if it really makes trouble for you, i can add it back to the list. But as you know, we are planning to deprecate the flag in the next release or two., [~pxiong] Thanks  for the help. Actual this backward compatibility missing is making trouble for our platform users as they have use backtics for every query they write , even after we added backtic in schema . To me it would be nice if we can have consistency in these reserved keywords and hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords is a nice way to deal with backward compatibility. So to me it would be very helpful for users if we can add INTERVAL in hive.support.sql11.reserved.keywords list., cc'ing [~hagleitn], [~hagleitn], I think you are the most appropriate people to help review the patch if you agree that we should add the backward support for "Interval". :) Thanks!, I got the following error when I compile it locally

I guess the grammar after adding interval becomes too complicated.]
