[My proposed solution for this is to add a check inside ExprNodeGenericFuncDesc.newInstance for GenericUDFOPOr and GenericUDFOPAnd:

If the given ObjectInspector would be a Void Type, create a Constant Boolean one instead w/ a null value., Resubmitting due to Jenkins precommit job exec errors., I think the approach is right, but I think it could moved to TypeCheckProcFactory - and keep AND/OR related type logic outside of the "Desc"
