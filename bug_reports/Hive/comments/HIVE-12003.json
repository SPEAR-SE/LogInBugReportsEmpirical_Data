[Uploading patch (fix +UT), could you make the check case insensitive.  It has bitten people in the past: HIVE-11883, [~ekoifman]  .. it is already case insensitive ..
{code}
if (transactionalProp != null && transactionalProp.equalsIgnoreCase("true")) {
{code}, I mean "TRANSACTIONAL" vs "transactional"

also, it may be worth using hive_metastoreConstants.TABLE_IS_TRANSACTIONAL, It seems strange to make the lookup key case insensitive. i don't think maps support case insensitive lookups. the only option would be to iterate.. is that what you are suggesting ?

I could switch to using the constant but that wont make it case insensitive., its better to make the normalize the case of in the code that sets the tblproperties() on table .. to either lower or uppercase .. instead of every lookup trying to do a case-insenstive lookup on the map, yes, iterate.
the 2 are separate issues, sure, you can do it on tblproperties(), doing it in tblproperties would not be in scope of this jira.. my point is its better to it there instead of here or other places where lookup is done.  it defeats the purpose of using a Map<> , i am revising this patch to exclude the -w option, holding off this patch till HIVE-11983 is done, [~ekoifman] .. patch is ready for review, +1 pending tests,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12764688 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ekoifman] I dont think any of these failures are related to the patch., [~roshan_naik], they are caused precisely by your changes.  This btw, also implies that it produce a better error message so that users have some idea why the table is not valid., Was misled to thinking it was unrelated due to all the tests being a different module.

Looks like the TestCompactor* test are related, but as best as i can tell these two are not
- TestHCatClient.testTableSchemaPropagation and 
- TestSSL.testSSLVersion


*WRT error message:*  The actual Logs emitted are unfortunately getting swallowed in the UT run. Only stack trace shown and Exception's internal string which is not sufficiently descriptive. The  LOG.error and  LOG.warn are quite clear in checkEndPoint().  

Will upload new patch to improve the message string in the exception and also fixed the TestCompactor tests

, uploading patch v3,
