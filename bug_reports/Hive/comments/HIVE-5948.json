2014843718, I understand the expected dir name (ie behavior with MR) is of the form "000000_0" , ie the task id.

Can you also add a comment to the setupMRLegacyConfigs function explaining why those configs are being set.

It will also be good to have a unit test for this, you can take a look at ql/src/test/queries/clientpositive/insert_overwrite_local_directory_1.q
{code}
insert overwrite local directory '../../data/files/local_src_table_1'
select * from src ;
dfs -cat ../../data/files/local_src_table_1/000000_0;
{code}

You need to add the query file name to itests/qtest/pom.xml under  <minitez.query.files> .
To generate the benchmark output file, run
mvn test -Dtest=TestMiniTezCliDriver -Dqfile=<new test file>.q -Phadoop-2

, the core changes in the patch look good to me., [~thejas] New patch attached with unit tests., +1, I have committed the patch to tez branch. I added a comment to the function, before committing (HIVE-5948.3.patch).

Thanks for your contribution Hitesh! Looking forward to more contributions! :)
