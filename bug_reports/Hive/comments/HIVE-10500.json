[This patch makes a couple of changes:
# It adds resets of deadlock count when a transaction is opened or a lock is requested.  This wasn't done before which means we may have been building up deadlock counts over several different users.
# It adds a short sleep when a deadlock is detected so that we don't jump right back into the deadlock., [~ekoifman], could you review this?

[~sushanth], I'd like to get this on the 1.2 branch.  Can I commit this or would you like me to wait until after you've rolled an RC?, Approved for 1.2, added to https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+1.2+Release+Status

You can go ahead and commit this to 1.2 when you commit it to trunk.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12728482 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, would "LOG.warn("Deadlock detected in " + caller + ", trying again.");" flood the log on a busy system?
perhaps this should be info or every Nth occurence, [~ekoifman], I didn't change the log level as that was already that way.  This patch doesn't make it worse.  If we find it to be a problem we can change it separately., I committed the patch to 1.2 branch and trunk., If the trunk commit is 8981f365bf0cf921bc0ac2ff8914df44ca2f7de7 then it has a typo in the JIRA number:  "HIVE-10050 Added backoff for deadlock retry. Also make sure to reset the deadlock counter at appropriate points.", Yes, I transposed two numbers in the commit message.  I looked at how to fix it but according to the documentation I read doing a 'git amend' would actually change the hash of the commit, which looked likely to do more damage than it fixed., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
