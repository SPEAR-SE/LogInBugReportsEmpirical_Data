[add success=true in the codes., Can we create a unit test around this? Hooks should print during testing and then we have some coverage here., the default hook is HBaseStorageHandler, it will be cover these codes when create hbase table. 
so i think we already have some unit test about hbase table in hive. 
it doesn't need to create unit test.
if we need more test case, i will create it. , I will review., +1 will commit., Committed. Thanks., Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1477 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1477/])
