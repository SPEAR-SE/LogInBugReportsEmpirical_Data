[Modified all places to use user-specified directory.

This will do the job:
{code}
ant test -Dbuild.dir.hive=abc
{code}


Note that the derby directory is still in build. There is no easy way to change that because derby does not do variable substitution in conf.

will commit if the tests pass, TestMTQueries is failing - can you take a look ?, The reason why this error is getting triggered is because previously diff would ignore lines that contained /tmp/. Now that we are using a user specified directory, that line doesn't get ignored anymore.

Normally, lines that begin with 'file:/' get ignored anyway, but in groupby1.q, we do:

{code}
set fs.default.name=invalidscheme:///;

EXPLAIN
FROM src INSERT OVERWRITE TABLE dest_g1 SELECT src.key, sum(substr(src.value,5)) GROUP BY src.key;
{code}

The issue with this test is that the log file will contain invalidscheme:/<user's directory> and he user's directory will always trip up the test., Thanks for the analysis Paul!
I will modify the diff command to ignore the lines starting with "invalidscheme".
, It turns out that I have to pass the parameters down to the jvm that is spawned from MapRedTask.

Note that the variables in hive-site.xml are expanded by referencing to Java System Properties (the properties passed by "-D" to jvm, or by "sysproperty" directive in build-comon.xml junit test).

, Committed. Thanks Zheng, Committed in 0.5 also]
