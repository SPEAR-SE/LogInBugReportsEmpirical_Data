[I think we we are skipping the init, we should skip all the initQueries, as I see all of them serving the same purpose.

, The whole initialization done via ObjectStore.setConf also needs to be re-examined. But that can be a follow up jira.
, It makes sense to make all these init calls in test only., [~t3rmin4t0r] can you take a look?, LGTM - +1
, The init query regressed when the BTree on PART_COL_STATS went from (DB_NAME ...) -> (CAT_NAME, DB_NAME)

The test query went from 3ms -> 4.5 seconds. After this fix, it has improved to 0ms :)

, Again because HiveQA is dumb., [~vihangk1] I'd like to commit this to 3.0 since this is otherwise a major regression. Does this make sense?, [~vgarg]: trivial patch to include for 3.x , +1 for branch-3, Committed to master for now, Committed also to branch-3. Thanks!, guess you meant Vineet [~sershe] :) , [~vihangk1] I saw your name on top of the 3.0 thread on dev@ and assumed you are the RM :), [~sershe] this patch has failed the following tests in branch-3:

* org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.TestStats.partitionedTableInHiveCatalog
* org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.TestStats.partitionedTableDeprecatedCalls
* org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.TestOldSchema.testPartitionOps

I am reverting this commit from branch-3 for now. Please fix theses tests for branch-3 to get this patch in.
 

Â , You can findi TestReport at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/10766/testReport/, Fixed the tests and reverted the revert. Generally if any tests fail like that they should be fixable by adding the flag. 
I cannot run TestStats locally (not sure why, maven just doesn't run it), but I can repro TestOldSchema issue and then verify the fix., Instead of reverting can you open a separate bug to fix? This is a blocker and if you just remove the version it's no longer tracked as blocker for 3.0, This jira is resolved and released with Hive 3.0 If you find an issue with it, please create a new jira.]
