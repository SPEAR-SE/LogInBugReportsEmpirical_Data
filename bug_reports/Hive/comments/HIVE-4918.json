[I am sure you realized this but,

{code}
+  private static Path createHashTables(MapWork mapWork, Configuration conf) {
+    return null;
+  }
{code}

I did not look into this much but could there must already be a method in hive for this?
{code}
+      Path scratchDir = DagUtils.createScratchDir(conf, ctx);
{code}, Thanks Ed. The createHashTables still has to be built. I need to find the right code in hive for this.

Let me also look into "createScratchDir". You're right. Hive should do this already., Renaming patch to ".txt"., Replaced the createScratchDir method with an existing one. Added comments for classes + methods., I will open additional jiras for hashtables and jar file localization., Committed to tez branch.]
