[reappear this problem on hive 2.0.0, i will dig it, I'm sorry, I can't upgrade Hive now to recheck the issue.
When we make an upgrade, I'll of course retry the query. But maybe you will find time earlier., sorry
i mean i have reappeared this problem on hive 2.0.0, The bug comes from constantfolding. equalns extends equal, but equal has a negative function of notequal. As a result, equalns also inherits notequal as the negative function. , [~ashutoshc],could u please review it? Thanks., +1,
