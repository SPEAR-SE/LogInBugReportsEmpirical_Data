ATTACHMENT ID: 12753007 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to master and branch-1. Thanks Aihua., [~csun], your commit does not include the JIRA number (although it has the same title so the issue is easy to find).  I'll add it to the errata list in the thread "Please double-check JIRA number on commit" on dev@hive.
