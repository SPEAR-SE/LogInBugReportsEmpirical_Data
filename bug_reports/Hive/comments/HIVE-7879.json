, Hive, will command "group by" explain to division method? or count(*)?

I don't use any division ,but why error "/ by zero" ?, I have resolve it.

It because my disk has no space, sometimes the disk clean and have a little space for job, it become sucess, and other times the disk has not enough space, so it become error.

But, why it show '/ by zero' when disk is full? will  the jobs distribution use division? This need someone other to explain it.]
