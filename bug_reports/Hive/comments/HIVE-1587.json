[This might not be the problem but looking at why this happends I noticed the delete used to happen on ExecDriver.execute but seems to have moved to ctx.clear() which is now only executed when the Context was removed.
Is it correct the Driver remains alive for the duration of a connection (when using HiveServer)? Since we use connection pooling to connect to the hive server it means some connections never really close so that would explian what I'm seeing.

        emptyScratchDir.getFileSystem(job).delete(emptyScratchDir, true);
        if (returnVal != 0 && rj != null) {
          rj.killJob();
        }
        runningJobKillURIs.remove(rj.getJobID());
      } catch (Exception e) {
      }
    }

          ctx.clear();

        if (returnVal != 0 && rj != null) {
          rj.killJob();
        }
        runningJobKillURIs.remove(rj.getJobID());
      } catch (Exception e) {
      }
    }
, Any progress on this issue? I have this issue as well and it's causing quite a bit of space waist on our cluster., Is it an issue anymore for newer version (such as hive 0.10)? I was unable to recreate this.
