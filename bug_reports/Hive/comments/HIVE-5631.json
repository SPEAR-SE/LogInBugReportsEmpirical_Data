This message is automatically generated., org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_index_creation
This test failed because SerDeInfo object is not initialized correctly in patch. Attached the updated patch.

org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_infer_bucket_sort_convert_join
The test failed in setup but I don't see any error info in logs. Also I am able to run it successfully on my machine.

org.apache.hcatalog.hbase.snapshot.lock.TestWriteLock.testRun
This seems to be a failure in starting the mini ZK server and doesn't look related to the change in this bug. Again this runs successfully on my machine.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12681441 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, authorization_index.q failure is related to the change. Will upload a new patch soon., you can just update .q.out file., Differences is .out files are:

{noformat}
< Num Buckets:        	0                   	 
---
> Num Buckets:        	-1                  	 
45a46,47
> Storage Desc Params:	 	 
> 	serialization.format	1
{noformat}

Second difference "Storage Desc Params" is due to deepcopying of parent table StorageDescriptor and not resetting in copied version. First difference is also due to deepcopying. However all tables that are not bucketized contain the "-1" as the value for "Num Buckets". I am wondering whether we should keep the same default value for index tables too., Hmm.. yeah it make sense to have same default values.,
