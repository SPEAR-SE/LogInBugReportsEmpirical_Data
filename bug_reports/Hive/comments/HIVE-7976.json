, Merged to trunk. Thanks [~gopalv], [~sseth], [~sershe], [~rajesh.balamohan], [~prasanth_j] and [~vikram.dixit]!, See HIVE-7826 comment about parameter typo:  *hive.tez.dynamic.parition.pruning.max.data.size* (parition).

* [HIVE-7826 comment | https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7826?focusedCommentId=14125109&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14125109], Does this need any user or administrator documentation, other than the three parameters for dynamic partition pruning?  Should the design doc be updated?

* [design doc:  Hive on Tez | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+on+Tez], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
