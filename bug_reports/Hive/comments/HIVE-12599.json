[After looking at it for a while I cannot quite understand how it happens... Will add better logging for exceptions. Is there a repro?, [~sseth] can you take a look at the logging patch?, 

Here are the results of testing the latest attachment:

ATTACHMENT ID: 12776211 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch for logging looks good to me. +1 if you think there's enough information to help narrow this down.

This could be unrelated - but saw this error twice, both times using the LRFU policy. Did not see it again after moving to FIFO., Committed.]
