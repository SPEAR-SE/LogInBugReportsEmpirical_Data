[I'm not able to reproduce the issue. But I tried to make the task fail if the output file already exists. And speculative task fails as expected, which means it's possible that speculative tasks write to the same file as original tasks and corrupt the results. Therefore I think we should append the real attempt ID for each task, if that doesn't cause too much trouble.
Meanwhile we still need a way to verify the root cause of the issue. Any ideas?, Trigger tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12788963 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~lirui], thanks for working on this. The change seems easy to understand. However, the original comment above the line you changed seems a little concerning. Do you think if there is any problem if attempt number is global to the Spark context? Were you able to reproduce the issue? If all is good, we might want to update the comment to reflect what actually happens. Thanks., I'm not sure what specific problem the comments are referring to. But I run the tests several times locally and there's no diff in test outputs. Pinging [~chengxiang li] for further comment.
bq. Were you able to reproduce the issue?
Unfortunately no. What I verified is that if we use 0 as attempt ID for speculative tasks, they'll write to the same file as original tasks. But somehow I still get correct results.,
