[patch attached.

The test case has also been modified to reflect this bug., submitting., +1, Committed revision 732157. Thanks Ashish!, This patch changed the log4j properties file from:
hive.root.logger=WARN,DRFA
to
hive.root.logger=DEBUG,console

Was this intentional? It gives a whole lot of hadoop debugging output when starting up the shell?, The patch file does not have that change..

Zheng, was this due to some debugging during test running?]
