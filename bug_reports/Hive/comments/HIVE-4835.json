[I agree. Metrics is best effort, throwing exceptions from it is not best of the ideas. 
CC'ing [~sushanth] who originally authored this class., Agreed, that should make a lot of the metrics calls simpler, and will clean up calling code., I think the method should return at-least return a boolean on whether an increment succeeded, so a corresponding decrement can be avoided if the increment failed. An incr might succeed but a decr fail, but that's again best effort to be consistent., [~thiruvel] Makes sense, that way the caller could handle failure if it prefers to, but is not forced to.]
