[One way to fix this is to set higher threshold for failures. Higher threshold can easily be reached on bigger clusters. If the threshold is set to 20, then 2 failures on 10 nodes will bring down all daemons. Ideally, we want slider to retry failures on a different node., for now setting it to infinite failures as some nodes can be good and few failures will not bring down good nodes that could be actually running queries. , [~sseth] could you please take a look? small patch, [~prasanth_j] - I don't think we make a permanent change of this being set to 0. A bad instance will never stop on it's own, and will keep trying to launch new containers.
A better default would likely be numInstances, while making sure it is not too low (6 is the default for example), and the value is high enough to allow a node to be blacklisted.
Option1: numInstances * threshold to mark a node as disabled.
Option2: max(6, max(numInstances, threshold to mark a node as disabled))
Option3: ?

An enhancement request to Slider to get better control over this ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12873767 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, This sounds like a Slider issue. It should be able to tell apart flaky nodes from flaky components, at least statistically. cc [~gsaha], [~sershe] [~prasanth_j] probably makes sense for one of you to create a YARN ticket and link here. I assume failures like this would happen for, e.g. node with full disk so doesn't seem like a far fetched edge case,

{code}, [~sershe] can you take a look?
cc/ [~gsaha], +1. Looks good to me., This patch will not affect any tests. Just adds some command line options to llap service.  No ptest is required. 

Committed to branch-2 and master. Thanks for the review!
, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
