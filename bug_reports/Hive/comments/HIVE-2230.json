[Perhaps related to HIVE-1526 where we switched to thrift 0.5.0? The wiki still seems to claim you need "Thrift trunk version r790732", I talked with Dmytro offline and this line on the wiki should probably changed:
"The Hive ODBC driver was developed with Thrift trunk version r790732, but the latest revision should also be fine."

Hive 0.7 and higher uses thrift 0.5.0. I'm not sure what happens when you mix with a newer version of thrift but the older version (r790732) doesn't seem to work. I would probably advice others to use 0.5.0.
