[Initial patch. [~owen.omalley]/[~hagleitn] can you please take a look at it?, This is related to HIVE-4177. But this patch uses the same code for partialscan and noscan., [~prasanth_j] this sounds like a bad idea, because it has the potential of masking random errors. Can't you do a check for types (or avoid having types that don't match altogether?), [~hagleitn] i agree that it will mask other errors too.. adding checks for valid types is also error prone..
instead of checking for different valid types for comparison.. how about just looking for ClassCastException and just ignore it i.e, select that particular row group..?, [~hagleitn] selection row group is our best effort to choose row groups based on predicates.. so it shouldn't throw in any case.. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12633017, Addressed [~hagleitn] initial review comments., attaching RB link, minor comment on RB. Does any test (I just skimmed them) actually test the new path w/exception?, Yes. testPredEvalWithDateStats() has some invalid cases that should throw., Earlier patch had issues with Date conversions. Fixed them in this patch., Patch version was wrong. Reuploading again., lgtm, (as in, +1), Reuploading patch for precommit tests.,
