[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1359


Will add a test for this after the above jira is fixed, because this can only be reproduced with CombineHiveInputFormat, where all 
hadoop 17 tests will break., Have verified the fix in a production hadoop 20 cluster, Is it possible the value object of different files are also different? If not shouldn't the value parameter in initNextRecordReader() be removed?, I dont know if the value can be different.
But, to be sure, I will change the Value also, I meant, I will remove the value from initNextRecordReader(), +1. will commit if tests pass. , committed. Thanks Namit!]
