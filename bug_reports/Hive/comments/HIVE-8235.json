[Application logs, Sorted tables aren't yet supported by ACID.  So there are a couple of things here:
# We need to file a bug for ACID to check up front if a table is sorted and if so give a good error message rather than ship wreck at runtime.
# See if the behavior described in this bug can be reproduced on a non-sorted table., [~mmokhtar] can you try to rerun this now that HIVE-8290 has been committed?, [~alangates]
Sure, ill give it a go., [~mmokhtar], ping, have you had a chance to run this?  I can't reproduce it., Closing as cannot reproduce, as I cannot reproduce this.  Please re-open if you see it again., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
