* [Configuration Properties -- HiveServer2 | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-HiveServer2], [~leftylev] Nope, this won't need documentation. It's a bug fix., Thanks, [~vgumashta]., Committed to 14., Hi, this breaks compilation with hadoop-1 (see HIVE-8324) via the reference to KerberosName.  Do you guys think its possible to fix this for 0.14?, While reviewing the patch, I had checked for KerberosName in hadoop-1, and verified that is is a public class. I should have tried actually compiling it! It turns out that KerberosName is in a different package in hadoop-1.

[~vgumashta] Will you be able to take a look at HIVE-8324 ? If not I can look into it.
, Thanks for following up on this [~szehon]!, [~szehon] I'll take care of HIVE-8324 in next few days. Thanks for filing the issue. , No problem, thanks guys., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
