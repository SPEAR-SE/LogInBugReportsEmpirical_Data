[Hive metastore "SERDE_PARAMS.PARAM_VALUE" column limits to [varchar 4000|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/metastore/scripts/upgrade/mysql/hive-schema-0.14.0.mysql.sql#L455], I got the same error for a an external table with 185 columns. , In fact the limit was not on the number of columns but on the number of characters in 
SERDEPROPERTIES("hbase.columns.mapping"= "a field that has maximum 4000 characters").

So this bug is due to the error: ERROR: value too long for type character varying(4000)
workaround: https://support.pivotal.io/hc/en-us/articles/203422043-ERROR-value-too-long-for-type-character-varying-4000-




, Getting the same error for an external table with 250+ columns.
Any help ?, HIVE-9815Â and HIVE-12274 are also addressing this issue., I was facing the same issue. It was resolved by doing following changes in hive meta store.

-- log into Hive Metastore DB

-- >alter table SERDE_PARAMS MODIFY PARAM_VALUE VARCHAR(400000000);
