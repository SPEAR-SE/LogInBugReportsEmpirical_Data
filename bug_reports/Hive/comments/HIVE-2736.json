[Philip,
Welcome to awesome world of FOSS. Go ahead, create a patch and submit it. Someone, will take a look. I have assigned the jira to you as well., @Philip,
Patch looks good. Can you add a test case for it? You may find this howto useful : https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-AddaUnitTest , @Ashutosh - I've added a tiny test query as well. It throws an exception on the unpatched codebase. Let me know if it's sufficient, or if I should write a proper unit test., Unlinking from 0.9, +1 will commit if tests pass., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Philip!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #54 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/54/])
