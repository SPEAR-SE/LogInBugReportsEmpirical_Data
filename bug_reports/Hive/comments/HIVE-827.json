[For posterity, why does the value of 10,000 lead to bad performance?, What I meant to say is that there is enough memory on the machines to fit more than 10,000 rows easily - of course, that depends on the row size.
But, based on the mails in the mailing lists, I felt that, a higher default may be better, It is actually backed my persistent disk, so there is no correctness issue, but most of the applications may be able to use a higher default value, +1. Will commit if tests pass., Committed. Thanks Namit!]
