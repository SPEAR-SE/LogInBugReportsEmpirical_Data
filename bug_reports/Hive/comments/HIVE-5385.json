[When I compile hive with "ant clean package -Dhadoop.version=0.20.2 -Dhadoop.mr.rev=20", I can see both "commons-codec-1.4.jar" and "commons-codec-1.6.jar" in "build/dist/lib". 
, We should update 0.20 shim to use 1.4, Hi, I've created a patch for this issue and confirmed to build successfully., [~k.saruta] Thanks for the patch. Actually, right now, codec 1.4 will not be downloaded to build/ivy/lib/hadoop0.20.shim/. So, the issue in eclipse seems will not be addressed.

[~ashutoshc] Should we just change the eclipse classpath to point to "/build/ivy/lib/default" or need to change the "ivy.xml" of shims to explicitly add codec 1.4 as a dependency of 0.20 shim? 
 , [~yhuai] Sorry, I had a mistake.
I found why commons-codec 1.3 is downloaded is because hadoop-core(0.20.2) depends on commons-codec 1.3.
So, if we use commons-codec 1.4, we should use newer hadoop-core ( maybe 0.20.205 or 1.x) for hadoop-core., [~sarutak] right, that's the reason. Seems we still need to support 0.20.2 for a while. So, can you modify ivy.xml of shims to exclude 1.3 codec and to add 1.4 codec as a dependency? Then, you can check if 1.4 jar is placed in build/ivy/lib/hadoop0.20.shim/. Thanks :), I hit the same issue yesterday and I added a new entry in eclipse-template/.classpath for commons-codec-1.4 from build/ivy/lib/default. Since hadoop-0.20.2 shims needs commons-codec-1.3 I added 1.4 as a separate classpath entry. That seemed to work fine for me., Even after adding commons-codec to classpath. Eclipse will report errors related to vector aggregate expression. We might need to add the generated vector aggregate code to source to avoid eclipse reporting errors. , [~yhuai] I think we should still keep 0.20.2 because there a little bit of problem of compatibility between 0.20.2 and 0.20.205+ ( e.g. UnixUserGroupInformation is no longer used in 0.20.205).
OK, I'll try to remove dependency of 1.3., I've attached a 2nd patch for this issue.,
