  DPAL-1003 Remove filter operator of which all the predicates have pushed down to storage handler

  If all the predicates have pushed down to StorageHandler in TS, it should be removed (or make empty). Might it be intentional?

Tip: use the X-Herald-Rules header to filter Herald messages in your client.
, Thanks Navis for tracking this down. We should remove filter altogether once its been pushed. I am guessing this may result in  changes in query plan in other *.q.out files in hbase tests, though test output itself must not change. Can you check that and update the patch if thats the case., After removing filter operator additional rows are found in result, which was caused by HIVE-2903. It should be fixed first., navis updated the revision "HIVE-2897 [jira] Remove filter operator of which all the predicates have pushed down to storage handler".
