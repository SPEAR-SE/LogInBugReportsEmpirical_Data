[Namit,

 While we can read the config variable "hive.exec.pre.hooks", parse it and prune specific entries from it (hard-coded? driven by yet another config?) on entry to createSources in QTestUtil, and then restore the original value before exit from createSources, there are two other possibilities apart from the temporary config entry method I went with in the original patch.

1. Use the sessionstate instance to record that we are in initialization phase. The rest of the code including hooks can make use of this (since they all have access to the thread-local object) in any which way they want.
2. Add specific methods to the Driver to inform that we are in test initialization phase. The driver can use this info to prune the hooks invoked (all/specific? again another config?)

I myself prefer the temporary config method or the sessionstate method, since it gives the freedom to shape the behavior of the system in the future during test initialization - for instance to avoid authentication checks, concurrency lock acquisitions at al. 

Your thoughts?
