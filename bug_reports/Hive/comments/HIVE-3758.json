{code}
ant clean package -Dhadoop-0.20S.version=1.0.4

{code}
[hduser@hdmaster trunk]$ ant clean package -Dhadoop-0.20S.version=1.0.4
Buildfile: build.xml

clean:
     [echo] Project: hive

clean:
     [echo] Project: anttasks
   [delete] Deleting directory....
...

...

compile:
     [echo] anttasks
    [javac] Compiling 3 source files to /workspace/other/org/hive/trunk/build/anttasks/classes
