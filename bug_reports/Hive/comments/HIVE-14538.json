[The bug is introduced by support of variable substitution.
There are some issues:
1. Variable substitution is not supported in beeline, so the problematic code could be avoided and the performance can be better.
2.  The NPE is caused by the code assume there is a valid connection between client and server
3.  ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException is caused by unexpected value. Boundary check is needed.

Attach patch to solve up issues., Need code review.,

[~spena], could you review the change? Thanks, A couple of nits:
1. while (rows != null && rows.hasNext()) -- could the rows != null be just checked one time instead in the loop?
2. could variable name connbl be changed to some more meaningful name such as dbconn etc? or why not directly use beeline.getConnection method, so if the connection is not available, there will be exception, or you think that sh still runs without a conneciton?
3. do you know why is substituteVariables currently only applicable to Beeline?
, Thanks [~ctang.ma] for the comments. 
1. I will change the code.
2. I need to run without a connection, for it is just a shell call, and let it succeed is what the customer wants. I will change the variable to dbconn. 
3. substitute does not work for beeline, hive does not support it because client should not control server's variable. So it is no point to run the parameter code when later the method is just ignored.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12826076 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, The failures are not related. [~ctang.ma], could you review the new patch? Thanks, The patch looks good. I wonder if the following code has the indention issue? 
{code}
+      if (dbconn != null)
+        conn = dbconn.getConnection();
+      if (conn != null) {     //should there be two spaces indention?
+        if (call) {
+          stmnt = conn.prepareCall("set");
+          hasResults = ((CallableStatement) stmnt).execute();
+        } else {
+          stmnt = beeLine.createStatement();
+          hasResults = stmnt.execute("set");
+        }
{code}
Also regarding your comment about that the variableSubstitution, can not following happen at the Beeline (client site) and the value does not have to be the server value.
set variableX = valueX
select * from tbl where col1 = $variableX
I am just curious. The question is actually beyond the scope of the patch, [~ctang.ma], there is no indention issue, following is the code:
{noformat}
  private Map<String, String> getHiveVariables() {
    Map<String, String> result = new HashMap<>();
    BufferedRows rows = getConfInternal(true);
    if (rows != null) {
      while (rows.hasNext()) {
        Rows.Row row = (Rows.Row) rows.next();
        if (!row.isMeta) {
          result.put(row.values[0], row.values[1]);
        }
      }
    }
    return result;
  }

For the variables for shell commands:
Following is some comment in the review board of:

Yeah. It's a little trickier than thought. Shell command is executed at client side (Beeline) and it doesn't seem making sense to use server specific variables such (env, sys, hiveconf, hivevar) in the shell commands. More importantly, Beeline can connect to multiple serves at the same time, so which configurations should be used to substitue the variables? User should be able to execute shell commands w/o any server connection.

For CLI, server and client are together, so these don't matter. But for beeline + HS2 deployment, story will be different.

I don't know what's the best, and all I'm saying is that we need to be very careful on what we doing. Before we decide what to do, we need to clearly define the problem we are trying to solve first., +1, Committed to the master. Thanks Chaoyu to review the code., Added a patch for branch 2.1]
