ATTACHMENT ID: 12889553 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, The test failures are not related to this change.

Please can I get a review from one of the maintainers of CompactionTxnHandler? I see [~alangates] [~ekoifman] [~wzheng] 

There is a [review board review here|https://reviews.apache.org/r/62693/]

Thanks, Why is it better to use PreparedStatements in cases where the query is only executed once?  I buy it if you're preparing them and then storing them in a static cache somewhere, but since you're preparing them every time you run the query I don't see the advantage.

In CompactionTxnHandler, I don't think you want to remove the quoteString calls.  Those are to make it so that table or column names that are a keyword or contain spaces, etc. still work.  I don't think the PreparedStatement solves that.

Why the changes to CompactionTxnHandler but not TxnHandler?

, Thanks [~alangates] for looking at the change

{quote}Why is it better to use PreparedStatements in cases where the query is only executed once? I buy it if you're preparing them and then storing them in a static cache somewhere, but since you're preparing them every time you run the query I don't see the advantage.{quote}
On a RDBMS like Oracle the optimization happens at prepare time. The query plan is cached and is reused then next time the same query is prepared. So there is some small perf advantage to using PreparedStatement.

I did leave the quoteString calls around table names, I think I only removed the calls around parameters, which I believe is safe, another benefit of PreparedStatements.

{quote}Why the changes to CompactionTxnHandler but not TxnHandler?{quote}
I had to start somewhere :-)
, Do the reviewers need any other information? [~alangates] [~ekoifman] [~wzheng] , Assuming original reviewers are happy, can I maybe get a review from [~stakiar] or [~vihangk1] ?, [~asherman] can you create an RB for this? There seem to be some logic changes in addition to the migration to {{PreparedStatement}} - whats the nature of these changes?, There is already a [review board review here|https://reviews.apache.org/r/62693/]
There should be no logic changes.,
