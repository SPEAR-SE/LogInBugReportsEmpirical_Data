[[~thejas] could you review please, How about going to back to the original goal of SecureProxySupport - " it's a noop if security is not enabled." (as mentioned in the description).

Ie, moving args.add("proxy.user.name=" + user); back under if(isEnabled)

Also, can you run the code you have added/modified through the IDE formatter ? There are a few nits like " <=0" which when properly formatted would be " <= 0" (space after operator).
, HADOOP_USER_NAME takes care of everything under unsecure mode, so in unsecure mode, we don't need proxy.user.name.
, +1, [~hagleitn], this is a followup to HIVE-8643 which is needed in 0.14 as well, +1 for hive .14, patch 2 and 3 are the same - just trying to kick off build bot,
