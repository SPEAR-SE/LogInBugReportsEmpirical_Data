Review request for hive, Yongqiang He and namit jain.


Summary
-------

now when CommandNeedRetryException is thrown, locks are not released. Not sure whether it will cause problem, since the same locks will be acquired when retrying it. It is anyway something we need to fix. Also we can do some little code cleaning up to make future mistakes less likely.


This addresses bug HIVE-2123.

    There's a try/catch block here, so why not do this the Java way and throw an exception instead of returning a status code?

    Can you replace this with a DriverException class?

    I tried to make some minimum change, but it looks much more difficult than I thought. The whole structure is built based on return codes, instead of exceptions. What I can do is that I can make Driver.run() not to throw any exception. In that case, we don't get two approaches twisted.

, I changed Driver.execute() not to throw any exception. CommandNeedRetryException is translated to another return status code in this level.,

Thanks,

, @Carl?, @Siying: Thanks for making the change.

+1 on this patch, but I'm -1 on the overall approach of using status return codes instead of exceptions. Hopefully we can replace the status codes with exceptions during some future cleanup effort., looks good to me. will commit after tests pass., Siying, can you rebase the patch. I got some small conflict when trying to commit., rebase, Siying, HIVE-2123.3.patch can not pass compilation. And HIVE-2123.4.patch does not have apache license granted. , License granted. 

, This one has been sitting in Patch Available queue for a while...anything holding it up?
, @Siying: Can you please rebase the patch?]
