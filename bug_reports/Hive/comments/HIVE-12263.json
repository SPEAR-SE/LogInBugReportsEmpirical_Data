ATTACHMENT ID: 12768651 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi Ashutosh Chauhan,
Thanks for your review, I went through the failed UTs, that's not related to this fix, so could you please help commit this fix into trunk build? Thanks! Any further information just feel free to let me know., Pushed to master. Thanks, Chen!, Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug.]
