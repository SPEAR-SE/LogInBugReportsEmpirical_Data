ATTACHMENT ID: 12726312 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch looks good. Minor nit: The condition for nextKeyGroup should be an else block.

Some other considerations:

- Maybe we should log emit and spill intervals. Also warn if the first is > than latter?
- Looks like you emit before you put the current record into storage. Wouldn't it be better to do that afterwards?

Biggest concern: There's not a lot of testing going on. For one thing I think you could set the emit interval low (2?) for all tez tests and see if you get bigger coverage that way. If not you should test all the combinations: left, right, outer, multi key, multi table, spill other tables, etc.,
