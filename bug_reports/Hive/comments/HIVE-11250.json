[In addition to the problem, I think changing value of hive.execution.engine from spark to others (say, mr) should result in destroying the spark session. While this is probably not comment in a production environment, I ran into problem in testing that I switched to MR and found that the MR job doesn't make any progress because all containers are currently held by the spark session., The change is not taken effect since HS2 clones the HiveConf but missed the spark conf updated flag.

The attached patch fixed the HiveConf clone issue, couple typos. The spark session is also closed when the execution engine is changed not to spark, if the session is not null.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748861 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, The test didn't run because of disk space problem, possibly due to HIVE-11466, which I'm investigating. In the meantime, [~spena], could you clean up some disk space so that the test can go ahead?, Re-uploaded the patch., I made more space on Jenkins. You can try to run this test again., Thanks everyone. The patch is in the queue for test again.,
