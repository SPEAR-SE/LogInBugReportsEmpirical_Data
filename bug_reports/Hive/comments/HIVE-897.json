[Prasad, do we have any details on this issue, We were looking at fixing this but the problem statement is very abstract., @Velu,
I don't remember details any more. I think the problem is that code expectes full URI in some cases (LoadSemanticAnalyzer) and relative URI in some cases. The metastore stores whatever is given to it so the metastore db can contain either full or relative depending on how the table is created. The purpose of this task to make the handling of 'location' parameter uniform throughout the code (hive.metastore, hive.ql.metastore & load & move related classes).

Feel free to take over as appropriate., Thanks Prasad, will look at this... ]
