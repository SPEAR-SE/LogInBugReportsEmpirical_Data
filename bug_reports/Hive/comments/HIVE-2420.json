[Amareshwari, can you help take a look?

there is .q file in the diff. and the query in that .q file should be converted to a sort merge join. But it is not, i think this is because after ppd, the partition pruner expr is not correctly populated. , Amareshwari, please feel free to reassign to me if u do not have time on it. Thanks!, Will not be able to look into it this week. Will try and do in the next week., This is pretty important. it will block us testing and deploying the open source trunk., Reassigning, as I may not get time this week too., i think a quick fix may be just revert the diff of dedup filters. what do u think?, If that is the case, we can as well set hive.ppd.remove.duplicatefilters to false., Yongqiang, didn't we already temporarily set that to false in our own config due to HIVE-2344?  That has since been fixed, but if there are other problems, we can keep it disabled until all are resolved.
, awesome, will first try the config setting. ]
