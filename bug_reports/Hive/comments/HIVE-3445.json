CREATE TABLE T1(key INT, val STRING) SKEWED BY (key) ON ((2));
CREATE TABLE T2(key STRING, val STRING) SKEWED BY (key) ON ((3)) STORED AS TEXTFILE;

EXPLAIN
SELECT a.*, b.* FROM T1 a JOIN T2 b ON a.key = b.key;


The join keys for the two tables are different.
Ideally, the skew join optimization would still work for this, since the udf converting the join keys has a 
one-one mapping. Instead of hard-coding this logic in SkewJoinOptimizer, it would be cleaner to create a new
annotation oneToOne, which would be valid for the type conversion udfs.
