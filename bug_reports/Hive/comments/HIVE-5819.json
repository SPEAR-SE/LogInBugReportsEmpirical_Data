[Good catch, and easily fixed.

Just before the "primitive_type" section CREATE TABLE also lists union_type with this cryptic message: 

bq.    union_type (Note: Only available starting with Hive 0.0) - needs documentation

so I'll link to [Union Types|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-UnionTypes] -- but which Hive version introduced them?
, Found the answer:  Hive 0.7.0 introduced UNIONTYPE (HIVE-537) and improvements are pending (HIVE-2390)., Done.  Added VARCHAR in the [Create Table|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTable] section and gave links to two Types docs after the syntax: 

bq.  See [Type System|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Tutorial#Tutorial-TypeSystem] and [Hive Data Types|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types] for details about the primitive and complex data types.

Also fixed the union_type description, and added links to both union type JIRAs in the Hive Data Types doc ([Union Types|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Types#LanguageManualTypes-UnionTypes]):

bq.  Union datatype was introduced in Hive 0.7.0 (HIVE-537). See HIVE-2390 for planned improvements.

(When HIVE-2390 is committed and released, I'll remove the word "planned".)]
