[When use  MapredLocal Task uses logging system defined file, but task fails before the defined file is created. The System.err has nowhere to direct. It should be helpful to let HS2 also log the error details. Attached the patch to add the log. , [~ychena] Looks like we are already printing the errors to the log file from HIVE-17078. Can you verify if that's the case?

      LogRedirector.redirect(
          Thread.currentThread().getName() + "-LocalTask-" + getName() + "-stdout",
          new LogRedirector(executor.getInputStream(), LOG, callback));
      LogRedirector.redirect(
          Thread.currentThread().getName() + "-LocalTask-" + getName() + "-stderr",
          new LogRedirector(executor.getErrorStream(), LOG, callback));
