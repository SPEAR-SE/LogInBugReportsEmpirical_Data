Hive 1.1.0-cdh5.4.3, I'm able to repro. I will look into that. Thanks for reporting., We cannot folder x <> 3 and x is not NULL to x <> 3 while other comparison operators can. Exclude <> operator from such optimization.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12748958 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Attached new patch. In this patch, we try to fold not() operator into the child operator and then do the following optimization regularly., Instead of negativeUDFMapping, other possibility is to use GenericUDF::flip() ?, Thanks. I was looking for such kind of function. That helps., [~ashutoshc]  I notice that GenericUDFOPEqualOrGreaterThan's flip() is GenericUDFOPEqualOrLessThan() rather than GenericUDFOPLessThan(). Also the same for the other ops. Do you know what the flip() here really meant to be? Is that a bug or intentional?, Yeah.. that seems like a bug to me.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12750897 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, I double checked the code. Seems flip() is meant to convert a >= b to b <= a, not meant to take the not() operator. I can add a new function to GenericUDF for that purpose then., I think adding a new function is better because any other udfs (including user udfs) can take advantage of this optimization, if they provide a valid not-udfs. 
Tangentially, I didn't look where flip() is used, but seems like flipping <= to >= won't be really useful. Were you able to determine whether  that was intentional? , Unit tests updated. A new negative() function is added for supported UDF function., Yeah. That's a good suggestion. Didn't think of user UDFs. I added a new function there now.

I notice there is only one place which calls flip(). The logic seems to convert constant >= x to x <= constant in IndexPredicateAnalyzer:analyzeExpr(). I'm not familiar with that class though., +1 pending tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12751274 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~ashutoshc] or [~csun] Can you help submit the patch? Thanks for reviewing the code, guys., Committed to master (it doesn't apply to branch-1, please let me know if you think it should). Thanks Ashutosh for the review., I think it will be good to push it to branch-1 as well since this has potential to generate incorrect results without any warning. [~aihuaxu] If you can generate branch-1 patch, that will be great., Seems we need to backport HIVE-11398 to branch-1 first before checkin this patch. Can you guys backport that first?, HIVE-11398 is a new performance enhancement feature, I am not sure whether its a good idea to backport such changes., If we can't backport that, then I need to regenerate the baselines for some tests. I will do that later., Attached the patch for branch-1 branch., This was backported to branch-1.2 (commit 300717b39428a7898e4228139fbb08ca5c425ca7) so the Fix Version/s should include 1.2.2.

I don't see any commit to branch-1 for the 1.3.0 release., Should this issue be backported to branch-1? It looks like a bug., Yeah. It should be backported to branch-1.]
