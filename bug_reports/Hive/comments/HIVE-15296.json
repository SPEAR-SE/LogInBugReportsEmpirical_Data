[[~prasanth_j] [~sseth]  [~hagleitn] fyi, fixing the NPE in the latest patch, er, wrong jira, Not 100% sure of the root cause.
1) The difference in heartbeat mechanisms before and after the task is running is actually irrelevant, since it is only present on LLAP side.
2) The tracking and killing itself is done by Tez AM. Unless there's a bug in Tez, which I cannot see in the code, it should work.

The problem must be in the part that connects these together. Upon examination, I wonder if having heartbeats from the node (host+port) blindly heartbeat all the tasks that AM *thinks* are on the node is the culrpit? The restarted LLAP can heartbeat in time. 
This patch propagates unique daemonId usage to node heartbeats (and submit task response, to know the original unique node ID for the task in the first place).
I left some TODO comments to improve the handling for this, but for now I'd rather not rewrite EntityTracker entirely to use unique ID everywhere.

[~sseth] [~prasanth_j] can you take a look?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12841541 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~gopalv] can you take a look? , The patch fixes an actual issue of in-place restarts, but I've left an RB comment about the possibility of a race condition on thi.uniqueid.

Commit with warnings/caveats on that - +1., Minor update,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12842074 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Committed to master. Thanks for the review!, [~sershe] - thanks for catching this and fixing it. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-15163 is related to a large extent. Didn't see the potential problem with the wait-queue unfortunately :(
The eventual plan was to have a custom NodeId possible in Tez, which can then be defined by LLAP (linked to the ZK registered nodeId). That's essentially why LlapNodeId differs from YARN NodeId, which is used all over the place in Tez. Think this fixes it nicely for now though.]
