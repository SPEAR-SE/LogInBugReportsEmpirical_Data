[All 4 issues are fixed in attached patch, Related discussion on SQL Workbench forum - https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/sql-workbench/YztqtDxmiBc, 3 of the fixes look good. 
However, in case of getUpdateCount, I am not sure if -1 is the better result, as  it means the current result is a ResultSet object or there are no more results. It can be interpreted as a failure in running an 'insert/update' query. SQL Workbench might be OK with -1 as result, but it is possible that other jdbc tools would report that as an error.

Statement.execute(sql) returns true or false 
true if the first result is a ResultSet object; false if it is an update count or there are no results
after that jdbc client should call  getResultSet or getUpdateCount

if execute() returns false and getUpdateCount returns -1 It means no result.  It is NORMAL execution result.  it is NOT an ERROR.

I's exactly what hive jdbc driver should return to client.   you run "insert into ...".  hive does not have facility to tell you update count.  Hive return you no result in response.  No result is normal result. It's not an error.

if there is an error, e.g. table does not exist then driver will throw SQL Exception
java.sql.SQLSyntaxErrorException: table or view does not exist

This is how jdbc client will get error message but not by getting -1 from getUpdateCount

Some databases including hive can not tell how many rows were inserted and they should return -1 in getUpdateCount but no to fool the user returning 0

When user gets all result from Statement then Statement object should be in final state. According to API spec
There are no more results when the following is true:

     // stmt is a Statement object
     ((stmt.getMoreResults() == false) && (stmt.getUpdateCount() == -1))
 

Even if database support getUpdateCount it should return some update count value only first time you call getUpdateCount
Second time you call it it will return -1 anyway. I tested it with oracle jdbc 12.1.0.1

Some jdbc clients keep to retrive result or update count from Statement until Statement gets into final state (false / -1)
e.g. SQL Workbench continue to call getUpdateCount() millions of times because HiveStatement never gets into final state   false/ -1

Final state of HiveStatement should be 
getMoreResults = false
getUpdateCount = -1

 I assume hive jdbc implementation is not going to return getUpdateCount=0 first time user calls it and then for consequent calls return getUpdateCount=-1

so, lets return  getUpdateCount=-1  for the fist and all other consequent calls, I tried to run "insert into ..." statement using fixed jdbc driver in
1. SquirreL SQL
2. SQL Workbench
3. DbVisualizer

All executed the statement successfully
, Thanks for the extensive research and experiments [~apivovarov] ! 
I spend some more time reading up on this. Returning -1 instead of 0 for getUpdateCount might be a better behavior. It does look like better behavior than what we have. But the more correct behavior (when statement.execute indicates it is not a ResultSet), seems to be returning 0 the first time and returning -1 in the subsequent calls. According to what I read, statements that don't update rows such as "create table" are expected to return 0.

This is would be easy to implement using another variable in HiveStatement.

Other related changes that could potentially be made along with this is -
* getMoreResults returning appropriate value instead of throwing exception (Returns value of stmtHandle.isHasResultSet() the first time it is called, then false for subsequent calls)
* getResultSet returning the ResultSet only the first time it is called


, [~navis] [~prasadm] Do you guys have any opinion on this ?

[~apivovarov] What to the other tools show as the number of rows updated if -1 is returned the first time ? Do they just not print it in that case ? I agree that returning 0 the first time still has the problem of potentially confusing users.

Note: DbVisualizer always increase warnings counter on empty result (e.g. for select .. where 1=0), so it's ok that is shows "1 warnings" on create/insert/drop statements

, [~thejas] have you looked at jdbc clients output with fixed jdbc driver. What you think? Looks like all of them work well with getUpdateCount always returning -1., Yes, I think we can proceed with returning -1. I had some discussions with [~julianhyde] as well, and it gives me more confidence that -1 should work.
Can you please look into the failed tests ?
, Thanks again for trying it out with multiple jdbc clients.
, A stackoverflow thread [What does it mean when Statement.executeUpdate returns -1?|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/12400985/what-does-it-mean-when-statement-executeupdate-returns-1] is basically supportive of the idea of returning -1. In particular this comment:

{quote}
UPDATE: While reading [Mark Rotteveel's answer|http://stackoverflow.com/a/12412073/521799], I tend to agree with him, assuming that -1 is the JDBC-compliant value for "unknown update counts". Even if this isn't documented on the relevant method's Javadoc, it's documented in the [JDBC specs, chapter 13.1.2.3 Returning Unknown or Multiple Results|http://download.oracle.com/otn-pub/jcp/jdbc-4_1-mrel-spec/jdbc4.1-fr-spec.pdf]. In this very case, it could be said that an IF .. INSERT .. statement will have an "unknown update count", as this statement isn't SQL-standard compliant anyway.
