[Will also need to remove hive/service/if/hive_service.thrift, any generated files still there ?
, [~thejas] I do see service/src/gen/thrift/*, [~thejas] plz review, [~baluchicken] Can you please review the files that were generated using  hive/service/if/hive_service.thrift as well ?
, In case of master branch, the files under service/src/gen/thrift/ are now being generated from hive_service,  as refactoring has moved those generated by TCLService.thrift (generated by HiveServer2 thrift code) has been moved to service-rpc package.


, [~thejas] plz review, +1 pending tests
