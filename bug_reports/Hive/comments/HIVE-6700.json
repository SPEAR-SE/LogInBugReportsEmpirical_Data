[Looks good, only question I have is whether the try block needs to enclose setting up Inputs in the ReduceProcessor.
{code}
  if(shuffleInputs.size() == 1){
        //no merging of inputs required
        kvsReader = (KeyValuesReader) shuffleInputs.get(0).getReader();
      }else {
        //get a sort merged input
        kvsReader = new InputMerger(shuffleInputs);
      }
{code}, LGTM +1 pending tests run., .2 addresses sid's comment. good point need to include more in the try block., Looks good. +1,
