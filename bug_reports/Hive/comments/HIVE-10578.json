    HIVE-10578 : update sql standard authorization configuration whitelist

----
, Also, here is the pull request for 1.patch - https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/34
, +1, [~sushanth] Please consider this for 1.2.0 . It is a simple change that just allows some of the new configs introduced in 1.2.0 release to be set when sql standard authorization is enabled. It is a very low risk, but useful change.
, Patch committed to master and 1.2 branch.
Thanks for the review Jason!
