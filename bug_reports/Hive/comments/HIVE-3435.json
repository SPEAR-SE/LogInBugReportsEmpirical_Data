[The problems are similar to HIVE-3413:

1. missing dependency
   hadoop-minicluster needs to be added to pdk/ivy.xml as well.
   In pdk/build.xml, the test target needs to depend on "init, setup, ivy-retrieve, ivy-retrieve-test", so that when running pdk tests directly, the pdk/ivy.xml dependency will be resolved firstly.

2. configuration files need to be added
   log4j.properties and hive-site.xml need to be added to get rid of the following warning nessage:

    [junit] 2012-08-28 18:13:01,668 WARN [main] conf.HiveConf (HiveConf.java:<clinit>(73)) - hive-site.xml not found on CLASSPATH
    [junit] 2012-08-28 19:05:20,679 WARN [main] conf.Configuration (Configuration.java:loadProperty(1621)) - file:/tmp/cloudera/hive_2012-08-28_19-05-17_531_4347419252405007581/-local-10002/jobconf.xml:an attempt to override final parameter: mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.retry.interval; Ignoring.
[junit] 2012-08-28 19:05:20,680 WARN [main] conf.Configuration (Configuration.java:loadProperty(1621)) - file:/tmp/cloudera/hive_2012-08-28_19-05-17_531_4347419252405007581/-local-10002/jobconf.xml:an attempt to override final parameter: mapreduce.job.end-notification.max.attempts; Ignoring.
   
    These configuration files also needs to be put in a place where both builtin tests and pdk tests could load(due to property overload, pdk/test-plugin/test/conf could not be loaded by pdk, my plan is to update the place to pdk/scripts/conf).

3. HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER needs to be set in pdk/scripts/build-plugin.xml
   If not set, testutils/hadoop would initialize it to be "INFO,console", which would print log4j warning message on the console, and is not expected., The command I am using to build/test hive on hadoop23 is:

$ant very-clean package -Dhadoop.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop-0.23.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop.mr.rev=23

$ant test -Dhadoop.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop-0.23.version=0.23.1 -Dhadoop.mr.rev=23 -Dtest.continue.on.failure=false

The second line will run test on hadoop23. We need to monitor both builtin tests passed and pdk tests passed., Review Request submitted at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D5187, +1. Will commit if tests pass., @Zhenxiao: I took another look at the patch and added some comments on phabricator. Please take a look. Thanks., 1. pdk PluginTest is triggered in two places, either by builtin Test, or by pdk Test.

2. On hadoop23, HIVE-3413 fixed pdk PluginTest when triggered by builtin Test, by adding missing dependencies in builtin/ivy.xml, adding configuration files, and creating configuration directory for testing in: ${pdk.script.dir}/../test-plugin/test/conf

3. On hadoop23, HIVE-3413 did fixed the pdk PluginTest when triggered by builtin Test, while, when triggered by pdk Test directly, it is still failing, due to missing dependency, incorrect configuration file, etc.

4. To fix pdk PluginTest when triggered by pdk Test. missing dependency is added to pdk/ivy.xml, the following error would happen if this dependency is not added:

java.io.IOException: Cannot initialize Cluster. Please check your configuration for mapreduce.framework.name and the correspond server addresses.

  HIVE-3413 already added the missing dependency in builtin/ivy.xml, while, if run pdk PluginTest in pdk Test, this dependency is not resolved, and the exception happened. We need to add this dependency so that when PluginTest is running by pdk, also resolve the dependency.

5. HIVE-3413 created a directory for test configuration at:
pdk/test-plugin/test/conf

builtin Test could successfully get these configuration files by putting the conf directory as HADOOP_CONF_DIR, while, pdk Test could not get these conf files. When running pdk test, the value of HADOOP_CONF_DIR(which is set by builtin Test) could not successfully get the configuration files. Actually, builtin Test and pdk Test could not share the same {pdk.test.conf.dir}, so they could not load the same configuration files to get passed.

builtin Test and pdk Test are sharing ${pdk.script.dir}, so I propose to delete the pdk/test-plugin/test/conf, and put configuration files in the newly created, pdk/scripts/conf, which could be read by both builtin Test and pdk Test., Updated patch submitted at:
https://reviews.facebook.net/D5187, Comments on phabricator. Thanks., @Carl:

Thanks for the comments. I updated the patch at:
