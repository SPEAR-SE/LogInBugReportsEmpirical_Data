[* Do we need to worry about other primitive types such as char/varchar/date/timestamp ? 
* You may use alltypesorc table as a test table which comes pre-populated with data for this test., Thanks Ashutosh!

Yes, it makes sense; I will add new test cases.

I was exploring the code and I could not really spot any reason for this implementation limitation. Any ideas?, Likely reason is these types were added to Hive after first support for windowing went in., Oh, alright. I will add support for other primitive types then and add test cases accordingly.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12808998 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Pushed to master, branch-2.1. Thanks for reviewing [~ashutoshc]!, Should this be documented in the wiki?  If so, please add a TODOC2.1 label.

* [Windowing and Analytics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+WindowingAndAnalytics], [~leftylev], it is not really necessary, in the wiki we mention we support primitive types; problem was that some primitive types were added to Hive after the windowing logic was added, so it should have been updated as it has been done now. Thanks, Okay, thanks.]
