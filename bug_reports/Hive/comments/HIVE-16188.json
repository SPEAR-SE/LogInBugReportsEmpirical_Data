ATTACHMENT ID: 12858630 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hello [~stakiar]
no worries., Hi [~stakiar] Thanks for the patch. Does this change the behavior with HiveCLI too? Also, would be good if we can add a test case for this., 1. I don't think you can specify/select the database to start the connection with Hive CLI.
2. Hive CLI is deprecated, use beeline shell going forward.
, Looks like there are some related test failures:

TestJdbcWithMiniHS2.org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcWithMiniHS2
TestJdbcDriver2.testSetOnConnection

Will fix those + will add some new tests.

[~pgarg_impala_3a7b] - the fix I am working on may be Hive specific (the fix requires a change to {{HiveSessionImpl}}). From your description  it seems you are trying to connect to Impala, correct? I'm not sure how Beeline connects to Impala so I'm not 100% if this change will work for Impala too., Hello [~stakiar]
Yes, In my case, I am trying to connect to impalaDaemon using beeline tool on port 21050
But your fix should work, because either way we are using Hive code to connect.
Hope that makes sense.
, Attaching updated patch:

* Fixed failing unit tests
* Added a new test that makes sure an exception is thrown when connecting to a database that does not exist,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12858772 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~vihangk1] any other comments?, I looked into code again and I think client side is better place to handle this validation than on the HiveServer2 side. In addition to this check in HiveSession I think we should also add this check in HiveDriver:parseURLforPropertyInfo() method. Since we know that connection request will fail there is no need to even attempt making a connection. What do you think [~stakiar]?, We could do it client side, but it would have to be after the connection is made. We have no way of knowing whether the database name exists or not without making a {{HiveConnection}} and querying the metastore to see if the database exists.

The only way I can think of doing it client side, would be to make the connection, and then execute a {{describe database [db-name]}} command. If the the query throws an exception, then it should exit. If it works then everything executes normally. , Agreed. Initially I mistook this JIRA for Db name validation for cases where db name after port number is not present Eg: {{-u jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000 -n hive}}. Please ignore my earlier comment. That patch looks good to me., [~spena] could you take a look at this patch?, The patch looks good. 
+1, [~spena], the current plan is for master to become release 3.0.0 so this issue's fix version should be 3.0.0 instead of 2.2.0.

* [About next 2.3 release | http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201703.mbox/%3cCAMs4YUe4Wn3ZABeet-aCN6sMHUp0k8ffgeu3W6m4Y9wgJFSPjg@mail.gmail.com%3e]

Please commit to branch-2 if you want this patch in 2.3.0, which is what we thought would be 2.2.0 but now that's going to be a special case:

* [Re: Backward incompatible changes | http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hive-dev/201703.mbox/%3cCAHfHakEL-+C=Q5rnruNxfcMqABnpm5M_H6QroKcrnS24cv2GxQ@mail.gmail.com%3e], Oh yes, sorry [~leftylev]. I was still used to type 2.2, > I was still used to type 2.2

Yeah, there's a lot of that going around.  ;), Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
