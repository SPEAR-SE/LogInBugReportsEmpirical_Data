[Since the parameter has been used for both types of security, for backward compatibility reasons, if old authorization interface is used, it will still be enabled if hive.security.authorization.enabled=true.
, I had wrong assumption about storage-based-authorization/metastore side authorization.
This config param hive.security.authorization.enabled is ignored by
the metastore, and it gets used only for client side authorization.
hive.metastore.pre.event.listeners setting can be used to control if metastore authorization is enabled or not., Does this need to be clarified in the userdoc?

The parameter descriptions are fine, but maybe the client/metastore distinction should be spelled out:

* hive.security.authorization.enabled -- Enable or disable the Hive client authorization.  [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.security.authorization.enabled]

* hive.metastore.pre.event.listeners -- The pre-event listener classes to be loaded on the metastore side to run code whenever databases, tables, and partitions are created, altered, or dropped. Set this configuration property to org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.AuthorizationPreEventListener in hive-site.xml for Hive metastore security.  [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.metastore.pre.event.listeners], I think the configuration doc is fine. It was just me not RTFM ! :)

, Maybe I should stop trying to make more work.  ;)]
