[Is there a warning log added in HIVE-11016 present in the logs?, [~sershe] - Are you referring to "LOG.warn("fetchDone[" + tag + "] was set to true (by a recursive call) and will be reset");" ?. No, I do not find that in the logs. , Well, then it's some other issue, attaching query (col names and table names modified) which caused the issue.

SELECT v1.rid,
       v1.`jeid`,
       v1.`jelid`,

            `ejeid`,

            `pid`
   HAVING cnd > 1) test ON (test.`pid` = v1.`pid`);

Basically, CommonMergeJoinOperator::fetchNextGroup had the issue.
e.g it entered the following condition in code (foundNextKeyGroup[t]=false, fetchDone[t]=false, t=1, orderLen=2, posBigTable=0)

Fixing it in ReduceRecordSource which deals with the readers.  Need to check if the same has to be done in MapRecordSource.

[~gopalv], [~sershe] - Please review when you find time.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12766760 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~rajesh.balamohan], we hit the same issue recently. But I think the patch you attached did not fix the root problem. 

The issue is actually CommonMergeJoinOperator only set big table position when it has inputs for big table. 

{code:title=CommonMergeJoinOperator.java}
  @Override
  public void process(Object row, int tag) throws HiveException {
    posBigTable = (byte) conf.getBigTablePosition();
...
{code}

If the input is empty, the above method will not be called. In the query you listed, a subquery is involved. The generated table is tagged as 0, while the left table is tagged as 1.  GenTezWork.java set the big table position as 1 for both reduce work and CommonJoinOperator. In reduce phase, when ReduceRecordProcessor got executed, it retrieves the record from big table:

{code:title=ReduceRecordProcessor.java}
@Override
  void run() throws Exception {
....
    // run the operator pipeline
    while (sources[bigTablePosition].pushRecord()) {
    }
  }
{code}

The big table position here is 1. If the input from the big table is empty, this is the only place pushRecord() be called to read big table. However, because the CommonMergeJoinOperator missed set big table position, in closeOp() part, it will think tag 1 is small table, so another pushRecord() is called to retrieve table content. Then we see the exception listed in this JIRA. 

Please let me know if my analysis has problem. If you think it is correct, can you update the patch?

Thanks, [~rajesh.balamohan], et al., [~selinazh]'s analysis here seems accurate. Wouldn't her suggestion (i.e. to move {{posBigTable = (byte) conf.getBigTablePosition();}} to {{initializeOp()}}) fix the problem?

Would anyone else like to comment?, That sounds reasonable - since this is unassigned and AFAIK [~rajesh.balamohan] has been dragged into hadoop-common/hdfs, can [~selinazh] take over and provide a patch?

For now, this is +1 - tests pending., Kewl. Assigned to [~selinazh]. Should have our patch out soon., [~selinazh], could we please post our solution to this JIRA?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12766760 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~selinazh] Is there a patch available? 

After applying the patch (https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12766760/HIVE-11693.1.patch), I noticed incorrect data after a left outer join.

This query returns the right number of rows
{noformat}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
    account
    LEFT JOIN contact ON contact.account_id = account.id
;
{noformat}

But, if I have a complex sub-query on the right, then I get 0 rows back
{noformat}
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM
    account
    LEFT JOIN (
        SELECT DISTINCT
            contact.email_domain AS email_domain,
            contact.account_id
        FROM
            contact
            JOIN (
                SELECT
                    account_id,
                    COUNT(DISTINCT email_domain) AS email_domain_count
                FROM
                    contact
                GROUP BY
                    account_id
                ) email_domain_counts
                ON contact.account_id = email_domain_counts.account_id
                    AND email_domain_counts.email_domain_count = 1
        WHERE
            contact.account_id != ''
    ) contact ON contact.account_id = account.id
;
{noformat}

If, I change hive.execution.engine to mr, then it returns the number of rows in account
