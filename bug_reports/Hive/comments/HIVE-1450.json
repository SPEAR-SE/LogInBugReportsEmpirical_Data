We do not have insert, update, or delete but we do have DDL. So this method should work for us. , Review request: https://reviews.facebook.net/D4293
, Comments on phabricator, Any updates on this JIRA? Is there something blocking this?, @Mark: Namit requested that I add negative test coverage for each of the exceptions that are thrown by the modified version of executeUpdate. I have requested clarification from him on this point and am waiting for him to respond. For more information on this please refer to the phabricator code review link above. Thanks.
