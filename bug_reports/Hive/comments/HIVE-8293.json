[It is easy to reproduce:
{block}
hive> create table a (col string) partitioned by (dt string);
hive> create table b (col string) partitioned by (idx int); 
hive> alter table a add partition(dt='20140808');
hive> alter table b add partition(idx=50);  
hive> select * from b where idx < 10;
{block}, Use the similar workaround as DERBY-6358 : add projected column to case-when.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12671854, 1) Can you please retain the quotes? they are necessary for Postgres.
2) Can you update comment to say it affects Oracle too?
