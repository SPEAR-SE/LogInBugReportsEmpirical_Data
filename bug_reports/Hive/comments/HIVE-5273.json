[Unconfirmed but will mark as a blocker., [~mikelewis] What do you mean by local tasktracker ? Do you mean running hive with -hiveconf mapred.job.tracker=local  ?
Looks like you get a different problem with 'non-local tasktracker' . Do you know if the result you see with 0.12 corresponds to something (say non-null records only, or some partitions only). Can you describe the details of the input table, queries and what you are seeing in that mode ? Is the result from 0.10 correct ?

, I am unable to reproduce this issue with hive trunk and branch 0.12 . Please let me know if I am not following the right steps here.

By local task tracker, I assume you meant local mode jobtracker. To run in local mode, I used - 
echo $HIVE_OPTS 
-hiveconf mapred.job.tracker=local -hiveconf fs.default.name=file:///tmp -hiveconf hive.metastore.warehouse.dir=file:///tmp/warehouse -hiveconf javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL=jdbc:derby:;databaseName=/tmp/metastore_db;create=true


This is what i tried -
//create table
{code}
hive> create table ts(s string);
OK
Time taken: 0.02 seconds
hive> select s from ts limit 5;
{code}

//adding data to table
{code}
$ perl -e 'for (my $i=0; $i<100000000; $i++){ print "asdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasdfasd\n";}'  >  /tmp/warehouse/ts/input
$ du -hs /tmp/warehouse/ts/input
3.4G    /tmp/warehouse/ts/input

{code}


//running the test
{code}
hive> select s from ts limit 5;
