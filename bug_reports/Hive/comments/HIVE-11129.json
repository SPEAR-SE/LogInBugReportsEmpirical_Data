ATTACHMENT ID: 12743137 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Seems those tests are not related to the patch., [~szehon] Can you take a look at this patch? It's a simple fix to add a warning when converting between UTF-8 and other charset which could lead to some data not convertable. Do you think it's reasonable to add that?, Is it only invalid characters that get mangled during the conversion?  Don't really have the context., That should be the case. While seems like the warning may be too restrict since converting between UTF-8, UTF-16 and UTF-32 should cause no loss. let me handle that case., Only issue a warning for ISO-8859 and ASCII since other unicode charsets can be converted with no issues., +1,
