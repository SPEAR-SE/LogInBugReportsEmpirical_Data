[I think this patch should address this issue - the common class between timestamp/numeric (up to double) will be treated as double. Are there any Hive scholars that can confirm that this is the correct behavior?, can you add test to some q file? , I attached a modified version of ../../ql/src/test/results/clientpositive/vectorization_7.q that first makes sure the query had a Map stage and vectorizes instead of the Fetch stage (SET hive.fetch.task.conversion=minimal).

I get differences when vectorization is turned off and on with this q file.  Not sure what is going on.  Haven't tried CBO yet., (Note the query does compare a timestamp column against an integer not a double)., I think there may be something wrong with the vectorized query.

First, let's take a look at time timestamp to numeric value conversion for the value used in the timestamp predicates:
{noformat}
hive> select ts, cast(ts as int), cast(ts as double) from (select cast(-29071.0 as timestamp) as ts) as q;
1969-12-31 07:55:29	-29071	-29071.0

hive> select ts, cast(ts as int), cast(ts as double) from (select cast(0.0 as timestamp) as ts) as q;     
1969-12-31 16:00:00	0	0.0
{noformat}

So substituting in the numeric comparisons for timestamp comparisons, in theory these 2 queries below should return the same result. But in vectorized mode they do not.  With vectorized mode off, these queries both return 1826 with the attached patch.

{noformat}
hive> SET hive.vectorized.execution.enabled=true;
hive> select count(*) 
    > FROM   alltypesorc
    > WHERE  
    > ((ctinyint != 0)
    >     AND 
    >         (((ctimestamp1 <= 0) 
    >             OR ((ctinyint = cint) OR (cstring2 LIKE 'ss')))
    >          AND ((988888 < cdouble)
    >              OR ((ctimestamp2 > -29071) AND (3569 >= cdouble)))))
    > ;
OK

{noformat}, Though I'm not sure about patch v1 as the best fix for this issue - this allows numeric-to-timestamp comparisons by allowing implicit conversions between double and timestamps.  I don't want to just enable implicit conversions - for example it was a change which allowed implicit conversions between string and dates/timestamps which seems to have caused this particular issue about numeric-to-timestamp comparisons in the first place., Patch v2 allows timestamp and numeric types to be compared as double, without having to allow implicit conversions between timestamp and numeric. Also add q file test.,
