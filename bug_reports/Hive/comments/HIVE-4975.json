[We've also run into this issue. [~owen.omalley] do you or your team have any insights on the root cause? I verified that the same problem didn't happen on rcfile, but instead null will be shown under the newly added column. , Also, the problem does not just happen when we do SELECT *, but any time we include the newly added columns in SELECT. Query runs fine when we only have old columns in SELECT clause., Hi [~kevinwilfong] do you have insights to this issue? , This is probably the fix

ATTACHMENT ID: 12631980, Just return null is not enough.Think about change the name of a column , or change the order of the columns ., The goal of this patch is just feature parity with other file formats, e.g. RC file.  AFAIK, no formats in Hive handle reordering of columns, or swapping the names of columns (I'm assuming that's what you're worried about with regards to changing the name of a column)., +1, The .1 patch wasn't applying cleanly. Also there was diff between hadoop-1 and hadoop-2. Added order by to fix the diff., +1 for 0.13, Committed to trunk and branch. Thanks [~kevinwilfong]!]
