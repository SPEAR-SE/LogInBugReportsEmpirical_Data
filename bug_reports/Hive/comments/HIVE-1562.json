[Error looks similar to the one on HADOOP-5759., There is a bug in CombineFileInputFormat and you would need to patch hadoop core with HADOOP-5759. If you cannot patch core, you could patch the client side and use HADOOP-1938 which is what we are doing., cool - thanks for the tip. looks like this is fixed in 0.20.2 - so if we can make that the default hadoop version dependency for hive - that would be enough.

seems like ivy/maven are not finding 0.20.2 (whereas there are hadoop jiras saying that these versions have been published - so looks like some fix needed in our dependency management stuff)

will change title.]
