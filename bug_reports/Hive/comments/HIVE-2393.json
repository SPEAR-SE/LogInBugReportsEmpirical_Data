[This is a single-character update to udf_named_struct.q.out which fixes a test diff I introduced when I committed HIVE-1360. I think the diff was introduced by a pre-commit whitespace trigger in svn., +1

The diff only for the testcase. The testcase passes after the patch. 

I just committed this. Thanks Carl!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #905 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/905/])
