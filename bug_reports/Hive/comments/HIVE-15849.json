{quote}, [~alangates] could you please take a look? add unit test , checking the var.  We do not get the result just because the vars are not added to scope, Patch looks good.  We just need the test run.  I'll cancel the patch and return it to patch available to try to get those to run., [~ashutoshc] Could you please manually trigger the Jenkins job for this issue? Maybe PreCommitAdmin does not work, but  i have no login privileges to builds@apache. Thanks,
