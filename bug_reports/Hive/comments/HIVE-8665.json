ATTACHMENT ID: 12678092 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, [~hagleitn] These are tests changes (not core code). It would be good to have them in 0.14 to ensure quality of release.
, Yeah, agree. Would be good to have this working on Windows too. +1 for hive .14. Can one of you guys kick off a 14 build/unit test to make sure everything still works after we commit?
, Committed to trunk/branch-0.14. [~thejas], do you know how to kick off the tests for 0.14? I don't believe I have access., Kicked off http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/HIVE-0.14-HADOOP-2/3/
, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
