ATTACHMENT ID: 12868255 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~Ferd]: please help review.  I guess that the failled 3 tests are not related with HIVE-16675.patch, LGTM +1, Why use a {{CopyOnWriteArrayList}}? {{childErrorLog}} is going to be mutated by the {{Redirector}} object up to 1000 times ({{MAX_ERR_LOG_LINES_FOR_RPC)}}. {{CopyOnWriteArrayList}} will create a new list for each mutation, so that means 1000 lists will be created, which seems inefficient. Why not use {{Collections. synchronizedList}} or even {{LinkedBlockingQueue}}., [~stakiar]: sorry to reply late.
in HIVE-16675.1.patch, i use {{Collections. synchronizedList}}, help to review.,
