[In Hive qtests, there is a query PreExecute hook EnforceReadOnlyTables which enforces that all test sources tables (e.g. src) should not be written, otherwise it throws the RuntimeException as we saw in the log. 
But the query like "explain analyze analyze table src compute statistics" in explainanalyze_3.q, or 5.q set query table src as a WriteEntity in its process for the replication reason (see comments in SemanticAnalyzer.setupStats(..))
[~pxiong] Is the query "explain analyze analyze table src compute statistics" in those tests only for testing the explain analyze for column stats commands, or is there any other uses? Could you review the patch? Thanks, Thanks a lot [~ctang.ma], the patch LGTM. +1 pending QA tests., The tests are only for testing the explain analyze purpose.,
