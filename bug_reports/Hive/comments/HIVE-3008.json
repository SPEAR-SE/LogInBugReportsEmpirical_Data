[There is a weakhashmap which is from TTransport->TUGIContainingTransport. The map is weak so that when TTransport gets out of scope, it can be GC'ed even though map contains a reference to it. But, since TUGIContainingTransport contains a reference to TTransport, even when TTransport is out of scope otherwise, its ref is still retained. Solution is to wrap reference of TTransport in TUGIContainingTransport in WeakReference.  , Sometimes, phabricator doesn't like you and doesn't post back.  In those times you post yourself. https://reviews.facebook.net/D3069, Ready for review., +1 will commit.
