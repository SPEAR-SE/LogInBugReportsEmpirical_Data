[Hi,

can anyone please have a look at this issue and help me with this!

Much appreciated! Thank you,
Krish, Hello, I was planning to look into this...but I'm not yet understand the goal of the query; could you give a smaller example possibly?
By using "unbounded preceeding" you would like to get the maximum so-far - am I correct?

hmm...you've written "rows unbounded preceding and unbounded following" but your query only contains unbounded preceding...

Could you give a sample which can be executed? 
{code}
create table t (a int,b int);
insert into t values (1,1),(1,2),(1,3),(2,4),(2,5),(2,6),(3,7),(3,8),(3,9);
select a,b,sum(b) over (partition by a order by b rows unbounded preceding) from t;
{code}
