ATTACHMENT ID: 12705138 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~xuefuz] and [~szehon] could you review this patch to see if it makes sense? Thanks in advance., Yea makes sense, although the message might make more sense as 'Rename partition: source partition [part_name] does not exist', because 'renamed' make it seem like its already renamed.  Sorry to make you run the test again , wonder what you think., Thanks [~szehon] for review. I have update the patch based on your comments and also uploaded the new patch to RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/32190/ Thanks., Patch LGTM. I will leave it to Szehon to a final review., +1, thanks Chaoyu,
