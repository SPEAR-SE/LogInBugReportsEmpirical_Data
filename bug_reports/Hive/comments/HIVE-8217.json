ATTACHMENT ID: 12670469, The change to the QueueStatusBean and Server look reasonable. +1

That said, I assume the diffs of env.sh and webhcat-site.xml that add a sqoop path are accidental and not part of this patch?, those diffs are not accidental, though strictly speaking not related to 'jobs' issue.  The fix a minor issue in test harness., I see. Okay, they look reasonable too, although normally, I guess they'd have gone into a different patch just to make matters of separation (in case of future rollbacks, or refering to issues) easier. This is fine though., Committed to trunk(0.14 still). Thanks, Eugene!, This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
