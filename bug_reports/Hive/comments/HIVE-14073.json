[New configs that have been added since HIVE-10678, that are candidates for the whitelist -

hive.strict.checks.large.query

hive.strict.checks.cartesian.product
hive.transpose.aggr.join
hive.mapjoin.optimized.hashtable.probe.percent

hive.vectorized.*
hive.support.special.characters.tablename
hive.tez.bucket.pruning
hive.tez.bucket.pruning.compat
hive.llap.* ?
, [~sershe] [~sseth] Are the hive.llap configs expected to be modified by the individual end user or are they considered 'hive admin' parameters that should be set by hive admins in hive config files ?
I am guessing its the later, and even if user tries to set many of these params, it won't take effect as the LLAP deamons would already be running with config values from the files.
Please confirm.
, Hmm... what does the whitelist do? Does it mean users cannot modify these configs? Some of them can be set by user, I can make a list., [~sershe] When SQL std auth or ranger is enabled, only configs in this whitelist can be set by HS2 users .
Yes, if you can create a list of configs that should be settable per query by the user that would be great.
, [~sershe] Can you please provide that list that is settable by the user (and should be so) ?

, Sorry fell thru the cracks... let me do this now, Here they are. 2 IO settings (perhaps we should a separate one to skip cache), hosts, and a bunch of compile time settings, mostly related to decider.
{noformat}
"hive.llap.io.enabled", null,
"hive.llap.io.use.fileid.path", true,

"hive.llap.daemon.service.hosts", null,

"hive.llap.execution.mode", "none",
"hive.llap.auto.allow.uber", false,
"hive.llap.auto.enforce.tree", true,
"hive.llap.auto.enforce.vectorized", true,
"hive.llap.auto.enforce.stats", true,
"hive.llap.auto.max.input.size", 10*1024*1024*1024L,
"hive.llap.auto.max.output.size", 1*1024*1024*1024L,
"hive.llap.skip.compile.udf.check", false,
"hive.llap.client.consistent.splits", false,
"hive.llap.enable.grace.join.in.llap", false,

"hive.llap.allow.permanent.fns", true,
{noformat}, these should be modifiable by user ie in CLI or beeline, Thanks for the list [~sershe]! It would be great if we could follow some common prefix for config parameters that are supposed to be settable by the end user via beeline.
Maybe "hive.llap.client."  or "hive.llap.optimize." ..
That way I can add that regex to the whitelist and whitelist doesn't need any further update for new params. cc [~sseth]

ATTACHMENT ID: 12813593 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, OOZIE-2355 sets oozie.* params to enable tracking of hive jobs. Adding regex to allow those params to be set.

, [~sershe] - Is "hive.llap.allow.permanent.fns" configurable by users ?

There's a bunch of other settings which apply to the AM. However, there's no consistent way for these to actually get used, since they require a restart of the AM at the moment. It's better to leave them as not-configurable at the moment. e.g. LLAP_TASK_SCHEDULER_NODE_REENABLE_MIN_TIMEOUT_MS, LLAP_TASK_SCHEDULER_NODE_REENABLE_MAX_TIMEOUT_MS, LLAP_TASK_SCHEDULER_NODE_DISABLE_BACK_OFF_FACTOR, LLAP_TASK_SCHEDULER_NUM_SCHEDULABLE_TASKS_PER_NODE, LLAP_TASK_SCHEDULER_LOCALITY_DELAY

Would be good to separate the client configs into a separate list at least, if not renaming them / moving them to other files. There's a jira open for this - but not done yet., hive.llap.allow.permanent.fns should not be settable by user iirc. It's about packaging right?, +1.,
