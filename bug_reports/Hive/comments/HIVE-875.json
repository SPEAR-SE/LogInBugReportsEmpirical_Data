[This is not a code issue but caused by conflicting jar files (different versions of libthrift.jar and libfb303.jar) in the Hadoop's lib directory and Hive's lib directory. 

Thrift and FB303 are used to establish connections between Hive server and client. When Hive server is started, the jar files in Hadoop's lib directory are used. When the client is started (the Hive service unit test), the Hive's version is used. The causes Thrift RPC call errors. 

To solve this issue, Hadoop+Hive distributions should make sure the two jar files are the same. A cleaner solution may be to remove the two jar files from the Hadoop distribution since they were there because Hive needs them., sovled by resolving conflict of libthrift.jar and libfb303.jar in hadoop's and hive's lib directory. ]
