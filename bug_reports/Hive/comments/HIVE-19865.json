[What is the status of this issue? , Not yet fixed. I have added "stats_sizebug.q" to address this issue., Found out the location where table stats esp., rawDataSize is supposed to be set 
in FileSinkOperator.java for ACID table.The best is of course to set accurate value for it. 
But one question is, before spending time to do that, whether rawDataSize is needed for
ACID table aggregation query for this transactional stats feature. , Hi [~ashutoshc] Do we need rawDataSize for any aggregation query for an ACID table?

Thanks, 
Steve. , No, it's not needed for aggregation... we can do it later., Ashutosh replied No. 
, OK. 
OrcRecordUpdater.getStats() or a (possibly new) subsequent is supposed to calculate 
rawDataSize if needed. 

OrcRecordUpdater.java has:
  @Override
  public SerDeStats getStats() {
    SerDeStats stats = new SerDeStats();
    stats.setRowCount(rowCountDelta);
    // Don't worry about setting raw data size diff.  I have no idea how to calculate that
    // without finding the row we are updating or deleting, which would be a mess.
    return stats;
  }
