ATTACHMENT ID: 12860924 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~aihuaxu], [~vihangk1] could you review? This is an improvement to the test infra for running HDFS encryption tests. When commands such as {{CRYPTO CREATE_KEY}} fail, the whole stack trace is now printed out.

Test failures are all flaky tests:

HIVE-16320 - TestBeeLineDriver.testCliDriver[escape_comments]
HIVE-16256 - TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[comments]
HIVE-16312 - TestHCatClient.testTransportFailure, +1, Pushed to master. Thanks, Sahil!, Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
