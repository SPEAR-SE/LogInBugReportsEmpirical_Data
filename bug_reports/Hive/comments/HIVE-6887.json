, [~ashutoshc] thinks *hive.serdes.using.metastore.for.schema* shouldn't be documented (see HIVE-6681 comment), but perhaps he'll agree with what the patch says:

<description>This an internal parameter. Check with the hive dev. team</description>

We have at least one other parameter that's deliberately undocumented., yup.. description looks good to me. Additionally, this code may get redone on trunk, so this may no longer be there in future versions., We should probably adopt a naming convention to be used for such params in future.
Maybe "hive.internal.*" ?
, [~leftylev] thanks for looking at this.

bq. We have at least one other parameter that's deliberately undocumented.

Does this need to be added? I am happy to add it with a similar comment.

Are you good with this patch, besides the 1 parameter issue?, Trivial edits, _all of which can be fixed post-0.13_:

* All-caps PAM in "List of the underlying pam services ...."
* Init-cap Hive in "Check with the hive dev. team"
* Init-cap Hive & Tez in "... joins in hive when tez is used ..."
* *hive.txn.manager* could have a description such as "Hive transaction manager" (or something more useful) but it's pretty obvious from the parameter name
* Init-cap Time in "time after which transactions are declared aborted ..."
* Add "to be" in "Time in seconds between checks to see if any partitions need {to be} compacted."
* Some lines are too long:
** value for *hive.serdes.using.metastore.for.schema* (unavoidable?)
** description for *hive.limit.query.max.table.partition*
** description for *hive.compactor.initiator.on*
** description for *hive.compactor.worker.timeout*
** description for *hive.compactor.check.interval* (2nd line)
** description for *hive.compactor.delta.num.threshold*
** description for *hive.compactor.delta.pct.threshold*
** description for *hive.compactor.abortedtxn.threshold*, +1, without any edits.  I can take care of the edit list later in trunk.

I'll look up the deliberately undocumented parameter, but it's nothing to hold up the show.  Most likely we have many accidentally undocumented parameters from previous releases -- that's a project on my to-do list., [~rhbutani], what's the story with adding the value "fs" and changing the default value, which I forgot to mention, for hive.stats.dbclass (HIVE-6500)?  In the email thread you said it's "already attached" but I didn't understand., bq. We have at least one other parameter that's deliberately undocumented.

*hive.stats.key.prefix* is what I had in mind (see comments by me & Navis on HIVE-6229, use link below).

I've been going through the patch for HIVE-6037 and found several parameters marked "internal" -- they all have descriptions except *hive.stats.key.prefix*.

I also found 46 parameters without descriptions in the first 2/3 of the parameter list.  Still working on that.

Lefty thanks for your help with this issue.]
