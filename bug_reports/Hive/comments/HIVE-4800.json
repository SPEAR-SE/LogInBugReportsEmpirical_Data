[Looks like the root cause of this is HIVE-2703 - if the partition column was correctly treated as the timestamp type rather than as a string type then this would not be an issue. 
Noticed this same issue during while making changes for Date type (HIVE-4055), though I did a workaround by allowing comparisons between string and date types. We could do the same here for timestamps.]
