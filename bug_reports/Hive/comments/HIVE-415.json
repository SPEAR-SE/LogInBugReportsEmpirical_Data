[The fix turns out to be simple:

The following code in Hive.g:
{code}
queryStatementExpression
    : queryStatement (queryOperator^ queryStatementExpression)*
    ;
{code}

should be changed to:
{code}
queryStatementExpression
    : queryStatement (queryOperator^ queryStatementExpression)?
    ;
{code}
, can you add a test case which fails without your fix and succeeds with your fix?, A better non-recursive solution:

{code}
    : queryStatement (queryOperator^ queryStatement)*
{code}

Some test outputs are changed - mainly because we had a right-deep.UNION-ALL tree, but now it's left-deep. There are no semantic changes.


Tested with the long UNION-ALL query. It works now.
, I am going over the output file changes - just wanted to be sure
otherwise looks good
, The output files look good, but as Raghu said, can you add a test with lots of unions.
, Added the test query. This is for branch-0.3.
Will make a patch for trunk soon.
, For trunk., Let's commit HIVE-372 first, since it's already in branch-0.3 (but not in trunk yet).
, Committed. Thanks Zheng]
