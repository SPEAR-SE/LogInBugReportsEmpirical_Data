[[~gopalv] Can you briefly put some explanation on how container reuse works here? I talked to [~ashutoshc], he's not very convinced how that can happen, given the understanding of how operator pipeline works - every time we are creating a new object even using the same jvm., [~ashutoshc] Tez keeps an object registry / object cache. That explains why we're not necessarily creating new objects every time., Yes, the plan is not deserialized again for a new split. 

The same operator tree is used but at the end each split it calls closeOp() and then calls initializeOp().

This means we can hold onto hashtables and similar bits which were built during a previous split.,
