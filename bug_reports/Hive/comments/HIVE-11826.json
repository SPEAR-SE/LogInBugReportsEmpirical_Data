[The patch will authorize the current user before accessing metastore. It will fail if the user's group is not in hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12756028 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Change the TestHadoop20SAuthBridge.java to be the one for version23 since version23S is already removed from the code base. , I mean HadoopThriftAuthBridge20S.java is already removed., +1, Thanks Chao for reviewing the code. [~ashutoshc]  can you also help take a look at the code? , Seems like even in 0.13 https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/ff80bddb86d7a7c4804bf388f8324056f6b1dae0/shims/common-secure/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/thrift/HadoopThriftAuthBridge20S.java#L612 we were not calling this. So, wondering how it worked then? 
Also, this method is deprecated in favor of one without Configuration argument.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12756365 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Sorry. I didn't upstream 0.13 but in CDH5.3.3 with Hive-0.13 which seems to have correct change. Then upstream 0.13 will also have the same issue. I will update to use the newer version.

            // ensure that metastore user has privilege to impersonate the requesting user
            ProxyUsers.authorize(clientUgi,

cc: [~sushanth] [~thejas], I will still keep the deprecated version for now since seems  we have dependency issue in pom.xml which still includes old version of hadoop-core in the classpath which will fail the build. I was looking into that since we also have problems in other place but I'm not familiar with dependency yet., Committed to master and branch-1. Thanks Aihua., Thanks Chao., Does this bug fix need any documentation?, Hi [~leftylev] the doc seems not necessary since 'hadoop.proxyuser.hive.groups' should work as it supposed to be while we just had this issue. This is to correct the incorrect implementation. 

Let me know if anyone else has different opinion and I can provide more info if needed.  , Okay, thanks Aihua Xu.]
