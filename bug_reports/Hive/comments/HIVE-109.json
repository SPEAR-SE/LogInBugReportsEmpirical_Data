[Adding to "Query Processor" component., I think there are quite a few people who use this feature and those usecases will break by fixing this. But I don't see any problem here, if users don't want their data to be deleted with the table they can use EXTERNAL flag otherwise they will not use it. It does not matter whether 'location' has been specified or not., What's a resolution on this? Does it mean that only significance of EXTERNAL is that data will not be dropped on drop table and only metadata will be deleted? ]
