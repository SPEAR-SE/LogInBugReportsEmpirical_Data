ATTACHMENT ID: 12790238 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The tests failures for patch2 are not related. , Seems we should also handle "ALTER TABLE table_name SET TBLPROPERTIES" case. Probably we can do that in org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.CompressionKind class to override ValueOf() so we can handle both cases in one place. When it's called, we will convert to upper case and throw exception if it's not one of the value., attach patch3, it should cover all the required cases. , Seems the change in SemanticAnalyzer.java is not necessary? 

The change looks good since actually we can't override ValueOf().

+1.,
