[This is probably better as question on the mailing list rather than a JIRA.  Can you post the logs for your metastore server?  I definitely haven't seen this issue before., Hi Alan,

Hope everything is good at your end & thanks for your reply.

Here I have attached metastore logs and the screen shot of "SHOW TABLES "
command before & after including configurations in hive-site.xml for CURD
operations.So usually it takes a time to run this command is milliseconds
but after making changes in hive-site.xml its time is 1 min that we can
observe the screen shots.

, It's spending it's time trying to connect to ZooKeeper, which it should not be doing.  Can you share the exact hive-site.xml changes you made?, Hi Alan,

, Hi Alan,

Hope everything is good at your end.
Did you check my hive-site.xml ?
Did I make any mistake in  configurations ?

Regards,
Jasthi.

    <description>
      Set to org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager as part of turning on Hive
      transactions, which also requires appropriate settings for hive.compactor.initiator.on,
      hive.compactor.worker.threads, hive.support.concurrency (true), hive.enforce.bucketing
      (true), and hive.exec.dynamic.partition.mode (nonstrict).
      The default DummyTxnManager replicates pre-Hive-0.13 behavior and provides
      no transactions.

This should be DbTxnManager if you want to use update and delete.  It won't work with DummyTxnManager.  The reason it's taking a long time is when you set the txn manager to Dummy and the concurrency to true you get the zookeeper lock manager, which is taking time trying to connect to zookeeper.]
