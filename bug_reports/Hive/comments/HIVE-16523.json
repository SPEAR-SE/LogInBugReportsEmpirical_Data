[[~gopalv] [~mmccline] do you mind taking a look?
With this patch, I see the collisions in Q58 reduced to 1-2 elements per hash code (from 400-1200 for the worst codes before)., Pretty intense.  Great job.  +1 LGTM, Updated to have a hash object after some discussion cc [~gopalv],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12865018 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Broke this patch with my other commit - rebasing + minor refactor., Hmm.. is it a good idea to store hash ctx in every wrapper? it seems like 1000s of refs of overhead., bq. is it a good idea to store hash ctx in every wrapper?

That was an assumption - the current object has a 4 byte slack.

     44     4   org.apache.hadoop.hive.common.type.HiveIntervalDayTime[] VectorHashKeyWrapper.intervalDayTimeValues   null
     48     4                                                  boolean[] VectorHashKeyWrapper.isNull                  null
