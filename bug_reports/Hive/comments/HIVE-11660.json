[[~sershe] - have you seen this fail before. I thought TestLlapTaskScheduelr used to fail earlier., woops. I guess it's a different test, Nm, TestLlapTaskSchedulerService is also flaky :), Attaching patch to fix the tests. Have run 100 iterations of both on a Linux box - where the failures are normally seen - with all of them passing.

There's some real bugs which were causing TestLlapTaskSchedulerService to fail. The last allocateTaskRequest for a dag could've ended up being ignored.
Also in TaskScheduler, the waitQueue can be improved - filed a separate jira for this.

[~sershe] - please review., On the TaskExecutor, this mainly moves some code around - removing the scheduled task from the waitQueue is now in the same sync block instead of being in separate synchronized blocks., can you post rb, https://reviews.apache.org/r/37960/, Updated patch to convert some of the AtomicBooleans to booleans., +1, Thanks for the review. Committing to the llap branch.]
