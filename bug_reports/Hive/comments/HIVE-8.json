[The dynamic serde itself support is actually almost done as part of the jira to add the unit tests for this.  it currently works with TJSONProtocol but not TBinaryProtocol so some minor bug.
, DynamicSerDe now fully supports nested structures and was committed as part of one of those initial megacommits.

Need support from CLI and metastore for this now.
, Marking this as resolved as this has already been fixed. Zheng please confirm.]
