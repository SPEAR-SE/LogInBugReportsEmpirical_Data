[Are row-level ACL's the motivation for this change?, Enforcing security on a per row basis could be one use of such a hook. The hook can be used in other ways to apply custom transformations to the result set before returning to the client., If the main use case is row-level security, then I think we're better off adding this functionality in a way that makes the additional work visible to the optimizer, e.g. with views.

I think it would help to provide some more details about the motivation for this patch, possibly including a concrete use-case as well. Thanks., This is a general purpose hook and is not specific to any feature. Hive has hooks at various stages of compilation and execution - pre semantic analysis, post semantic analysis, pre execution etc, but misses a post execution/post fetch hook. This JIRA just adds that., Ok, but can you give me an actual example of something that requires this functionality?

What kind of information do you plan to make available to the hook?

I also think we need to be really careful about providing a way for people to mutate the resultset after it has been generated since this work will be done on the server node in a non-distributed fashion.]
