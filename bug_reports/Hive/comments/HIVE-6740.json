[Good catch, seems to affect 0.13 as well.  Did you want to submit a fix, or let others take a look ?, Nah, I don't have a fix, I figured someone could just correct this at their convenience :), Thanks Grisha for the analysis, attaching the fix.

Built + verified that org.apache.avro.mapred classes including FsInput is in the hive-exec uber-jar., Skip precommit tests, verify by building normally., +1

Does this sound bad enough to be included in 0.13?, Thanks Xuefu, yea it would be good to include in 0.13 if possible, its looks very similar to the typo you fixed about the parquet dependency and would have similar affect., +1 for 0.13, Committed to trunk and 0.13]
