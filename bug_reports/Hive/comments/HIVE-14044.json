[I checked and this issue is no longer present in the master branch.

The query: {{select foo, map_keys(bar), map_values(bar) from broken_newline_map}}

Prints:

{code}
+------+------------------+-------------------------------------+--+
| foo  |        c1        |                 c2                  |
+------+------------------+-------------------------------------+--+
| 1    | ["key1","key2"]  | ["value1\nafter newline","value2"]  |
| 2    | ["key1","key2"]  | ["new value","new value2"]          |
+------+------------------+-------------------------------------+--+
{code}, [~Sh4pe] is there anymore environment information you can provided?

I tried to re-produce this on CDH 5.5.1 but I can't reproduce is there either., Sadly, no. I just checked the Hive version:

{code}
$ hiveserver2 --version
Hive 1.1.0-cdh5.5.1
{code}, Is this still an issue for you? Have you seen this bug come up again?, I believe this issue was fixed by HIVE-11785., Thanks for the pointer Anthony. [~Sh4pe] if you can check to see if HIVE-11785 fixes your issue that would be great., [~Sh4pe] I think that's only for LazySimpleSerDe

If i look at this code it declares the SERIALIZATION_ESCAPE_CRLF property

But the avro one doesn't

Specifying it on the table does absolutely nothing for me on CDH-5.9.2, It seems that the problem is with the result format. Either setting

    set hive.query.result.fileformat = SequenceFile;

or 

    set hive.fetch.task.conversion=more;

Worked as a workaround for me]
