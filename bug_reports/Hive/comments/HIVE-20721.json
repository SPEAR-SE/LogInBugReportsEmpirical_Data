[Hi [~Ballesteros], have you tried "desc table" for your table as that's what HIVE-6681 was about?, Hi [~xuefuz]:

First of all thanks for your response.

Yes, I've tried desc table too, the result is the same:

 

> desc table_name
  
||col_name||data_type||comment||
|some_column1|bigint|from deserializer|
|some_column2|string|from deserializer|
|some_column3|string|from deserializer|
|...|...|...|

 

If I use _desc extended table_name_, in "Detailed Table Information" I see the json with the correct comments, but the comments in the rows with the table columns name only show "from deserializer", as it does with _desc table_name_.]
