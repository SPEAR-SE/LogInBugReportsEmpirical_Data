[Could you show me the implementation of getDisplayString() in custUDF?, {code:java} public String getDisplayString(String[] children) {
		return "PurswayCleanNameUDF";
	}
{code}, Sorry, I should have used different way to discern expressions, instead of getExprString(), which is dependent to implementation., use hive.cache.expr.evaluation=false, for walkaround., This is the workaround i'm using. Thank you.

But why does it work as separate columns and not inside a 2nd function?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12653121, Currently, expr cache is applied per column basis for SELECT op. Seemed to be extended to apply it cross columns., May be {{key=eval.getExpr().getClass().getName()}} is better choice than getExpr().toString() ?, It should discern whole expression including children, so we needed that., +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks Ashutosh, for the review!, This bug fix is documented in the wiki with hive.cache.expr.evaluation:

* [Configuration Properties -- hive.cache.expr.evaluation | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.cache.expr.evaluation], The bug is also documented in the UDF wiki, in an information box at the beginning:

* [LanguageManual -- Operators and UDFs | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+UDF], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
