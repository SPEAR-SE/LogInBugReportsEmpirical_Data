ATTACHMENT ID: 12738823 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, These failed tests seem not relevant to this patch., [~ctang.ma], is it possible to remove the whole method from CLIService?, [~jxiang] It is possible since it only calls the upperclass start(), but I thought that but still left it there because 1) to be consistent with the stop method; 2) in case in future CLIService needs add something especially in start, whose method already exists., I see. The other choice is to remove the stop() as well :). Either way is fine with me. Thanks., Thanks, [~jxiang]. Could you help to commit it?, Integrated into trunk and branch 1. Thanks Chaoyu for the patch.]
