ATTACHMENT ID: 12786855 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~alangates] Can you take a look as Eugene is not available?, The patch looks fine, but I'm unclear what issue this is causing.  Are we just saving an unnecessary call to the metastore?, This essentially will avoid having too much unnecessary logging for non-ACID table, especially in extreme cases where there are hundreds of thousands of transactions, Ok, +1, [~daijy] Can you help commit the patches to master and branch-1? Thanks., Patch committed to both master/branch-1.]
