ATTACHMENT ID: 12658341, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Navis!, Thanks, Navis. Shall we modify ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/LoadSemanticAnalyzer.java too?, The code part in LoadSemanticAnalyzer you've mentioned is removed already by HIVE-6024. I don't know the exact story on it but it seemed not needed anymore., Yes, you are right. I realize that I am using hive release 0.13.1 where HIVE-6024 is not included. Thanks, Navis., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
