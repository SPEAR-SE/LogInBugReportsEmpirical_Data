ATTACHMENT ID: 12839786 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I need to regenerate the q file for the negative test of _join45.q_ because I changed the error code; rest of failures are unrelated., I noted catch-all condition for outer join checks. But, still I prefer to have checks at the point where it matters, since we know what exact limitations we have. However, since you are making all those restrictions go away, this wont matter anyway.
+1, Pushed to master, thanks for reviewing [~ashutoshc]!, Should this be documented in the wiki?, [~leftylev], I want to be done with HIVE-15251 before doing it, but it certainly should. Thanks, [~leftylev], I added some documentation for the join extensions in https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+Joins., Will UDFs be supported in complex expressions in the ON clause?

I hit this limitation when I had two tables I wanted to join on based on the intersection of array columns.


{noformat}
create table tbl_a (
  val string,
  ids array<string>
);

create table tbl_b (
  val string,
  ids array<string>
);

add jar hdfs:///brickhouse-0.7.1-SNAPSHOT.jar;

select a.val, b.val
from tbl_a as a
join tbl_b as b
on (size(intersect_array(a.ids, b.ids)) > 0);
{noformat}

An intersection size > 0 is a somewhat trivial case, but if requirements were such that the intersection size was needed within a specific range it makes this query much more difficult., [~calebjones], have you tried with latest master? You should not hit that limitation anymore, as we should support any arbitrary condition. Please, let me know if you do and the error you hit., Ah, sorry, I meant I hit this with Hive < 2.2.0. I have not yet tried with 2.2.0.]
