[[~sseth]/[~thejas] Can someone please take a look?, Actually, beeline doesn't need jdbc-standalone.jar to run queries. 

Since the standalone jar has shaded hadoop-* jars, that's generally going to complicate the whole "yarn jar" part at the top., Yeah. Looks like that's the case. I haven't seen any issues by not including jdbc-standalone*.jar.

I will update the patch to remove it from beeline script so that it doesn't throw the error. , +1, Committed to master and branch-2.1.]
