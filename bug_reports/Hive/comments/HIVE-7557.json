[I see two issues: A problem calling serializeVector inside VectorFileSinkOperator.processOp and a 2nd issue when the exception is caught by ReduceRecordProcessor.processVectors when trying to call toString on the batch., Matt - processOp (serialization bug) is due to the wrong projection which is not related to ReduceRecordProcessor.  In dynpart_sort_opt_vectorization.q , projected fields should be just 4. But when the data lands up in VectorizedOrcSerde, it has 5 columns.  This needs to be fixed in other layer. 

ReduceRecordProcessor.processVectors when trying to call toString on the batch, is harmless at this time.  I will fix that and upload the patch asap.
, 
The query is:
{code}
insert overwrite table over1k_part_orc partition(ds="foo", t) select si,i,b,f,t from over1korc where t is null or t=27 order by si;
{code}

The INSERT is (over)writing in the reduce-side a partitioned ORC table (i.e. writing it with VectorFileSink) in which one of the 2 partition keys comes from the SELECT query.

I suspect this is new for vectorization since the problem showed up when we started vectorizing the reduce-side., Patch #1 temporarily turns off vectorization if VectorFileSink would need to handle dynamic partitions.  This gives time to understand what is going on and fix VectorFileSink., +1. lgtm, There is some strange error with the build machine not being able to post comment.. posting below manually:

, Also vector_non_string_partition fails with same problem., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Matt McCline., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
