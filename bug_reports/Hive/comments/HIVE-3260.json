[I couldn't find ddl for creating partition with bucket number.

From org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Partition
{code}
/**
   * The number of buckets is a property of the partition. However - internally
   * we are just storing it as a property of the table as a short term measure.
   */
  public int getBucketCount() {
    return table.getNumBuckets();
{code}
Does this mean that it's not possible?, I agree - there is a alter table command


alter TABLE <TBL_NAME> CLUSTERED BY (<COLS>) INTO <n> BUCKETS;

But, the partition number of buckets are not used anywhere.

Should we just disallow alter table number of buckets in strict mode if there are some partitions present in the table ?, The correct fix would be https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-3261, It is right thing which should be done. 

But why not support buckets per partition? Would it be enough to change the code above to 
{code}
int bucketNum = sd.getNumBuckets();
return bucketNum < 0 ? table.getNumBuckets() : bucketNum;
{code}
and add some DDL syntax for partition?, I agree - this code is not the difficult part.

But, we need to make sure everywhere partition metadata is getting used, like in sampling etc.

Let us defer it for now, and get back to it later.
Do you want to open the jira for now ?]
