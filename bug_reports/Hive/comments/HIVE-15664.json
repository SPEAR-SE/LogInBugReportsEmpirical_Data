[This implements 1-2, as well as the config flag.
Skipping is only supported on VectorDeserialize; I started looking at it, should be easy to do after clearing the initial confusiong - VD doesn't support complex types anyway, so should be easy to map new ORC cols to original column indexes. 
We don't expect that to result in major gain though (compared to 1-2-4), so I postponed it for now.
Unfortunately 1 and 2 don't speed it up enough... need to do 4 - return VRBs from VectorDeserialize, and offload ORC writing to a background thread, I was looking into that today. Need to wrap my head around variety of array indexes and integer lists that various parts use. Also interface-wise it would be difficult. Will probably piggyback on Orc...Batch, [~gopalv] fyi, [~gopalv] [~mmccline] can you take a look? Thanks. It reuses some code from VectorMapOperator as part of #2, So, looks like you have a sparse column input VRB from the table but you need to cache the data ORC style with non sparse so you share columns with the destination (write) VRB. , Yes, why? :),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12848464 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~mmccline] [~gopalv] ping?, Mostly looks good. Orc changes can be avoided as we already have a way to disable dictionary encoding. , Updated the config setting. Will rename the class in another change, it would be pain to merge, lgtm, +1. Pending tests,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12849183 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Committed to master, Doc note:  This adds two configuration parameters to HiveConf.java (*hive.llap.io.encode.enabled*, *hive.llap.io.encode.vector.serde.enabled*), so they need to be documented in the wiki.
