  Wow guys..where is this code you are modifying? Will this code go into production?

  I also want to make some trivial changes (https://our.intern.facebook.com/intern/tasks/?t=830569) but I never seem to be able to checkout/compile hive code correctly (that is why I assigned this task to hive team). Do you have a wiki or something which I can follow to develop hive.

  I'm working on getting my Linux laptop able to pass Hive tests, but may be a week or two before I can commit again.
