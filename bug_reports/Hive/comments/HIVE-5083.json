[Finally found the bug by using "show extended <table> <partition spec>" to figure out that all partitions were pointing to a single file. My selects only looked like they were working, they were just reading the same data over and over.

Specifically, I created my partitions with "alter table" using multiple partition specs in the same command. Interestingly, the wiki page help said:

Note that it is proper syntax to have multiple partition_spec in a single ALTER TABLE, but if you do this in version 0.7, your partitioning scheme will fail. That is, every query specifying a partition will always use only the first partition.

I am using 0.11, not 0.7. Apparently, 0.11 (and perhaps everything after 0.7?) has this problem., The reported problem is just a symptom of a different known bug.]
