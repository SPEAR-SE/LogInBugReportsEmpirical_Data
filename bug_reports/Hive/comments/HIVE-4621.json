[Resolving it as invalid, since I can't repro this. Feel free to reopen if you can reproduce it. Also, provide steps to repro in case you are able to repro., Also, note HIVE-4632 will simplify such that lot of requirements for stats collection will no longer be present., My understanding is that "LOAD DATA LOCAL" will never update statistics esp. numRows. This is an expected behavior. The description says load data local is used so describe formatted will always show numRows as 0. , My bad. Prasanth is right. If you do insert queries than stats will be auto-gathered and displayed in describe formatted. Load statements don't gather stats. ]
