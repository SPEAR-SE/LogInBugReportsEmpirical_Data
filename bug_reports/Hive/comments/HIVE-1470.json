[Unit test?
, Oh...if it requires more than one reducer, we'll need minimr mode in order to exercise it, meaning I need to finish HIVE-117.
, Should I create a dependency on HIVE-117? The only bit that was causing the code to crash has been removed with the split-up of the Evaluator class., How about this..post an updated patch which includes the test case, setting the number of reducers explicitly.  It will be ignored for now (so the test coverage won't actually be there yet), but I'll add a note on HIVE-117 that this is a test that needs to start running in minimr mode once HIVE-117 is fixed.
, Added multiple reducers to test case, for eventual testing with minimr mode., +1.  Will commit when tests pass.
, Committed.  Thanks Mayank!
