[I'm aware Hive is on Hadoop 2.8.0 now. Wondering whether we still support older versions., I think we do... we should still be able run on it.
We'd probably need a shim. Or we can ask to re-add the method in 2.8.1 (or whatever) and not support 2.8.0.
, Filed HADOOP-14683. Let's see what the response is, and go from there., The solution would be to upgrade to 2.8.2 once that is released. We'd always build with the old signature and thus support old and new versions but not the ones in the middle (need to verify that we do indeed refer to a method with old signature when building).
Thus, Hive will not support Hadoop 2.8.0 and 2.8.1.
The problem is if we release something referring to the new signature soon (or have already). We might need 2.2.1 and 2.3.1 if these were built against Hadoop 2.8.0/1, as far as I understand cc [~owen.omalley] [~pxiong]]
