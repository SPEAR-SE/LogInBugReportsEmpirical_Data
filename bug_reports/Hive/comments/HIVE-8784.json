[Hive (see generateJDOFilterOverPartitions in org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.parser.ExpressTree) is currently using some DN string functions (substring, indexOf) to get the value for a partitionKey. Actually there is a straightforward way (as implemented in this patch) to get it which in addition avoids the DN indexOf issue with postgresql.

The test cases provided in this patch have been tested against various DB including Derby, Mysql and PostgreSQL etc., Patch is posted on RB and requesting for the review, see https://reviews.apache.org/r/27737/ , thanks.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12680221 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Add more test cases using orm and directsql., +1 looks good to me.  Wonder if [~sershe] has any comment on this?, Rename HIVE-8784_1.patch to HIVE-8784.1.patch to enable pre-commit test., +1, using values.get was mentioned in HIVE-4888, back then the DN version was too old. We should be good now I hope :), Reattaching same patch to trigger another build.  Build machine was down.,
