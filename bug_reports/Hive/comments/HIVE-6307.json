[Thanks for the clarification, [~eugene.koifman].  Please review this new description:

.bq  A string representing completed status of the process launched by the Launcher task. For example when a MapReduce job is submitted via WebHCat, the Launcher invokes a "hadoop jar" command and then when that process exits the completed string is set to "done". Note that this is not the same as the job status (see status).

It's got a run-on sentence that could use further tweaking.  Here's the link with full formatting:

* [GET jobs/:jobid Results |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/WebHCat+Reference+Job#WebHCatReferenceJob-Results], +1, I marked this as "Done" instead of "Fixed" because no code was checked in.  And I left "Fix Version" empty because the wiki isn't tied to any release.  (But it could be marked as a fix for 0.13.0 to include it in the release notes.), The fix version (if any) should be something way earlier than 13.  We didn't change the behavior here, just made the doc more clear about what the behavior is.]
