[The issue is two fold:
# The code is not disciplined about ordering the access to the TXNS and HIVE_LOCKS tables, this needs to be fixed
# Per the [mysql documentation | https://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/5.0/en/innodb-deadlocks.html], even when tables are accessed in the right order deadlocks can be seen due to row locking issues and thus the application should always be ready to re-start the transaction.  This is observed in the TxnManager.lock function when two clients are obtaining locks at the same time., [~rhbutani] This needs to be included in Hive 0.13, Ran tests locally, all looks good., [~alangates] Can you create RB entry for this ?, Review board entry created, https://reviews.apache.org/r/19735/, It should be noted that this looks like I rewrote large sections of the code, but I did not.  Each public method was wrapped in a try/catch block to handle deadlocks and retry.,
