[Yes there s an ambiguity in the grammar. 
The dfa for the groupingSetExpression chooses to interpret the '((tab1.a, tab1.b))' as 
'((tab1.a), (tab1.b))' and so it complains that the ')' is missing.

In the case of '((a, tab1.b))' the dfa chooses the right path.

The fix is to add Syntactic predicate for this rule., Should this be documented in the wiki?

* [GROUPING SETS clause |https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Enhanced+Aggregation%2C+Cube%2C+Grouping+and+Rollup#EnhancedAggregation,Cube,GroupingandRollup-GROUPINGSETSclause], My 2 cents would be: no. This is a bug. Should get fixed. 
Documenting every bug and then updating when we fix, would be asking too much...
, That's music to my ears.  Thanks., I don't know if my issue is identical to this one or just very closely related, but I can recreate the same error with the following query:
{code}
select a, left(b,5), count(1) from temp_table
group by a, left(b,5)
grouping sets 
((left(b,5),a))
{code}
The error does not occur if I just switch the order of the two elements in the grouping set:
{code}
select a, left(b,5), count(1) from temp_table
group by a, left(b,5)
grouping sets 
((a,left(b,5))) 
{code}
The error occurs whenever the LEFT function is not the very last element in its grouping set. The error also occurs when I replace LEFT with other functions., Some more failing examples are present on the HIVE-7178 JIRA that was marked dupe of this., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
