[The comment about "-libjars" above is wrong.
When WebHCat is configured to auto-ship Sqoop tar file, the user/admin may place any necessary JDBC jars into an HDFS directory.  Then use "libdir" param when making the REST call to supply this directory path.  WebHCat will then make sure that the jars from this dir are are placed in lib/ of the exploded Sqoop tar on the remote node., see TestSqoop group in https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/tests/jobsubmission.conf for some examples]
