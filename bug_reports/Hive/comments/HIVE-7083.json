[https://reviews.apache.org/r/21619/, Thanks for looking into this, [~ashutoshc]. Just for my knowledge, with this patch, would tests still pass on JDK6? Or is JDK6 something that we don't care any more?, As far as I can tell, none of these fixes can make these tests to fail on jdk6. But we can be sure only after running the test suite on jdk6 once everything is fixed for jdk7. Also, to keep in mind none of these changes are in production code, all of these changes are exclusively in test code. So, even if we find some tests fail on jdk6 later, its not because of any changes in production code and thus won't be cause of concern. 
Not sure why ptest didnt paste result here. Pasting from :  http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/234/consoleFull
