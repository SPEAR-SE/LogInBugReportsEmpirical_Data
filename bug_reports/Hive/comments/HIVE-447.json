https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-395

Will upload a patch for this..
, submitting., lgtm +1

but this query is similar to lot of other queries. so why only this query failing? others will fail too at some point of time. may be change all tests?, This makes similar fixes for join15.q, join21.q and join20.q.
