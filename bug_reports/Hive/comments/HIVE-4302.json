[hbutani requested code review of "HIVE-4302 [jira] Fix how RowSchema and RowResolver are set on ReduceSinkOp that precedes PTFOp".

Reviewers: JIRA

create RS RR during genPTFPlan

Currently the RowSchema and RowResolver for the ReduceSinkOp just point to the 'input' Op's structures. This causes issues when input Op's structures are changed during Optimization. See Jira 2340 of a problem.

, Haven't made the change to ColumnPrunerFactory in the patch as 2340 is not resolved yet., ashutoshc has requested changes to the revision "HIVE-4302 [jira] Fix how RowSchema and RowResolver are set on ReduceSinkOp that precedes PTFOp".

  Also, it will be good to have a test-case I had in HIVE-2340
  hive> create table t1 (a1 int, b1 string);
  hive> create table t2 (a1 int, b1 string);
  hive> from (select sum(i) over (), s from over10k) tt insert overwrite table t1 select * insert overwrite table t2 select * ;
  hive> select * from t1 limit 3;
  hive> select * from t2 limit 3;

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:10543 Now that we have gotten rid of having support with ptf operator, is this now redundant?
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:10552 If above statement is correct, than we need to update this comment as well.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:10554 And remove this if block.

  Will add the test

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:10543 No this is not about the having clause for windowing.
  This has to do with the GroupBy RR that can precede window processing. For Having expressions a Aggregation expression is added twice to the RR. This logic is to preserve this. The comment on line 10566 tries to explain what is going on.
