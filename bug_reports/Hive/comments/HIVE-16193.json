[most likely caused by HIVE-15851.  Apparently it no longer throws an exception when the job dies, [~ekoifman] Can you review please?, seems to me like this will revert HIVE-15851, patch 2 removed the blocking call. I will see if I can add a test for it.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12862943 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Couldn't find an easy way to fail the MR job from unit test. But the fix should restore the logic as before - if the job fails, an exception will be thrown from CompactorMR, which will cause Worker to mark that specific compaction entry as failed. , I think this needs to be back ported to 2.x line

+1, Thanks Eugene for the review.

Committed to master, branch-2, branch-2.3 and branch-2.2., [~ekoifman] Can you take a look at the addendum patch to see if the error message is good enough?, LGTM, Committed addendum patch to same branches.]
