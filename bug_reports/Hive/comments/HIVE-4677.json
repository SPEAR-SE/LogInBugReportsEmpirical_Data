[BUG-6228, +1, Why is HCatHadoopShims23.getAddress returning null?  That doesn't seem right., There are 2 versions of TempletonJobTracker in hcatalog, 1 for Hadoop 1 and 1 for Hadoop 2.
Only the one for Hadoop 1 calls this method.

Having 2 versions of the same class is not right and will be take care of in HIVE-4460 (soon) but for now this is how it works.
, Patch checked in., Hi [~ekoifman] and [~alangates] looks like this change broke the build: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/136/console can you please take a look?, Fixed, thanks., This issue has been fixed and released as part of 0.12 release. If you find further issues, please create a new jira and link it to this one.]
