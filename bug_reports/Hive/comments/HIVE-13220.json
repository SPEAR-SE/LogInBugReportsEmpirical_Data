[[~prasanth_j] I'm not sure what the issue is here.

In master, DecimalColumnVector.{set|setElement} check if if input decimal is null and set the noNulls/isNull properly., [~mmccline] DecimalColumnVector.set() is supposed to set isNull[i] like other column vectors. But isNull[i] = false state is not set within DecimalColumnVector. The isNull state is set before actually setting the value in VectorExpressions which is inconsistent with other column vectors. Like in the below branch isNull[i] = false is not set https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/storage-api/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/vector/DecimalColumnVector.java#L120

, Now I understand.  Thanks!, [~mmccline], will this go into 2.1.0? Thanks, [~jcamachorodriguez] Yes, that is the plan.  Although I have a lot on my plate (including the LEFT SEMIJOIN issue we talked about and I haven't circled back to)., Removing 2.1.0 target as issue is not tagged as Critical/Blocker and the RC will be created tomorrow. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., I'm moving this JIRA out of 2.1.1 release as it is not a blocker nor critical for a 2.1.1 RC version., Giving this one back to you.  The DecimalUtil. addChecked changed significantly with the Fast HiveDecimal change.  Not quite sure if there is an issue today.]
