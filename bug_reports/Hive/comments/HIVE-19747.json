[it seems that you are missing the object in the command on which you want to grant privileges. the command should be like this

{code}

 grant all on database `default` to user abc;

{code}, Thanks [~Rajkumar Singh] . I'm checking the syntax here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/SQL+Standard+Based+Hive+Authorization
{noformat}
GRANT role_name [, role_name] ...
TO principal_specification [, principal_specification] ...
[ WITH ADMIN OPTION ];
 
principal_specification
  : USER user
  | ROLE role
{noformat}

and also in authorization_8.q qfile, 

{noformat}
set hive.security.authorization.manager=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.authorization.DefaultHiveAuthorizationProvider;
set hive.security.authorization.enabled=true;
GRANT ALL TO USER hive_test_user;
{noformat}

Do we support such syntax? Should we give syntax error for {{grant all to user abc}} then?
