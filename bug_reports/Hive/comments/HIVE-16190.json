[[~hagleitn], [~ekoifman], could u review it? Thanks., I think this may create an issue for "Insert into T values(...)".  This has very limited support for what it can handle.  This change allows a lot more to get past the parser so think the patch should include some post-parser validation code somewhere, How about function unparseExprForValuesClause in the SemanticAnalyzer? Is that enough to check? Thanks., yes, you're right
