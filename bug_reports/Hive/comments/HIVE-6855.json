[NO PRECOMMIT TESTS 

Updated the mysql scripts., Seems like we also need to update hive-schema-0.14.0.mysql.sql, The transaction tables aren't currently in  hive-schema-0.14.0.mysql.sql because we wanted to figure out a better method than adding them by hand for 0.14., +1, Committed to 0.13 & trunk.]
