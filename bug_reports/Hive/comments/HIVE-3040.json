[hive-exec also includes all of the serde classes, some of which depend on Thrift (e.g. TCTLSeparatedProtocol, DynamicSerDe, etc). If you remove Thrift from hive-exec then you also need to remove these classes and the associated test cases from hive-serde., This should be done in conjunction with HIVE-3017, This issue has also been discussed in HIVE-2424.

I believe there are two main use cases:

* Using Hive without modifications. In this case hive-exec actually simplifies things because users do not need to register additional jars.
* Extending Hive, or integrating with an existing environment. This use case is not supported because the fat jar forces certain dependencies (thrift version for example).

Given that multiple issues have been opened about this "hive-exec fat jar" issue there seems to be a real need to solve this., So what's the current work-around right now?

I'm on CDH-5.5.1-1.cdh5.5.1.p0.11 (hive 1.1.0-cdh5.5.1 jars) and when I schedule a Hive or HiveServer2 step in oozie , it fails based on if the hive-exec jar appears after libthrift (failure) or before (success).
