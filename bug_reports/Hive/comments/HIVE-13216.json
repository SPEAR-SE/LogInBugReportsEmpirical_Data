ATTACHMENT ID: 12791860 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Tez tests failed due to safe mode on the NN. The rest are unrelated., Committed to master and branch-1. Thanks for the review!, Why not put this fix into 2.0.1 release?, It would be possible to add if the current RC is sunk... otherwise, it could be in 2.0.2]
