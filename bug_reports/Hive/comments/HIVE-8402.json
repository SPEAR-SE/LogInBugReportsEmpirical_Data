[In my tests at the moment I only see this after compaction.  I don't know if this is because ORC correctly doesn't push the SARGs when there are only delta files or if something else is causing this., A patch to change orc to not push sargs into the deltas.

And to answer my earlier unknown,  this did only happen when a base was also present.  When there was no base file the sarg was not being written into the options passed to OrcRawRecordMerge (see OrcInputFormat.getReader, around line 1121). , 

{color:green}Overall{color}: +1 all checks pass
