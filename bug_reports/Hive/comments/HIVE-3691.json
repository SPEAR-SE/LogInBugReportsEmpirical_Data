[I had the same problem with IBM JDK 1.6 and I made a patch that fixes the problem. The testcase continues on working on Sun Java. This patch was created against version 0.8.1., Another option is using LinkedHashMap instead of HashMap, it worked on both Sun JDK and IBM JDK as well., the patch file is based on trunk,using LinkedHashMap, [~renata] I think LinkedHashMap is enough to this case, what's your opinion on this?, Bing Li, I think both are ok in this case. If it works in IBM and Sun Java I am happy with either solution., replace HashMap with LinkedHashMap in the test case to avoid different order of the output from different JDKs, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Bing & Renata!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2191 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2191/])
