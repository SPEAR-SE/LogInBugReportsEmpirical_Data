[This happened in hive 0.7.0 as well., Could you upload test queries? CHIF is default input format and I cannot imagine how it's not been noticed., {quote}
CREATE TABLE X (int y);
SELECT avg(y) from X ; 
{quote}

I can make a test case to see if it happens in the test framework but real world it happens quit often., It succeeded with result 'NULL' in trunk., Not sure what trunk uses, maybe hadoop 0.20.2s  or 0.20.2-whatever. But I can reproduce this with apache hadoop 0.20.2 and hive 0.7.0 and hive-0.10.x. I will try trunk. It is probably a bug in 0.20.2, but that is something we support., [~appodictic], where you able to check if this happens with trunk ?
, cat above-comment | sed -e 's/where/were/'
, I just tried on trunk in local mode and it worked. Give me a day to confirm if the functionality is different in distributed/ non local mode., Tried in local mode looks good.]
