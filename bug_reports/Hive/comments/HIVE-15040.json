[Hi [~fpin], I have found similar (maybe same) issue (HIVE-15175).
I had tried the example query with hive.optimize.ppd=false and got 0 as result.

Would you confirm this workaround?, Thanks [~tzenmyo], 

yes, I confirm that after disabling predicate pushdown, I get the correct result (tested on Hive 1.1.0 and 2.0.0)

This is quite concerning, as predicate pushdown is one of the most central feature of any SQL engine...
Disabling it by default on every query might result in an import performance downgrade.

Your issue HIVE-15175 seems to involve partition pruning as well, so i don't think this is the same bug., Sorry, my previous comment is incorrect.
HIVE-15175 is a dup of HIVE-14652, however, I have confirmed the HIVE-14652 patch does not fix this issue.]
