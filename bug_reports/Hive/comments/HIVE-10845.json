[Simple patch. [~hagleitn] - please review., Siddharth, do you want to change variable name killedTasks to killedTasksAttempts, to make it similar to failedTaskAttempts (1 lines above), Thanks for taking a look. Makes sense. Uploading a new patch. I'm leaving the second set of variables unchanged (killed / failed / running).
