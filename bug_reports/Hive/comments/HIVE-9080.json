[To reproduce:
1. Create the test_table as described in test_table.sql
2. LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH './test_table.txt' OVERWRITE INTO test_table;
3. Create the ORC based table as described in orc_table.sql
4. Insert into table orc_table as select * from test_table;
5. Repeat: Insert into table orc_table as select * from test_table;
6. Try to concatenate the two files created for ORC_table:
     alter table orc_table concatenate;

, [~danielil] Thanks for the test case! The issue was related to incorrect updation of file statistics in the presence of complex types. I recently put up a patch in HIVE-9067 that should fix the issue., Fixed by HIVE-9067]
