[Changed constant placeholder to include = sign, removed trailing white space, Code review at https://reviews.apache.org/r/18816/, fix typo, Upload again to try to kick off pre-commit tests, +1, [~thejas] Can you take a look?, The code here is supposed to remove this argument if token file argument is not set, do you know why it is not kicking in this case ? https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/hcatalog/webhcat/svr/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/hcatalog/templeton/tool/LaunchMapper.java#L127
, I think the right fix is to not add this param to add this placeholder to command line arguments, it has not been replaced with a real value.
, I'm not sure I understand what you mean. Can you elaborate? The placeholder is getting substituted or eliminated by the templeton controller job. 

If I run this simple Pig script from WebHCat:

emp = load 'wasbs://ehans1@ehans7.blob.core.windows.net/data/emp_0.dat'; dump emp;

Then I see this in the templeton controller job configuration:

templeton.args   cmd,/c,call,C:\\apps\\dist\\pig-0.12.0.2.0.7.0-1551/bin/pig.cmd,-D__WEBHCAT_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION__=-execute,"emp = load 'wasbs://ehans1@ehans7.blob.core.windows.net/data/emp_0.dat'; dump emp;" 

And I see this in the Pig job configuration for the job spawned by the templeton controller job:

pig.cmd.args    -Dmapreduce.job.credentials.binary=/c:/hdfs/nm-local-dir/usercache/ehans/appcache/application_1395867453549_0007/container_1395867453549_0007_01_000002/container_tokens -execute emp = load 'wasbs://ehans1@ehans7.blob.core.windows.net/data/emp_0.dat'; dump emp; 


, Thanks for the clarification Eric. I thought that the problem was with parsing the command launched from the map task, but looks like this is happening before that. I was worried that having "=" sign could cause problems in other systems, but since the shell never sees this arguement, it is fine.

+1 .
