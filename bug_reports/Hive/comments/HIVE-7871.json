ATTACHMENT ID: 12664180, It seems that from http://wiki.eclipse.org/Jetty/Howto/International_Characters
we should just avoid embedding international characters within a URL and use hexdecimal encoded scheme all together at the client end. i.e. use %HH instead of foreign characters for a reliable setup. Although setting the characterset to UTF-8 at all levels, OS, shell, editor, servers etc in my local environment provides a consistent result with using %HH and seem to fix this issue locally, from the documentation it looks like this practice needs to be avoided all together because the browsers/client apis such are not designed to support this feature., bq.  we should just avoid embedding international characters within a URL and use hexdecimal encoded scheme all together at the client end

Should this be documented?, [~leftylev] I think it will be good to document this which otherwise could be misinterpreted as a webhcat/product issue.

Thanks
