ATTACHMENT ID: 12747946 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~mmccline]: LGTM - +1, Committed to master., (and branch-1), [~mmccline], "Fix Version/s" needs to be set.

Also, I don't see the commit to branch-1 in dev@hive email.  Perhaps there's a typo in the jira number on the commit ... I'll keep looking for it., I meant, I don't see the branch-1 commit on the commits@hive email list -- just master., I see Matt's fix on both branches now. 

Git makes it too easy to commit a fix, but not push it., Thanks [~gopalv].]
