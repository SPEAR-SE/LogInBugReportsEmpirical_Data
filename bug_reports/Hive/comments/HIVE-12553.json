[I wonder if this is an issue specific to the the EMR variant of hive. 
I don't see a table definition by that name  (PARTITION_STATS_VS ) in apache hive codebase. I checked master and branch-1.2 .

cc [~ashutoshc], This table is created in JDBCStatsPublisher.java in 291 line. When JDBCStatsUtils.getCreate("")(in line 290) executes it uses constants containing table name and Primary Key size., The table name should beÂ PARTITION_STATS_V2.]
