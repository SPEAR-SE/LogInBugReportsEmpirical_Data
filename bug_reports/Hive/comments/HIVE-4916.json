[This looks like a good start. If you do not mind can you please name your files .txt., [~appodictic] Will do. I was looking for a way to avoid the pre-commit to run. ".txt" is much better though., Changing name to ".txt", Nevermind. I did not understand that you were trying to avoid pre-commit. Thats fine then name them whatever., FWIW another way to avoid precommit testing is to use the appropiate ALL CAPS properties here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+PreCommit+Patch+Testing, Thanks [~brocknoland] I've added the ALL CAPS prop to all the relevant descriptions. That's really nice to have and much better than fiddling with the name., Committed to tez branch.]
