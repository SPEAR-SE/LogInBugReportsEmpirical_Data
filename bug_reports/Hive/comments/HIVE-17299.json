[I'm not sure if this is a hive issue...it seems you are using some kind of spark (Error: org.apache.spark.sql.execution.QueryExecutionException:)
Could you reproduce the issue using only hive?, Well, as I'm using Hive under Spark, I'm not sure of waht I should do to reproduce the issue, but SerDe is a part of Hive, isn't it ?
Still, if you think the issue isn't related to Hive as an execution engine for data requests I can migrate it to Spark Jira., [~bartimeux] yes...I think if you are using Spark-on-Hive then spark will be in control of the classpath-s so I think they might have better insights about what could possibly go wrong in this case.]
