[Here's a snippet from another failure:

java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Error: type expected at the position 5618 of '[ELIDED]metadata:struct<id:string,original_width:int,original_height:int,background_size:string,filter:string,is_done:boo:bigint:boolean:bigint:string:bigint:bigint:bigint:double:string:bigint:string:int:boolean:string:boolean:boolean:string:string:array<struct<[ELIDED]' but 'boo' is found. at org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.typeinfo.TypeInfoUtils$TypeInfoParser.expect(TypeInfoUtils.java:348) at 

Again, the [ELIDED] is my edit, but the "boo" fragment is present in the original error. Something constructing the type string seems to have probably truncated "boolean". We are constructing a nested `org.apache.spark.sql.types.StructType`, and passing that straight to spark.read.schema(struct), so I'm not sure where the type name is serialized to a string -- but that's probably where the error is.]
