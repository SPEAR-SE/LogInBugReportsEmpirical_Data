[Hey Mohit , thanks for the fix and the test case.  But I am wondering, shouldn't the method still do a set?  Right now it is changed to just return the object?, Thanks for catching that! Updated patch with feedback., So I think this wont work (just transitively assigns), I meant, don't we need to call o.setValue() as it was in the past?  Different method depending on if its a HiveChar and HiveCharWriteable., Hmm, the "o" arg isn't really used anywhere. I assigned to it just to respect the "set" interface. 

In PrimitiveObjectInspectorConverter.HiveCharConverter.convert(), the "hc" arg passed to set() isn't used anywhere.
It returns HiveChar or HiveCharWritable, depending on object inspector:
  HiveCharWritable for WritableHiveCharObjectInspector 
  HiveChar for JavaHiveCharObjectInspector

ATTACHMENT ID: 12664532, Got it, I took a look.  Its very weird code in the other JavaObjInspectors as some other ones do this kind of thing.  Java is pass by value so you cant change outside's reference of 'o' like that, so the assignment does nothing useful, unless I'm mis-understanding something.  

Let's go with the first patch then if that is ok, I left a minor comment on the rb., Thanks for the feedback. Updated patch., +1,
