[Adjusted include/exclude macros to run the correct versions., This is one of those weird cases where hadoop behavior changes in dot release. Currently our shim layer is not well equipped to handle such finer differentiation of hadoop versions, nor should it. e.g., this test will behave differently on 0.23.2 and 0.23.3. Instead of wrestling with hadoop version idiosyncrasies via (IN|EX)CLUDE we should make our tests more robust. My suggestion here will be to delete repair_hadoop23.q entirely and drop (IN|EX)CLUDE macros from repair.q as well. Then, do {{dfs -mkdir ../build/ql/test/data/warehouse/repairtable/p1=a; dfs -mkdir ../build/ql/test/data/warehouse/repairtable/p1=a/p2=a;}} and so on such that we don't need -p option anytime in these testcases. , This patch removes the special hadoop23 test file and rewrites the test as suggested., Agree with Ashutosh.

This patch looks good to me.
