[This patch fixes the issue trivially. , Thanks for catching this issue!

[~dhiraj.kumar]: Do you mind adding a unit test for this case as well, so it will not cause any problems later on?

Thanks,
Peter, This has unit test cases. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12840845 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hi Dhiraj,

Good job with the tests.
It is just nitpicking, but I think it is enough to add the new method (testGetTimestampFromString), and it is not needed to add the same conversion to the test which checks the conversion to timestamps with seconds (testgetTimestampWithSecondsInt).

Sadly our QA framework is not perfect yet. There are flaky tests which we collect under HIVE-15058 like HIVE-15084 "Flaky test: TestMiniTezCliDriver:explainanalyze_2, 3, 4, 5". There are some tests which are failed not because of the change.
Please check the test results with these in mind as described here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToCommit#HowToCommit-PreCommitruns,andcommittingpatches

After this - if there is no related test errors - your patch is ready to be commited (at least, in my opinion).

As I wrote to you in email I am also new to hive. It might be a good idea to ask [~jdere] to review this change, since he was working on the Timestamps lately so he knows this part of code very well.

Thanks for the patch, and the prompt changes.

Peter


, Hello [~pvary], 

I am removing extraneous test case. Agree that testGetTimestampFromString is sufficient to unit test the change. 

[~jdere] can you please review the change? 

--Dhiraj,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12840893 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Can you add a .q test so we can see this fix work in a SQL statement (such as the example you give in description)? Would be good to have a test to confirm your use case is fixed., Added the .q test.,

cc [~ashutoshc], Am I right when I think we should remove the "Incompatible change" Hadoop Flag?

Thanks,
Peter

+1 for the patch (non-binding), It was put from the perspective of result being incompatible with hive 1.2 version. But since we agree that it is a bug, it is no longer "Incompatible change". 

, Committed to master. Thanks Dhiraj!, Problem still exist if empty string is provided.


query:select cast("2016-12-31 12:00:00" as timestamp) <> ''
expected result:true
actual result:NULL, [~xupeng1226]
Shouldn't "" be treated as a null timestamp ? A comparison with null would return NULL. That is SQL semantics.
