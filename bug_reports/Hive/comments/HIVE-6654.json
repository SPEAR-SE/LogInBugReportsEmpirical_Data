[Simple test case for reproducing the issue. 

The queries on the table runs in 0.8 seconds, while the map task takes 1.4 seconds even on a 50kb input., Views are regarded as sub-queries and current simple fetch optimizer does not accept those, which seemed to be harsh. I'll take look at this later.]
