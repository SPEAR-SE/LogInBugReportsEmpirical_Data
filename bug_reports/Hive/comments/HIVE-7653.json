[HIVE-7653.1.patch uses a map to store schemas for which Type has been processed already.
If they have been processed already, it uses the processed result, thus preventing an infinite loop.

To see the infinite loop, comment following line in SchemaToTypeInfo.java:
{code}
schemaSeenMap.put(schema, primitiveTypeToTypeInfo.get(Schema.Type.NULL));
{code}

ATTACHMENT ID: 12660923, Re-attaching the patch as the build problem seems to be resolved now., [~davidzchen], [~sushanth] I see you have good experience with AvroSerDe as per your contribution to HIVE-4329

[~swarnim], [~xuefuz], I see that you guys have also contributed a good deal on HIVE-6147 and have also faced a problem similar to the one I am facing.

Could you please review this patch as well?
This is my first patch to HIVE and no one has responded to my review request till now.
So I am trying to directly request some experienced folks.
Your review and comments will be much appreciated.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12665548, Adding a dummy patch to see if the tests are still failing., [~sachingoyal] Once you are happy with the patch, would you mind opening a review for this? Thanks!, Cancelling current patch and trying a dummy one to see if tests still fail for it, Dummy patch with right naming scheme., Thank you [~swarnim],   I am trying a dummy patch (with no logical changes).
I will update the patch with a valid one once tests have run for this dummy patch.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12666574, [~swarnim], I have verified that dummy patch is not failing the test.
So the problem must be with the actual patch HIVE-7653.5.patch
I have seen the test in my local installation and built it too but it is not failing.
I have verified that there are no more local changes on my side than the attached patch.
Also my branch is fully updated.
Still the test fails when submitting the patch.

So, if you can help me figure out why this one test above is failing, it would be great and much appreciated.
I am using following command to build:
{code}
mvn clean install -Phadoop-2,dist
{code}
, [~sachingoyal] Is the failing test somehow related to the changes that you are proposing with the patch?, The patch is for AvroSerDe and is about handling circular references in schema even though Avro allows it.

Fix is not too complicated:
Add a lookup to store every type while AvroSerDe is processing a given schema.
If a given type is seen again, it it used from the lookup thus preventing an infinite loop.

Since this was a missing feature in AvroSerDe, I don't see how my patch is failing a test and that too which is passing on my local.
So I don't think it is related to my patch., Hi Sachin, thanks for the patch.  I put some comments/questions on the review board., Thank you [~szehon], I have incorporated the comments and attached a new patch., I almost forgot this one by now :)

Thanks,  pending tests on the new patch. +1, [~szehon], I have included a test in the patch.
Do you mean the Jenkins tests run by [~hiveqa]?, Attaching again to trigger HiveQA,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12699152 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The above two test failures have absolutely nothing to do with this patch.
Here are the logs I have seen:

[~szehon], could you help me find the issue here?, Yea the test failures dont look related.  Committed to trunk, thanks for the contribution., Thank you [~szehon]!
Appreciate your time on reviewing this.]
