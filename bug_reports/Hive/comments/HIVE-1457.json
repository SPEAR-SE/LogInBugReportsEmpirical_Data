[One example which came up today

----

Hi,
 I have a custom UDF which takes as an argument an array of bools.  But when I call this UDF I get this error:

FAILED: Error in semantic analysis: line 3:19 Wrong Arguments 0: No matching method for class UDFWhich with (array<boolean>). Possible choices: _FUNC_(array<boolean>)

 Which makes no sense to me since those two things look equal to me.  Here's my query:

ADD JAR /home/jonchang/projects/data/lib/udf/fb_udf.jar;
CREATE TEMPORARY FUNCTION WHICH AS 'UDFWhich';
select which(array(true, false)) from tmp_jonchang_hive_test;

Cheers,
Jonathan, One from Dennis

This suddenly started happening, after I just added a couple of arrays in my UDAF code and rebuilt the JAR ... the Hive query that had worked before suddenly now reports the following error.

Does this NoSuchMethodException on "J.<init>" ring any bells for anyone?  (I searched the Hive mail list and didn't see any old mentions of this ....).  I.e. what is it a symptom of?

Resolution:

Nevermind .... I had accidentally added one of my newly introduced vector declares as "long foo[];" instead of "long[] foo;" -- and it created the JAR fine.   So just a silly Java programming/typo error ...
