[This issue is because of using wrong schema when process the split.

In getSchema function of AvroGenericRecordReader.java, if a partition is the prefix of a split, it will use schema of this partition to parse the split, but this is not always correct.

For example, partition '/user/hadoop/tpc-h/data/part' is the prefix of '/user/hadoop/tpc-h/data/partsupp/good_2013-01_partsupp_tbl_0002.avro', but we can not use the schema of '/user/hadoop/tpc-h/data/part' to parse '/user/hadoop/tpc-h/data/partsupp/good_2013-01_partsupp_tbl_0002.avro'

In my opinion, if a partition is the path parent of a split, we can use this partition's schema to parse the split. , This has been a recurring problem.  The code to figure out what schema goes where has been problematic and the information passed to the mapper has changed from Hive version to Hive version.  Using the parent may not always get the latest schema, yes?, So could you please give me an example that parent can not get the latest schema?, I have just found with the same problem. Is there a workaround? Will it be solved in any version?]
