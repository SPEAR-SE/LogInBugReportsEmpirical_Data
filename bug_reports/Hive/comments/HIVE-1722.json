[I found the reason is because "set hive.mapjoin.cache.numrows=100" .
Without this config statement, the result is 1114788.0, which is correct., The root cause of this bug is as same as hive-1723 [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-1723]
"set hive.mapjoin.cache.numrows=100" will make the test case query to use jdbm files, which will hit the bug in hive-1723., I resolve this bug in hive-1641, This bug is resolved in Hive-1641]
