[Hi Brock,

   The Usage of create table with both stored as and like keyword is not supported in hive. The purpose of like
is to create table like the original with same definition, so we cannot use stored as with like as it will change the definition.

Thanks,
Prabhu Joseph, Hi Prabhu,

I think we could support this, if we wrote the code to do so.
