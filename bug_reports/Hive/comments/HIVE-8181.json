ATTACHMENT ID: 12689432 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks for the updated tests [~navis]!

I'm trying to figure out some of the EWAH results in the updates. I'm not sure about the results in the update

array(8, ...) and array(13, ...) should be array(13, ...) right?


, [~gopalv] I think I've misunderstood the argument of theses functions. I thought (13,2,4,8589934592,4096,0) is index of a bitset, which is not. Scratch the patch. Sorry., No worries [~navis]. Thanks for the effort., [~navis]: reassigned to you - I was just going to update the golden files and get this in, but looks like you've optimized a significant chunk of code with the bitmap impl.,
