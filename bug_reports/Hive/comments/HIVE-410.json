[ping?, Still investigating this. Will update this week., The fix is quite simple. I have not been able to add a test case yet as I need miniMR for that. If this goes in before miniMR stuff, I will add a test case in a separate JIRA.
, 1. Why did you increase the max memory from 256 to 512 m ?
2. Instead of hard coding 5 minutes, can you make it a function of map reduce timeout (10 minutes in the above note), Added code to parameterize this based on the expiry interval in map reduce.

I had to bump the memory for junit as our tests intermittently fail with out of memory exception otherwise. Looks like we are operating near the 256m limit.
, +1 
looks good - will commit once the tests pass, Committed. Thanks Ashish]
