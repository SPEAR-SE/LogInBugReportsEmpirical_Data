[Hadoop to pass hadoop.version and hadoop.security.version explicitly. Could compile against 0.23 alone by running:
ant clean package -Dshims.include=0.23 -Dhadoop.version=0.23.0
-Dhadoop.security.version=0.23.0, This should be enough:

{{ant clean package -Dshims.include=0.23 -Dhadoop.version=0.23.0}}

Since you are only compiling the .23 shim other Hadoop versions won't be fetched and you need to specify hadoop.version to compile the common code.
