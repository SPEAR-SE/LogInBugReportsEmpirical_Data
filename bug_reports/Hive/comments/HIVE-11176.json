[Looks like a duplicate, please test with the HIVE-11051 fix and confirm, yep 1.3.0 latest build has resolved this issue, but the core code problem remains,
, Unreachable code: 
hive/serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/objectinspector/StandardStructObjectInspector.java
// With Data
@Override
@SuppressWarnings("unchecked")
public Object getStructFieldData(Object data, StructField fieldRef) {
if (data == null)
{ return null; }
// We support both List<Object> and Object[]
// so we have to do differently.
boolean isArray = ! (data instanceof List);
if (!isArray && !(data instanceof List)) { return data; }

*************************
The if condition above translates to 
if(!true && true) the code section cannot be reached,
, Trivial fix, +1,
