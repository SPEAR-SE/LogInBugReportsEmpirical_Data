[This fix should be applied to hive-schema-3.0.0 as well so that is lands in Hive 3.0.1, Yes, hive-schema-3.0.0.postgres.sql has the same issue. Thanks Alan!, +1.Â  Assuming it passes the ITestPostgres in standalone-metastore I don't think there's any reason to wait for a nightly run as this change won't be tested by the nightly run., ITestPostgres pass. Patch pushed to master/branch-3/branch-3.0. Thanks Alan for review!, This is released in Hive 3.1.0.]
