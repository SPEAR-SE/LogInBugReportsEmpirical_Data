ATTACHMENT ID: 12666116, [~ashutoshc] & [~navis], can either of you review or add appropriate reviewers for this patch?

Also i ran the 2 tests that failed above locally and they passed. Thanks., LGTM +1 cc: [~thejas], +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Pala!, > This is a regression from 0.12

Should this bug in 0.13.0 & 0.13.1 be documented in the wiki?

* [DDL -- Create Table Like | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-CreateTableLike], Ping.  Does this need a TODOC14 label?, For Hive 14 this need not be documented since this just restores a functionality that regressed in between. 

For Hive 13 documentation, i am not sure what's the criteria for bugs to be mentioned in regular documentation., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
