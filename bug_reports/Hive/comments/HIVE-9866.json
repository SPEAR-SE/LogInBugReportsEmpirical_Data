[A simple strategy, invalidate the stats for the changed column., Thanks [~damien.carol] for the comment. It is also the solution I thought. I am working on a fix for both this JIRA and HIVE-9720. AlterTable needs also update the entries in  TAB_COL_STATS/PART_COL_STATS., Patch to HIVE-9720 has been submitted and requested for review. It should include the fix to this issue reported in this JIRA., A patch to HIVE-9720 which has been committed to trunk also includes the fix to this issue. Resolve this JIRA, This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
