[They are both valid splits, so unlikely to need changes there - the only issue is with external consumption of those details, like using those values as hashcode inputs.

We could implement a hashcode directly out of ORC though., They are valid splits - however, it should be possible to make them consistent when splits are generated by ORC itself. Either special case BI or ETL to generate the same split as the other for the starting split of a file.

In terms of hashCode for consistent splits - that should be independent of the format., I'm moving this JIRA out of 2.1.1 release as it is not a blocker nor critical for a 2.1.1 RC version. Feel free to commit it to branch 2.1 if the patch is ready before the release.]
