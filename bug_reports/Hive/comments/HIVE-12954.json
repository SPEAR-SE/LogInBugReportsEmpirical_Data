[This also appears to be in Hive 1.0. The closely related 'split' function does handle NULL transparently, without an NPE., Added patch for fix the NPE exception in the str_to_map when running it with null string and created unit test for GenericUDFStringToMap.
The problem was that in the GenericUDFStringToMap.evaluate method it was not checked whether the input text is null, just called a split on the text. If the text was null, a NPE occurred.
A NPE can also occur if the delimiter strings are null. If either of them is null, it should fall back to the default delimiters., Review is created and linked. Please review the patch.,
