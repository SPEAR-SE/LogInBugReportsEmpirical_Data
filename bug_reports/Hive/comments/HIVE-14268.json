[Patch attached., Slightly more complex version in .2.patch, with thrift change to allow signalling on the event as to whether this is an overwrite event or not (although we still don't use that info on the metastore side for now), [~alangates], could you please review? (We can go with either approach), Given that there's no use for the replace information on the server, for now I say we go with patch 1.  If we find some use for propagating that information in the future we can add it to thrift then.

+1 for patch 1., Sounds good - reuploading .1.patch as .3.patch so the tests run on that., reuploading .1/.3.patch as .4.patch because the builds.apache.org job borked and is not picking it up again.,
