ATTACHMENT ID: 12667613, This corresponds to the following CVE

{noformat}
-----BEGIN PGP SIGNED MESSAGE-----
Hash: SHA512

CVE-2014-0228: Apache Hive Authorization vulnerability

Severity: Moderate

Vendor: The Apache Software Foundation

Versions affected: Apache Hive 0.13.0

Users affected: Users who have enabled SQL standards based authorization mode.

Description:
In SQL standards based authorization mode, the URIs used in Hive
queries are expected to be authorized on the file system permissions.
However, the directory used in import/export statements is not being
authorized. This allows a user who knows the directory to which data
has been exported to import that data into his table. This is possible
if the user HiveServer2 runs as has permissions for that directory and
its contents.

Mitigation: Users who use SQL standards based authorization should
upgrade to 0.13.1.

Credit: This issue was discovered by Thejas Nair of Hortonworks.

{noformat}, Looks good, just one thing can you fix ExportSemanticAnalyzer to use the new isLocalFile() method you added? It currently does this to check if it's a local file URI:

{code}
    outputs.add(new WriteEntity(parentPath, toURI.getScheme().equals("hdfs")));
