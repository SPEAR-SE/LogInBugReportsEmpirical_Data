[Usual practice is to first commit on master and then do backports. Would you like to put up a patch against master?, @ashutosh, we are still on branch-1, so I had this patch readily available for branch-1. There was a bit of work to get HIVE-13989, which this depends on, ported to master.

Patches are available for master and branch-1 now., [~cnauroth] Are there any new apis that might help in checking if ACL is enabled in the FS ?
, At the very least, I think we should cache the information that ACL is not supported after the UnsupportedException is thrown. Otherwise, it could end up being very expensive to deal with that exception for every file check.
, Fair comment [~thejas]. Let me review the patch to see where this can be cached.

In Hadoop-2.6 (when we first encountered this) I was informed that there was no way of asking the NN for this information., [~thejas], is this possibly a duplicate of HIVE-9182?  There was an uncommitted patch on that one.  During code review for that patch, I gave feedback that you can avoid {{getAclStatus}} calls by checking {{FsPermission#getAclBit}}.  For any {{FileSystem}} that doesn't implement ACLs, the ACL bit will always be false.  I expect this would work for all {{FileSystem}} implementations and avoid tight coupling to HDFS server-side configuration.  I think the same feedback applies here.]
