[I am able to reproduce this locally on ubuntu box as well as a rhel box., It will be great if someone can verify that this indeed is failing in their environment too to rule out the possibility that this is something related to my environment., TestMTQueries fails for me too., Thanks a lot Navis for picking this up. Since usually we dont commit unless all unit tests pass, getting this corrected will unblock other patches to get committed. , https://reviews.facebook.net/D4437

It's from HIVE-1653 and verified (only) tests in it., [~namitjain] Since you worked on HIVE-1653 you will have better context. Can you review and commit this one?, [~navis] can you also upload the patch on jira? Phabricator doesnt have an option to download a patch. , I will take a look, +1, Committed. Thanks Navis, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1578 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1578/])
