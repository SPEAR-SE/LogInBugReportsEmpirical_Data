[Note that something crazy like

ON a.key=b.key OR a.key IS NULL AND b.key IS NULL

actually does allow null values to meet the join condition, so it's not just a matter of filtering them out before joining.
, That's a good use case to consider.

I believe Hive currently does not support that (the condition after ON has to be conjunctive), but it's good to keep it in mind.
, This seems to be a duplicate of HIVE-741. , Closing as dup.
