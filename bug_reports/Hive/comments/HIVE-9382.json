[The second run for the query in fact turns off Global Limit optimization. That's why it doesn't continue on and on., The problem happens when there are already 10 rows fetched and output (in this example), and the FetchTask still tries to retrieve more rows since the least number of rows for each task is greater than 0. That is wrong, because we do not need any more rows. FetchTask.fetch should just return without doing anything., Uploaded 1st patch., Here's how to reproduce the problem:
{code:sql}
set hive.limit.optimize.enable=true;
set hive.limit.optimize.limit.file=2;
set hive.limit.row.max.size=100;
set hive.fetch.task.conversion=none;

create table t1 (key int, value string) stored as textfile;
load data local inpath '../../data/files/srcbucket20.txt' INTO TABLE t1;
load data local inpath '../../data/files/srcbucket20.txt' INTO TABLE t1;
load data local inpath '../../data/files/srcbucket20.txt' INTO TABLE t1;

select * from t1 limit 1;
{code},
