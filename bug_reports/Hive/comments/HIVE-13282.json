[This is targeting 2.0.1 but has no patch. Should it be moved out to 2.1.0?, Yes. We can move this out to 2.1.0. This only happens in case of reduce side SMB in tez. We have a simple workaround right now that will address this (disable smb join in this case). The real fix would take a lot of refactoring the code which is more suited for master than a maintenance release., [~vikram.dixit] I have attached a Q where I attempt to repro the problem but I can't seem to coax the Optimizer to do an Sorted Merge Bucket Map Join Operator...., [~mmccline] Can you try the patch I have attached above? I think that is how I was able to repro the issue. I think with the patch attached here, it produces a result sometimes but that is wrong (if you switch around the tables, it may even throw an exception)., Work-In-Progress.

Changed GroupByOperator.process to ignore the tag and just use 0.  This is what was causing the ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException.  Is this the correct solution here?

Also, experimented with deferring close on the SMBMapJoinOperator and CommonMergeJoinOperator (Tez) until all the parents have closed.  This produces wrong results for the ORDER BY query (0 instead of 480) and the new GROUP BY query (0 instead of ???) in tez_smb_1.q, Removing 2.1.0 target as issue is not tagged as Critical/Blocker and the RC will be created tomorrow. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., [~vikram.dixit] Is this patch still needed for 2.1.1? We're looking to release an RC this or next week., No, this patch is not needed for 2.1.1, [~mmccline] I'm wondering about the status of this issue. I saw a similar backtrace

{code}, Vikram had worked on it.  I took over.  There were 2 issues I recall.  One was the index out of bounds but when that was fixed another issue wrong results appeared.  It had to do with handling of operator close when there are multiple parents.  I wasn't able to work that one very well., [~mmccline] Is it ok to target for 1.3 and remove target 1.2.2 (minor release)?, Removing target 1.2.2. [~mmccline] feel free to add it back if you feel this is a must have in 1.2.2, [~mmccline], will this go into 2.2.0? Thanks, Probably not., Attempting to rebase...]
