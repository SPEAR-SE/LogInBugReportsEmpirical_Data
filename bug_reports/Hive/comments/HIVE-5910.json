[Should this be moved to HIVE project ?, my bad... did not notice the project when I created it... It has been moved to hive. Thanks for letting me know, Ted :), Nice catch.  These two config properties need to be documented in hive-default.xml.template and the wiki:  [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties]., [~leftylev] Actually, these two are MapReduce configurations. Seems these two are internally used in Hive. I am not sure if we need to add them to add them to our conf template., D'oh!  Thanks for setting me straight., One more thing:  these params are deprecated.  The earliest mention I've found is in 
MAPREDUCE-3952 (early 2012) affecting versions 0.24.0 and 0.23.3:

Apparently the deprecation was in effect for Hadoop 0.20:  [https://groups.google.com/a/cloudera.org/forum/#!msg/cdh-user/Xo-Rh9CRcpQ/o6feBnIg63cJ].

It's documented for Hadoop 2.2.0 here:  [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/DeprecatedProperties.html].  , Fixed via HIVE-6572]
