[Looks like this error is occurring because the function is handling the timestamps as timestamps in the local timezone, though the function says that the timestamp is to be treated as having either UTC (from_utc_timestamp()) or the input timezone (to_utc_timestamp())., Patch to fix issue by parsing timestamp string with DateFormat to use correct timezone, and also using DateFormat to convert to timestamp string of destination timezone.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12778614 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures do not look related, [~thejas][~ashutoshc] would either of you be able to review?, From bug description, it seems problem is also for to_ts() but changes are only in from_ts() Do those changes cover both cases?, GenericUDFToTimestamp derives from GenericUDFFromTimestamp, only difference being whether to invert the from/to timezones. So fixing GenericUDFFromTimestamp fixes the behavior for both functions., +1 LGTM, Committed to branch-1/branch-2.0/master, [~jdere] Could you let me know how to reproduce this issue? It seems these functions work as expected with the code without this patch. I am investigating a similar issue HIVE-14161 and wonder if it is related or not. Thanks , I noticed you already commented in HIVE-14161 about difference between EST vs America/New_York, but I think the case was similar here as well, the time zone had to be a timezone that actually switches during DST (like America/New_York) to see the issue., There is still a bug in this - from_utc_timestamp() is interpreting a GMT timestamp with DST. 

HS2 on PST timezone:
GMT timestamp                       PST timestamp                       PST 2GMT
2012-03-11 01:30:15.332	2012-03-10 17:30:15.332	2012-03-11 01:30:15.332
2012-03-11 02:30:15.332	2012-03-10 19:30:15.332	2012-03-11 03:30:15.332 (<--- We got 1 hour more on GMT)

PSTtimestap is generated using from_utc_timestamp('2012-03-11 02:30:15.332', 'PST') 
PST2GMT timestamp is generated using to_utc_timestamp(from_utc_timestamp('2012-03-11 02:30:15.332', 'PST'), 'PST'), Will report this as new issue]
