[Patch which fixes the grammar., +1

you mean this worked:
{noformat}
 select max(i) over (w) from over100k window w as partition by f;
{noformat}
Remember putting the parenthesis because there was an ambiguity, don't remember what it was; 
I checked now with your changes, there is no ambiguity
, Yeah thats correct. The query you had it is the one which worked. 
Patch checked in the branch.]
