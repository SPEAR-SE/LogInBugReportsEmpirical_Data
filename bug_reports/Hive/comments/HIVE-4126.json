[hbutani requested code review of "HIVE-4126 [jira] remove support for lead/lag UDFs outside of UDAF args".

Reviewers: JIRA, ashutoshc

remove support for lead/lag UDFs outside of UDAF args

Select Expressions such as
p_size - lead(p_size,1)
are currently handled as non aggregation expressions done after all over clauses are evaluated.
Once we allow different partitions in a single select list(Jira 4041), these become ambiguous.

	the equivalent way to do such things is either to use lead/lag UDAFs with expressions ( support added with Jira 4081)
	stack windowing clauses with inline queries. select lead(r,1).. from (select rank() as r....)...

To: JIRA, ashutoshc, hbutani
, ashutoshc has commented on the revision "HIVE-4126 [jira] remove support for lead/lag UDFs outside of UDAF args".

  Changes look good. But following query in windowing_expressions.q fails
  select p_mfgr, p_retailprice, p_size,
  rank() as r,
   lag(rank(),1) as pr,
  sum(p_retailprice) as s2 over (rows between unbounded preceding and current row),
  sum(p_retailprice) - 5 as s1 over (rows between unbounded preceding and current row)
  from part
  distribute by p_mfgr
  sort by p_retailprice;

  Looks like need to update the query.

INLINE COMMENTS
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/SemanticAnalyzer.java:10137 Do we need to update this comment blocks. Function now does lot less than whats in comment. We probably need to update comments of other functions as well.
