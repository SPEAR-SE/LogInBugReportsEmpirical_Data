ATTACHMENT ID: 12645915, NIce catch.  Fortunately the Hive build is running all tests individually so its not hitting this issue, but this affects devs trying to run unit-tests outside /itests.  [~prasanth_j] was that pom change committed by mistake ?, Oops! My bad. That was a mistake. I added that to run unit test locally in my environment. I forgot to revert that while committing. Sorry for the inconvenience. [~davidzchen] thanks for catching it!, +1, Committed to trunk. Thanks David!, can we  commit this back to 0.13.1 branch as well? hive 13.1 checkout doesn't run tests either., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
