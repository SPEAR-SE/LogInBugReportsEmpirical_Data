[Simple patch fixes the two instances of this I found in SemanticAnalyzer.  I'm not wild about taking the message and making it the new exception's message, rather than just completely wrapping the original, but this is consistent with other uses in the file.  This is a simple change, so I've not included tests, but did verify the new code while debugging a separate issue., +1 Running tests., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Jakob!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #1193 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/1193/])
