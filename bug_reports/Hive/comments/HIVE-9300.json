[[~brocknoland]/[~ashutoshc] can someone take a look?
, Thank you [~prasanth_j]! LGTM but can we remove the re-ordering of the imports in {{HiveConf}}? I don't see a need for that?, Thats import order difference between IntelliJ vs Eclipse.. I will see if IntelliJ can be configured to follow eclipse import order., Updated to fix import ordering difference., +1 pending tests

Thank you Prasanth!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12690665 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thank you Prasanth! I have committed your contribution to trunk!, Doc note:  This adds *hive.metastore.thrift.compact.protocol.enabled* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the wiki.

Should it be mentioned in Metastore Administration as well as Configuration Properties?

* [Metastore Administration | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AdminManual+MetastoreAdmin]
* [Configuration Properties -- Metastore | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-MetaStore], Yeah. Will be good to have it in both places.]
