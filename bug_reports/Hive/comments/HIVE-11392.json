[[~jdere] This seems to be an issue. We should return the result always since the trailing space is not important during the comparison, right?, What's going on here is that in Hive, string literals (like '1 '), are of type String, not of type char. This affects how the comparison is being done.

Char-to-String comparisons result in the values being converted to the common type between the two types (string).
So cast('1' as char(4)) = cast('1 ' as string) ends up looking like cast('1' as string) = cast('1 ' as string). For String (as well as varchar), trailing spaces  is significant during comparison which is why you do not see any results with that predicate.

As you noticed, the char-to-char comparison shows the correct results (cast('1' as char(4)) compares as equal to cast('1 ' as char(4))

If string literals were treated as being of type char like they are in other databases, we would see the expected behavior, but strings/string literals came first and we might be stuck with that behavior, as changing that would mean a lot of changes in Hive behavior., Got it. Thanks Jason.]
