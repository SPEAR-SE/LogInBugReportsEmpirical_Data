[FYI, I tried this with ORC format and it works fine. It seems to be Parquet specific issue.
, Would  you like to look into this [~Ferd] [~dongc] [~xuefuz] ?
, cc: [~spena], Thanks [~thejas] to get me involved. I can take a look at this after 2-3 weeks since I will take a leave next week. Feel free to assign to someone else if he has interests working on this., Hey [~kamrul], you're looking for Parquet PPD issues. This is one that has incorrect results. Would you like to take a look a it?, Tested in upstream for the queries which return incorrect results:
{code}
hive> set hive.optimize.index.filter=true;
hive> set hive.optimize.ppd.storage=true;
hive> select count(*) from t where c between '2015-12-09' and '2015-12-11';

hive> select count(*) from t where c between '2015-12-10' and '2015-12-10';
OK
1
{code}
After disabling the hive.compute.query.using.stats, these queries also return the correct result. Somehow the issue has been fixed., It might be related to HIVE-13039. [~nbrenwald], could you try Hive 1.3.0 or 2.1.0 to see if you can reproduce the issue?, [~nbrenwald] I am resolving this JIRA since it has been fixed in Hive 2.1.0 and 1.3.0 in HIVE-13039.]
