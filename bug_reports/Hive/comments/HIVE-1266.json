[Discussed with Namit, and the idea here is to generate a probe pruner expr to see if the partition predicate has effect or not.
The method to generate the probe pruner expr is to 1) set the partition predicate to be always false, 2) set non-partition predicate always be true. 

For example, 
"ds='2009' or key>20" will "false or true", and the result will be true. So the partition predicate has no effect.
, The patch does not apply cleanly.]
