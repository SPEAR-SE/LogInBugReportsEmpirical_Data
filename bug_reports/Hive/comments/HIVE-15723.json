[Patch 01. trying to see if it causes any diffs in golden files (shouldn't, session stats warnings are behind off-by-default conf var), 02.patch adds a conf setting hive.cbo.show.warnings (default false) to control the logging of misisng columns and a test case. Missing stats warnings looks like this:

{noformat}
No Stats for default@missing_stats_t1, Columns: value
No Stats for default@missing_stats_t2, Columns: key
No Stats for default@missing_stats_t3, Columns: value
{noformat}

Which is exactly the same output as the missing stats logged (to hive.log) in RelOpHiveTable.updateColStats, as is actually the very same logMsg., RB https://reviews.apache.org/r/56025/, Instead of using thread locals to store messages, can we just print message right when we know about them at {{RelOptHiveTable}} You may get instance of console there via SessionState.getConsole(), Reason to avoid thread-locals is in multi-threaded HS2, we need to be very careful with them otherwise we may have leaks. So, we tend to avoid them unless there is no other way around it.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12849937 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, +1 [~rusanu] you may address [~pvary] review comments on RB while committing the patch., Sorry, actually fatthumbed on it on my mobile :) , 04.patch with Yetus warnings addressed, [~pvary] Hi Peter, is there an easy way I can run Yetus on a patch locally so I can test it before upload?, [~rusanu]: Currently you would need too many small patches to make it work. It is not committed yet. (See: HIVE-15051)

What you can do is use HIVE-15725, and run the command which runs the yetus checkstyle check:
{code}
cd ql
mvn checkstyle:checkstyle -Dcheckstyle.consoleOutput=true -DskipTests -Pitests -Ptest-patch 
{code}

Yetus found no other error in your patch.

Thanks,
Peter, hive.cbo.show.warnings should be set to to 'true' by default, since the user may not really know if he is missing statistics and may not even look for this setting. I couldn't reopen the bug. , 05.patch changes default to true,
