[Looks like it comes from Parquet code assuming MR only?

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/io/parquet/write/ParquetRecordWriterWrapper.java#L49, It's not obvious what the proper thing to do in this case is. The existing ID could be parsed and reformatted, or Tez could be modified to generate TaskAttemptID-compatible identifiers. I have created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-1104 to track the issue on that end., I mistakenly assumed that code came from TEZ, when it in fact exists in Hive...

https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/022ee59b8cb9161996310861d4fbf59801d4b9fe/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/exec/tez/TezProcessor.java#L103

Should probably be:

{noformat}
StringBuilder taskAttemptIdBuilder = new StringBuilder("attempt_");
{noformat}

instead of:

{noformat}
StringBuilder taskAttemptIdBuilder = new StringBuilder("task");
{noformat}
