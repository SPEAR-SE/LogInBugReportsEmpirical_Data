[The reason why we didn't see this before is related to how we generate the GenericUDFIn. DPP is created for UDF like {noformat}GenericUDFIn(Column[ds], RS[12]){noformat} and is not created if the joining column is resolved to constant like {noformat}GenericUDFIn(Const string 2008-04-08, RS[11]){noformat} Previously we had one UDF resolved like above, so we only created one DPP.
Anyway our code needs to be robust to handle both cases. I'll upload a patch to add cycle detection., Patch to add the detection. Basically it's just copied from Tez. And manually verified it solves the issue found in HIVE-15357. [~csun] and [~xuefuz], please have a look. Thanks.

I also need some help from Chao for this question. When there're two cyclic DPP operators, we have to remove one of them. When Tez does it, it removes the one with smaller data size:
{code}
    for (Operator<?> o : component) {
      if (o instanceof AppMasterEventOperator) {
        if (victim == null
            || o.getConf().getStatistics().getDataSize() < victim.getConf().getStatistics()
                .getDataSize()) {
          victim = (AppMasterEventOperator) o;
        }
      }
    }
{code}
But I think this is wrong and we should remove the one with bigger data size - because bigger data size means fewer keys are pruned. And we even have SparkRemoveDynamicPruningBySize to remove DPP if the expected data size exceeds some threshold.
[~csun], any ideas on this? I'm assuming the output of DPP is the keys that have survived, not filtered.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12843384 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Test failures are not related., [~lirui] I agree - removing the smaller one doesn't make sense to me either. I'll take a look at the patch., +1, Committed to master. Thanks Chao for the review!]
