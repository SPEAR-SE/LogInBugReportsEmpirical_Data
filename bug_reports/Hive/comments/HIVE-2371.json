Review request for hive and Siying Dong.


Summary
-------

Adding order by to the two queries used to create the test tables makes the test deterministic.


This addresses bug HIVE-2371.
    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-2371


Diffs

Testing
-------

I ran the test and verified it passed.

I also had a person who had been seeing the test fail do to non-determinism run the test and verify that it passed.


Thanks,

Kevin
