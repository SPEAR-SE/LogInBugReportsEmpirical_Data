[[~eugene.koifman], it's past time to fix this but first I have a couple of questions:

#  Why does the equivalent SELECT statement say "col1" while the description says "an integer in the second column"?  Does this assume column numbers start with zero?
#*  "select col1, count\(*\) from $table group by col1;"
I tried to figure it out from the MR program, but strained my brain.
#  Is there a typo in the output for your sample dataset (1,1,1,3,3,3,5)?  I see three 3s, not 2.  
#*  1, 3
3, 2,
5, 1
... and presumably the comma after the 2 (or 3) can be removed.

The doc has a new location, by the way:

1. The MR program does "value.get(1)" in reduce() which means it's "col1" is the 2nd column.  Presumably the 1st (0th) column could have been "UserName".
2. you are correct on both, Done:

The following very simple MapReduce program reads data from one table which it assumes to have an integer in the second column ("column 1"), and counts how many instances of each distinct value it finds. That is, it does the equivalent of "select col1, count\(*\) from $table group by col1;".

For example, if the values in the second column are \{1,1,1,3,3,5\} the program will produce this output of values and counts:

1, 3
3, 2
5, 1
