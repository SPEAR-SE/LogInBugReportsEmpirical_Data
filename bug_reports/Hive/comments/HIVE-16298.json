ATTACHMENT ID: 12860502 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, I just followed the convention that was followed on the params around it .. I can remove it, committed to master, [~jdere], since this was committed to master after branch-2 split off on March 23 (11:06pm PDT) the fix version should say 3.0.0.  If you want it in 2.3.0 commit it to branch-2.  For 2.2.0 commit to branch-2.2.

Nudge (edit 20/Sep/17):  This is in master for release 3.0.0 but not in branch-2.3 for 2.3.0, nor branch-2 for 2.4.0.  So the fix version should be changed from 2.3.0 to 3.0.0., Doc note:  This adds *hive.stats.correlated.multi.key.joins* to HiveConf.java, so it needs to be documented in the wiki.

* [Configuration Properties -- Statistics | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Statistics]

Added a TODOC3.0 label (which might be changed to 2.2 or 2.3 later).

Update (20/Sep/17):  HIVE-17308 changes the default for *hive.stats.correlated.multi.key.joins* to true in the same release (3.0.0)., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
