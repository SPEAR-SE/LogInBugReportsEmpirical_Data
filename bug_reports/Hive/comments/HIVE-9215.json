[Attaching testcase that repro's the issue.  Expected one row of output, got none., FYI [~jcamachorodriguez], [~ashutoshc] you guys might be interested., As commented in code, select operator in RS-SEL-RS should not be removed because current compilers are not expecting null reducer operator. We might modify compilers but seemed to much. Or We can remove identity select in physical optimizer.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12689288 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1, +1 from me too.  I also thought that, but am a bit new to the compiler code.  Thanks Navis for looking and confirming my suspicion., Committed to trunk. Thanks Xuefu and Szehon, for the review!, Merged to Spark branch as well. Thanks, Navis.]
