[You'll also need to install the jdo2 jar in your maven repository:

{code}
download jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar to your working directory
mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=javax.jdo -DartifactId=jdo2-api -Dversion=2.3-ec -Dpackaging=jar -Dfile=jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar
{code}

The new jdo jar is available from http://www.datanucleus.org/downloads/maven2/javax/jdo/jdo2-api/2.3-ec/jdo2-api-2.3-ec.jar
, Can we wrap it into a pom file and deploy to, perhaps, apache maven? , Seems this issue has been addressed by HIVE-4089?, After mavenization, this is no longer a problem.]
