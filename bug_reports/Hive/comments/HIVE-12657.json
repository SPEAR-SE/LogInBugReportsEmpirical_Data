[[~pxiong] and [~ashutoshc] fyi.., [~prasanth_j], select distinct star is just doing group by *, if it has problem, then union distinct should also have problem as it is based on select distinct *. So only selectDistinctStar.q has problem, not any others? Thanks., I haven't tried running union distinct on jdk 1.8. I encountered this specifically when should up as a test failure. It could happen for other cases as well. From a high level, I see order of the columns have changed in group by but not sure. Hashmap ordering between jdk 1.7 and 1.8 is known to be different but I don't know why would that affect column order in group by. , It appears the the column order is changed. Is column order defined for select *? If not, that is not a problem; I suspect it is, and anyway it would be nice if it was consistent.
-My telepathic debugging powers tell me that the code is using a hashset somewhere to achieve the "distinct" part, and the order change is expected because that is not ordered and ordering is known to be different in different jdks-. 
-We need to replace that with linkedhashset-, [~sershe], i believe in your "telepathic debugging powers" and i felt the same. I did not investigate deeper but I think select distinct implementation is simple and I did not use HashMap or Set somewhere. I may look into it deeper... , Ah nm, I was thinking about something else., Simple patch. The relevant change is one-line, changing RR to LinkedHashMap for tables; the rest is comments, some cleanup, and out file updates.

[~prasanth_j] [~pxiong] can you take a look?, [~sershe], thanks for your prompt action. Patch looks good to me +1 pending QA run. Just one question. Shall we also make invRslvMap a LinkedHashMap too?, That map is never iterated, as far as I see. I made it private, only accessible thru a point lookup method, and left a comment in case someone decides to make it public.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12782609 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The same patch... need to see if tests are timing out all the time (seems unlikely, since the patch just changes hashmap to linkedhashmap), ideally before the logs are deleted if they time out again.,
