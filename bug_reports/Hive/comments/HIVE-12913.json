[[~szehon] Could you help me review this patch? The patch excludes {{hive-unit-hadoop-2}} and {{hive-minikdc}} tests from running on MR1 tests., Hey Sergio, i see what you want to do, but I think it would be much better if we didn't hard code the values, and just read it from configuration.. otherwise we have to change this file and rebuild this everytime there is something like this happening (tests that run with specific profile)., Thanks [~szehon]. You're right. I need to move the hard-coded values to the configuration file.

I attached another patch that does that. The new property name is {{unitTests.excludeDirectories}}. If it is set, then will take the directories excluded from it., +1]
