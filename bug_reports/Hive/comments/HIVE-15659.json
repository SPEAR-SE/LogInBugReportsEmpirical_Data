[[~csun], do you know whether the SOFE exception happens at the driver or executor? Secondly, I'm not sure if Spark will load additional jars for each input file. To me, it seems to be "per task"., This happens at executor and is per task. However, I reproduced this in CDH Hive 1.1.0 and I think the latest master already fixed it via HIVE-11878, indirectly. I'm going to close this as "invalid".
