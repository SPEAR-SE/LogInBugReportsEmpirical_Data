[[~jcamachorodriguez] Any idea why?, [~prasanth_j], I'll take a look, [~prasanth_j], problem was caused by the removal of an identity project. I attach a patch solving the problem, could you check it? Thanks, Thanks [~jcamachorodriguez] for the patch! LGTM, +1. Pending tests.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12695557 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~prasanth_j], changes in the stats in golden files are related to Union operators. Some changes are from PARTIAL to COMPLETE, but some other changes increase the estimated size... What do you think?

I'll check further later on. Thanks, [~jcamachorodriguez] The union issue was already known. I have a TODO in StatsRulesProcFactory which says union queries have issue with propagating the aliases. It seems to work now. Thats a good thing. But I am concerned about the UDF, UDAF which seems to cause regression., Thanks! I'll take a look and submit a new patch, More conservative patch, applying new method only to Limit operator.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12695933 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~prasanth_j], test fail is not related to the patch., [~jcamachorodriguez] This looks good for this case. I saw another case in HIVE-9392 where data size became 0 because of similar issue. I will debug it again and see if the issue happens again. If so I will generalize this patch for other operators as well. For now I will commit this patch. Thanks!, Committed patch to trunk., Thanks! I agree with you, it could be generalized; this is a fix for that specific case.

Just for giving a bit more info on what was going on with UDFs with the former patch in case it helps.
E.g. consider udf_inline.q. You get a plan TS[0]-UDFT[1]-Limit[2]-FS[3].
The stats were lost after UDFT was applied because they are stored for input column col_0, and they propagate to the Limit operator still referring to col_0.
However, the UDF generates tuples with schema (col_1, col_2).
As the logic for calculating the stats for the limit operator was looking for stats for columns col_1, col_2, and there is a mismatch schema-stats, it was removing the stats., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
