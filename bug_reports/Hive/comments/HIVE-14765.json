[Hi [~sershe]
I think I found a possible reason for this. Would you mind if I take a look at it?

Edit: Unfortunately my theory doesn't hold water.... I thought it might be because we aren't clearing the ConcurrentHashMap in the CodahaleMetrics used to store the Guages in (besides the metrics registry). But it turns out the map is completely superfluous, we aren't using it at all. Can you give me any details as to when you could see these warnings in the logs? Was the HMS running as a service or in embedded mode? I think we could run into it with an embedded HMS if the HMSClient is recreated.

Thanks,
Zs.]
