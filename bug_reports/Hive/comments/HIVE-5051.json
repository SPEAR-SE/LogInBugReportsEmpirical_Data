[Interesting, yup, looks like this is needed for all three of those wrappers, including AccessControlException. I'd even say it might make sense to remove the hiveException and authorizationException wrappers. The third is different from the perspective of instantiation code, but I cannot remember why it was made to be different. If you can run tests with all 3 wrappers removed, and it works, I'd go with that route.,

This message is automatically generated., [~sushanth] I'm not sure I follow your comment.  Only 2 wrapper 'rest' the root cause and thus cause the problem.
You can't remove the wrapper altogether since unless you change method signatures on HiveAuthorizationProvider to add other elements to 'throws' clause., 'rest' above should read 'reset', Ah, my mistake. I thought accessControlException also suffered from the same problem.

(And by removing the wrappers, I meant that it if we're removing the initCause, we might as well inline code usages, but that's a minor thing and irrelevant now)

This gets a +1 from me., (Also, I realize I was unclear when I initially said wrapper - I meant wrapper function, not wrapper exception. The latter is definitely needed.), +1, Committed to trunk.
