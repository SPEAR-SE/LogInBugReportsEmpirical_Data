[I think the problem is actually the part where MetaExceptions are turned into NoSuchObject...
Every other step is just wrapping exceptions to match method signature, or for network transfer between metastore and metastore client.
However, translating Meta... to NoSuchObject... is unwarranted., I do not think it is warranted either.  So I believe my options are to either
 # allow the JDOException to escape or
 # add MetaException to the list of thrown exceptions of org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.RawStore#getDatabase and alter org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.ObjectStore#getDatabase to not wrap the MetaException

I suppose no existing code could break for option 2 as its _adding_ an exception.  Looking at the interface of RawStore, almost every other method does specify MetaException, making the lack of it on getDatabase seem like an oversight.  Does anyone know any history of why its missing on getDatabase?  Should it have been there the whole time?

If there's no reason not to include it, I'll submit a patch with this change.]
