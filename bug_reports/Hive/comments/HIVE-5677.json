[Just curious, with the changes in the patch, are we still able to debug beeline process remotely?, This patch works for me, +1. 

[~xuefuz], I'm afraid I don't know about the remote debugging aspect, how do you normally do that?, [~sushanth] I was talking about debug options that usually set on HADOOP_OPTS. In hive script, HIVE_OPTS takes what HADOOP_OPTS sets, so debug can be enabled.

Nevertheless, this patch is no longer necessary after HIVE-6652. Please try and let me know if the problem remains. , Fixed via HIVE-6652. Feel free to reopen if issue persists., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
