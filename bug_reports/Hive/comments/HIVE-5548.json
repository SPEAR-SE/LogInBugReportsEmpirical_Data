This message is automatically generated., Hey, those tests you commented out in testConfProperties were failing is that correct? Can tell me a little more about what is going on., Yeah, I only commented the one that may fail or pass depending on the env. (See the notes that I made in that part of the code.) For instance, it passed in my local testing, but failed in precommit test, depending on whether fs.default.name is overwritten in system properties.

On the other hand, this test, including all other tests under common weren't even turned on, so commenting out this one does no damage of any sort., +1, Thanks for the information., Thank you for the patch Xuefu! I have committed it to trunk!, Thanks, Brock!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hive-trunk-hadoop2 #510 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-hadoop2/510/])
