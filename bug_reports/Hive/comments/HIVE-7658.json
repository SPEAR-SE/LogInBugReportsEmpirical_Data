[Hive uses ClassLoader.getResource("hive-site.xml") for finding the path to hive-site.xml file. ClassLoader is retrieved using Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader() which returns a chain of class loaders. One of the ClassLoaders in the chain is sun.misc.Launcher$AppClassLoader. This particular ClassLoader treats the empty entry in ClassPath (example: /path/to/jar1.jar::/path/to/jar2) as current working directory of the process (see [here|https://community.oracle.com/thread/2456122?start=0&tstart=0]). If you look at the classpath of the Hive process, there is one such empty entry after the hadoop jars and before hive conf dir and hive jars. As the empty entry is before hive conf directory, ClassLoader picks up the first occurrence of hive-site.xml in current working directory.

Looking at the Hive scripts, adding empty path is an issue in hive scripts it self. Following line in {{bin/hive}} script causes an extra ":" before the hive constructed classpath when HADOOP_CLASSPATH is empty. "hadoop" scripts adds another ":" to its classpath and appends given hive classpath.

{code}
export HADOOP_CLASSPATH="${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}:${CLASSPATH}"
{code}
, Attached patch resolves the issue by checking whether HADOOP_CLASSPATH is non-empty before using it.,
