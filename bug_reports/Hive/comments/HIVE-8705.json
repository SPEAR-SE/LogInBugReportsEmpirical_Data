[cc [~thejas] , An example of usage of the attached test:
{code}
java -cp .:/usr/hive/lib/* TestPreAuthenticatedKerberosSubject -u "jdbc:hive2://my-hostname:10001/default;principal=hive/my-hostname@EXAMPLE.COM;transportMode=http;httpPath=cliservice;kerberosAuthType=fromSubject" -p "vaibhav@EXAMPLE.COM" -k "/root/vaibhav.headless.keytab"
{code}, +1, [~hagleitn] Possible to have it in 0.14? W/o this clients who programmatically login to kerberos will face issues. Thanks!, Reattaching for precommit run. No clue why this isn't getting picked up.,
