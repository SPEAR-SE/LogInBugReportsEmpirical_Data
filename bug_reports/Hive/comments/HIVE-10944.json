[Fixes the issues., Started HS2 with and without metrics, verify that these issues are not seen in both cases.  This code path isn't exercised in any unit tests, so its manual testing.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12737896 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, synchronized (as far as I can see) call to isInitialized from incrementMetricsCounter might affect perf for parallel workloads, like we saw before with locks in logging, kryo, and HDFS code. Also config checks in other places may not be cheap. Is it possible to cache those values, I assume once initialized it won't change back to false?, Yea good points, i was just trying to get this to work first.

Removed the unnecessary conf checks and got rid of the synchronized block by doing some refactoring.  

Also added a review board:  [https://reviews.apache.org/r/35181/|https://reviews.apache.org/r/35181/],

ATTACHMENT ID: 12738307 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, +1 from my side, one nit can be fixed on commit; the others' feedback needs to be addressed :), Sure, will fix that nit.  [~lskuff] can you take a look to see if it addresses your comments?  Thanks., Will fix the small nits as suggested on commit, verified locally.  Putting patch up for the record., Committed to master, thanks Lenni and Sergey for reviews., Cherry-picked to branch-1, No doc needed:  Although this changes the default value of the configuration parameter *hive.service.metrics.file.location* from {{file:///tmp/my-logging.properties}} to {{file:///tmp/report.json}}, HIVE-10927 changes it again to {{/tmp/report.json}}.]
