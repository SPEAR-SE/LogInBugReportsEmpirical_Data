Do you have additional logs from the container where this error was seen ? Also any steps to reproduce and how often are you able to reproduce this ?
Is this using the Tez 0.7.0 release or a snapshot ?
, this was the tez snapshot, works fine on the released version. we can close this, , As noted, this works with the released version.]
