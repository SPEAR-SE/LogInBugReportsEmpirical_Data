ATTACHMENT ID: 12695072 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures dont look related (these spark tests also failed in other builds). 

parquet_external_time will fail until the attached parquet file is checked in (/data/files/parquet_external_time.parq)., +1, Committed to trunk.  Thanks Brock for review., Adds property "hive.parquet.timestamp.skip.conversion", which needs to be documented., Done, added new section for [Parquet|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-Parquet] and mention this property., Got your back, [~szehon] -- I changed the version number from 0.14.0 to 1.2.0 (probably a copy-&-paste error).

* [hive.parquet.timestamp.skip.conversion | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.parquet.timestamp.skip.conversion], This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira., Hi [~szehon], is there a follow on task for the write path?, Why this hive.parquet.timestamp.skip.conversion option is enabled by default? 
Since according [parquet spec|https://github.com/Parquet/parquet-format/blob/master/LogicalTypes.md#timestamp_millis], parquet files don't keep local timezone. And we cann't distinguish from file what was the value of that option while parquet file was generating.]
