[I have the same problem,
I am on HDP 2.4
I created a big external hive table with a location
I've set some hive views on that table
And I launch a hive to insert the contents of these views inside a hbase storage backed table.
I get the exact same error you're getting.
, We are observing a similar behavior in HDP 2.4.0 when using TEZ execution engine.
Inserts into HBased-backed tables that do not require multiple mappers succeed.
Ones that require multiple mappers fail with exactly the same errors.

If hive execution engine is set to MR, statements succeed and data are inserted as expected.
, [~damien.carol] Per the docs here: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HBaseIntegration, the {{hbase.mapred.output.outputtable}} table property will need to be set for an insert query. Can you check the output of show create table and describe formatted to see if that property is set?, Yes this fix the pb., Yes this fix the pb., Hive-Hbase integration documentation (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HBaseIntegration) states that hbase.mapred.output.outputtable property is optional, and needed only when one wants to insert into a table. The latter statement is obviously incorrect, as prior to Feb 26, 2016, this property wasn't even documented and inserts into HBase-backed tables were working just fine with MR engine.

If TEZ does require hbase.mapred.output.outputtable property to be explicitly set, documentation needs to be updated to indicate that fact.

One more thing, all the existing samples have hbase.mapred.output.outputtable and hbase.table.name set to the same value. If there is no use case when they are different, why the former even needed?, I have tried by setting up {code} hbase.mapred.output.outputtable {code} but it's throwing the same error but when I only try to insert one record into the table then it works properly and no error. 
Even after the load job fails some of the data gets to the table anyways.]
