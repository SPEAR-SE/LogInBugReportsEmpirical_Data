ATTACHMENT ID: 12680291 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, This seems incorrect, transactions are rolled back with all nested transactions. What is the reason for this change?, Canceling patch till Sergey's question is answered., After consulting with [~sushanth] this looks unnecessary. I am deleting this jira

Thanks
