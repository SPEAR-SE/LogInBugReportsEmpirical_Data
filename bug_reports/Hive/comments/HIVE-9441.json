ATTACHMENT ID: 12693795 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thank you Julian for the patch and Ashutosh for the review! I have committed this to trunk., Great. Now that patch is in, it should be trivial for Hive to upgrade from calcite-1.0-SNAPSHOT to calcite-1.0.0 when it is released. I started the PPMC vote today, so with luck 1.0 will be ready on 1/30.]
