[It seems like HIVE-4220., I agree - HIVE-4220 may be a manifestation, although I think this ThreadLocal based patch or one using commons.lang FastDateFormat (which is thread-safe) would be preferable over the patch submitted in HIVE-4220., +1, running test, passed all tests. But HIVE-4220 has some minor optimization which removes unnecessary date.toString() call. It would be good to be merged with that., navis requested code review of "HIVE-4516 [jira] Fix concurrency bug in serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/io/TimestampWritable.java".

HIVE-4516 Fix concurrency bug in serde/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/serde2/io/TimestampWritable.java

A patch for concurrent use of TimestampWritable which occurs in a multithreaded scenario (as found in AmpLab Shark).  A static SimpleDateFormat (not ThreadSafe) is used by TimestampWritable in CTAS DDL statements where it manifests as data corruption when used in a concurrent environment.
