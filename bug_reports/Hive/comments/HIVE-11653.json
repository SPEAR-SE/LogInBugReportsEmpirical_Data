[I think I'd like to take a stab at this if it's alright with you? I've been annoyed by this ever since beeline was introduced :)

We need to make a decision on what we want to do though.

We could just ignore it if a user doesn't provide username and password. If Hive is configured to accept it it'll fail with an authentication error anyway. On the other hand it provides a way to not pass in the password in a way that ends up in the history or on screen.

Any ideas on how to best handle this?, For now workaround is : pass -p "" argument. You will not need to enter the username and password.
