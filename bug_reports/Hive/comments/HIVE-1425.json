[Also (unrelated) fix the description for hive.exec.pre.hooks ("Pre Execute Hook for Tests") since we are using them for more than just tests now, and add hive.exec.post.hooks (currently missing from hive-default.xml).

, Carl has opened HIVE-1479 for the hooks.
, @John: Sorry, I forgot that this ticket already covered the hook issue. I went ahead and resolved HIVE-1479 as a duplicate of this issue., +1.
, Committed. Thanks John!
