[with test-cases, +1. Did the fill() on the main path get committed, and does it need to be removed with this patch?, The fill after every operation is unnecessary, the theory about the other patch was that some UDF in that query wasn't handling the hasNoNulls flag.

That is not true, the original issue was that a scratch column feeding the COALESCE() is reused for the Join output columns & setting a column value via FloatReader does not set the isNull[batchIndex] = false (and then the Filter on cr_return_amount removes those rows).

CBO rewrites the left outer join into an inner join, pushing the filter below the join & there's no more TS-FIL-MJ-FIL as the FIL migrates to the broadcast side.

Here's my simplified example, which I used to narrow down the issue to FloatTreeReader.

set hive.cbo.enable=false;
set hive.vectorized.execution.reducesink.new.enabled=false;
set hive.vectorized.execution.mapjoin.native.enabled=true;

set hive.vectorized.execution.reduce.groupby.enabled=false;

Commit:  9cab4414caf1bba2eb1852536a9d3676ba7eab21., Thanks lefty, looks like I left out the JIRA id for all commits today.

Pushed errata.txt , Should this be in 2.0? looks like a bad bug, Yeah, it should be - I will cherry-pick this and amend the commit text when doing so., Great, thanks Gopal., Also committed to branch-1, [~mmccline], the branch-1 commit doesn't include the JIRA number.  (Déjà vu:  see comment about previous commit.)

Please add this to the errata.txt file that was created by HIVE-11704.

Commit:  3734d5b674b4e8de9c0cc751650aee3194bfb93a., Added to errata.txt for branch-1.]
