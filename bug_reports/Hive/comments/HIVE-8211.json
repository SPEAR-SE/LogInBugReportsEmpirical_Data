[if timestamp value is converted to number then
int part is seconds
fractional part is milliseconds, microseconds, or nanoseconds (but up to 7 digits (not 9))
e.g.
{code}
select cast(cast('2015-05-14 23:20:34.123456789' as timestamp) as decimal(32,12));
OK
1431670834.1234567

select cast(cast('2015-05-14 23:20:34.123456789' as timestamp) as double());
OK
1.4316708341234567E9
{code}, correction
{code}
select cast(cast('2015-05-14 23:20:34.123456789' as timestamp) as double);
OK
1.4316708341234567E9
{code}, Somewhere along the line TIMESTAMP aggregation was fixed.]
