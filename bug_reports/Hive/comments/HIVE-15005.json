[[~hzlu] Thanks for noticing this. However, the rationale behind choosing this kind of path naming is that {{hive.cluster.delegation.token.store.zookeeper.znode}} is used both by metastore server and hs2 running embedded metastore (in which case the final path is /hive/cluster/delegation/delegationHIVESERVER2/tokens).

cc [~thejas] , Did you mean it is not a bug, we just use /delegationMETASTORE/ or /delegationHIVESERVER2/?
It seems if I set hive.cluster.delegation.token.store.zookeeper.znode=/hive/cluster/delegation/,
the final path would be /hive/cluster/delegation/METASTORE.
So I just think it would be better to add a slash., bq. used both by metastore server and hs2 running embedded metastore
Just to clarify, HS2 has separate set of delegation tokens and the separate HS2 directory is used to store them.

This value is a prefix for that as documented. If the prefix is /hive/cluster/delegation/, then dir should be /hive/cluster/delegation/METASTORE. If it is /hive/cluster/delegation, then it should be /hive/cluster/delegationMETASTORE.
