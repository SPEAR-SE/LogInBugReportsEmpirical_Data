ATTACHMENT ID: 12811260 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, [~sershe], [~gopalv] - could you review this please., From talking with [~gopalv] - hadoop classpath was making native libs available. Will make some changes to the patch for the same., Ok. Looked into this some more. `hadoop classpath` does not provide the LD_LIBRARY_PATH. This is setup separately via template.py, and required hadoop_home to be set. (Ends up being "None/lib/native").
Somehow on the cluster I was using to test this - the LD_LIBRARY_PATH was setup correctly before invoking runLlapDaemon.sh. A yarn NM export maybe ?

IAC - the native part seems unrelated to this jira, and can be investigated in a follow up.
[~gopalv] - please review., LGTM - +1., Thanks for the review. Committing.]
