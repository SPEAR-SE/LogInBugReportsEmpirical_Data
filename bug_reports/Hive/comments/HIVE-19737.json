[How is this different than HIVE-19323?, Sorry I missed HIVE-19323. I already did part of the work in HIVE-19440. HIVE-19323 need to be rebased since HIVE-19440 is already committed. This ticket is to fix a bug introduced in the committed code. cc [~alangates]., Rather than create yet another Jira that will have to work it's way through the patch queue I'll just fix these in HIVE-19323, which I now have to rebase anyway., Thanks [~alangates]!, See HIVE-19323 patch 6.  For future reference, there are tests for all of the different db types now, see standalone-metastore/DEV-README on how to run them, as the oracle, postgres, and sqlsvr scripts all had issues.]
