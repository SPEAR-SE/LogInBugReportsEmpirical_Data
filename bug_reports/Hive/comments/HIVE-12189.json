ATTACHMENT ID: 12767094 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, The 4 failures are not related. Their ages are more than 14. , I did some comparing tests:
1. Backported HIVE-11652 to HIVE 1.1 version, does not make compile much faster, it still took 102 seconds. So HIVE-11652 alone can not make egw.startWalking as fast as HIVE 2.0. I need find more jiras to backport.
2. Only apply the patch for this jira(HIVE-12189), the compile time for the query drop to 6.2 seconds for HIVE 1.1. 
3. For HIVE 2.0, this patch help drop the compile time from 6.6 second to 2.3
, [~csun], [~ctang.ma] could you review the change? Thanks, Sorry, didn't see this. I'll take a look at the patch today., [~jcamachorodriguez] This one might interest you., Patch looks good to me. +1. I don't think we should add predicates that are semantically the same.
, Committed to branch-1 and master. Thanks Yongzhi.]
