[FYI [~Ferd] or [~dongc] :  any interest in looking at this?, Hi [~szehon], I will take a look at it., For the updateLocation command, it will check the table property url as well if you specify the property key name. Can you provide the command you are using which failed to update the url? Thank you!
https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/b8250ac2f30539f6b23ce80a20a9e338d3d31458/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/tools/HiveMetaTool.java#L339, Hm, I think its supposed to update the MTable as well?  Right now its updating only MStorageDescriptor.

I am doing something like:  metatool -updateLocation hdfs://namenode2:8020 hdfs://namenode:8020 -tablePropKey avro.schema.url -serdePropKey avro.schema.url , with expectation that afterwards the table avro schema url has namenode2.
, Basically, after you run the query, run describe extended on the table.  The table should still have the old avro.schema.url (hdfs://namenode:8080)., I am using derby as the default database. It's easy to reproduce this issue since metatool and hs2 are using the different derby db. You can find this by executing "find / -name metastore" and there are serveral metastore db created. I will try the mysql to see whether it's the same problem. For UT, it can be updated successfully. (Attached is the unit test I used), Ah yea it has to be the same db instance (like mysql).  It is easy to repro manually, but might be hard to write a unit test for it.  Thanks, The table schema information is not the property of Storage Descriptor. It's a table parameter instead., Yes, the same result for mysql. I verified my patch manually. Please help me review it. Thank you!,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12725504 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Thanks Ferdinand for taking care of this.  Can we keep the update of any property that match StorageDescriptor property, and just add another method for Table property?  I am afraid that somebody might be using this, unless we can confirm that that StorageDescriptor property is never used., Thanks [~szehon] for your review. Update patch addressing backwards compatibility, Thanks! +1,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12725773 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build,  Thanks [~szehon] for your review. And the failed cases are irrelevant., Committed to trunk.  Thanks a lot Ferdinand!, Does this need documentation?

Hmm ... the Hive metatool isn't documented yet because I dropped the ball when [~ashutoshc] and [~shreepadma] asked me to create a wiki page for it.  If somebody will give me a copy of the --help output then I'll take care of it right away.  Or you can wait until I get Hive installed, a long-delayed task on my TO DO list.  I tried to find the information in the code but only had partial success.

(Also, the Fix Version should be specified above.), Hi [~leftylev], here comes the output for help option. And I have updated the fixed version. If you need any other information about metatool, feel free to let me know. Thank you!

{noformat}, Super, thanks [~Ferd]!, [~Ferd], a first draft of the metatool doc is ready for review in the wiki:

* [Hive MetaTool | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Hive+MetaTool], Awesome!! You can add the following information to the use example section. Thanks [~leftylev]
