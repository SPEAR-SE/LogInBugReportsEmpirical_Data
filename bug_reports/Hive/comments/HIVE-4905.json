[*For left/right outer joins:*
{code:sql}
select * from tbl1 left outer join tbl2
on tbl1.col1 = tbl2.col2 and tbl2.month=20 and tbl2.day=20
where tbl1.month=20 and tbl1.day=20
{code}
The key is to put the partitions of tbl2 in the ‘on’ condition and the partitions of tbl1 in the ‘where’ condition.

*For full outer joins:*
The only way is to wrap both the tables in a subquery.
{code:sql}
select * from
(select * from tbl1 where month=20 and day=20) tbl1_x
full outer join
(select * from tbl2 where month=20 and day=20) tbl2_x
on tbl1_x.col1 = tbl2_x.col2
{code}, Any update on this Jira?]
