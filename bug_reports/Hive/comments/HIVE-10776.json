create table studenttab10k (age2 int);
insert into studenttab10k values(1);

create table student_acid (age int, grade int)
 clustered by (age) into 1 buckets;

insert into student_acid(age) select * from studenttab10k;
{noformat}, should've added in previous comment that it's not related to ACID.  (and insert into studenttab10k values(1); is not necessary), [~alangates], could you review please, [~sushanth], this is a good candidate for 1.2.1.  Support for adding 'age' like {{insert into student_acid(age) select * from studenttab10k;}} was added in 1.2.  It NPEs if target table is bucketed.,
