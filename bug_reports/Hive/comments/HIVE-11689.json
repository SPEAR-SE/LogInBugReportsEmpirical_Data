+1(NB), LGTM, +1, Actually the test failures look real. I will investigate and update the patch., Seems to be caused exclusively by CompletionPort thing. Hmm..., Fix CS to not be global; it's not thread-safe in a sense that multiple threads will get random futures from queue if they use it together, I didn't realize multiple input initializers will collide 0_o, xml change will go in as a separate patch,
