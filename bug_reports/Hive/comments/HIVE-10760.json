[Looks reasonable, Lekha. +1.

Setting as patch-available to have precommit tests run on it., Err.. actually, looks like I don't have privileges to set it to patch-available from in-progress. Could you please hit the "submit patch" button here to allow the precommit tests to pick up this patch?, Changes error thrown on HCatalog Get Column for Non-existent columns from 'Server Error(500)' to 'Not Found error(404)', Done. Can you please let me know if I need to do anything else here. Thanks!, Sorry, it still seems to be marked as in-progress. From the mail notification I got, looks like it transitioned from in-progress to patch-available, and then transitioned back to in-progress. I'm going to try assigning it to me, marking it as available, and then assigning it back to you., Okay, that worked - the precommit tests should pick it up now.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734224 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Hi [~sushanth], I dont think my change should've caused the test to fail as its just a string modification. Can you let me know what I need to do here. Thanks!, Hi, the failed test is definitely unrelated.

I will go ahead and commit this., Committed to master and branch-1.2. Thanks, Lekha!, Great, thank you!]
