[So the query was malformed. There's missing comma between day_timestamp and count(*) as guid_count.

Anyway the parser should report a syntax error, not fail on a NPE., Actually, there are two mistakes in the query. One is mentioned above, the other one is an extra ',' at the end of line "floor((`timestamp` ...".
Was not able to reproduce the NPE with any combinations of the mentioned mistakes on the latest Hive 2.2.0. In any combinations ParseExceptions were thrown.
See the attached query file created to reproduce the issue. 
(After correcting the mentioned mistakes the query runs smoothly.), Closed as I was not able to reproduce. Feel free to reopen if reproduced or additional information is available.]
