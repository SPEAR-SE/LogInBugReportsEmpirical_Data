[Tests have successfully run: http://bigtop01.cloudera.org:8080/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/994/testReport/ (the 7 failures are unrelated). Unfortunately jira was down when the tests completed (so no auto update), This is really good in terms of memory efficiency. LGTM +1., Committed to trunk. Thanks for the review Vikram!]
