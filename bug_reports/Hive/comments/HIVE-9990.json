[I am not able to reproduce it locally. I looked at the recent jenkins job and didn't find the log for this failed case. From HIVE-9934, I am wondering whether it is caused by spark side that two threads are trying to fetch the same file. I am not quite sure the root cause and will keep this jira open once we can reproduce it.
Hi [~xuefuz], can you reproduce it in the latest trunk?
, [~Ferd], thanks for looking into this. My desktop always has the problem running spark tests, due to snappy native library. I guess my problem could be different from Jenkins. If you cannot produce, I think that could be just a transient failure. You may close the problem as "not reproducible". Thanks., Thank you for your comments, [~xuefuz]. is the hive-exec jar already generated under jars path? From the log attached by [~csun] in HIVE-9934, it sounds hive-exec was not able to be generated. Can you attach your failed hive log to this jira?]
