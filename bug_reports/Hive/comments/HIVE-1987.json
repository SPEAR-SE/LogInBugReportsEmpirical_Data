[Looks like this was broken by HIVE-1408 which was committed back in July.

@Ed: Is there any way to test JSP pages?, We have two tickets open. One to precompile the pages, one to move to wikit which would move 99% of the code to servlets. I am a big fan of moving all this to wikit for 0.8.0. This page is not critical to the operation of the Web Interface. We can just remove the page (since you can figure the info out from the JobTracker page) or change the signature back to public if possible. Let me know what you want to do., @Ed: I like option 1 (removing the page). Changing the signature back to public doesn't seem ok to me., Any resolution here?, Committed to trunk. Thanks Ed!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #904 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/904/])
