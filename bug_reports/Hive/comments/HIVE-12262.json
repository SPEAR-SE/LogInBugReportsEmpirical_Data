ATTACHMENT ID: 12768591 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Patch committed to master and branch-1. Thanks Thejas for review!, Sorry for chiming in late, but wouldn't the patch actually hide the underlying root problem?, [~xuefuz] I haven't been able to reproduce this problem, except by explicitly deleting the root directory of operation logs. However, it is not clear if directory deletion was the root cause of the problem seen in production environments. In case of production environments, users tend to want resolution asap, and they restart HS2 for that, making it very hard to investigate the environment for possible reasons. The HiveServer2 logs didn't have more useful information than what is pasted in description. So the current state wasn't anyway helping in finding the root problem.

This change should hopefully keep the production systems up and running without needing a restart. 
If you have any suggestions for additional debugging that can help in detecting the cause of the failure, please suggest them. We can use a new jira for that.]
