[[~jcamachorodriguez], We would like to get this in 2.1.0 release. , [~amareshwari], thanks for letting me know. I plan to create the first RC beginning next week; there should be time to get it in., Simple enough patch. , Hmm. I wonder how (and if ;)) it ever worked. Could the list result be DB-specific, or is this the bug for all DBs?
IIRC some methods use a call on the query object that forces a single result, that may be a better option here., Yeah.. seems it was always falling to back to ORM - and never worked with directsql earlier with HIVE-11487. I dont think we have a way to test whether api is answered from directsql vs orm in unit tests.

btw, we deployed the above fix in our production environment, and it is working fine.

bq. IIRC some methods use a call on the query object that forces a single result, that may be a better option here.
Didnt find any. Can you give more pointers?, Just to reaffirm the gravity of this fix, in our production, we had a box with both mysql and hive metastore running. Without this fix, both processes are continuously using 500-600 percent cpu each. After deploying this, the total cpu usage for both processes is around 50. , query.setUnique(true);

See e.g. isViewTable, Updated the patch. , Removing 2.1.0 target as issue is not tagged as Critical/Blocker and the RC will be created tomorrow. Please feel free to commit to branch-2.1 anyway and fix for 2.1.0 if this happens before the release., +1. This should be in 2.1, +1 for the patch. Waiting for Hive QA builds to happen. But no response from Hive QA for last 3 days.

cc [~jcamachorodriguez] , Some issue in the pre-commit job. This issue wasn't added to pre-commit queue. This has happened to me before in another hive issue was working on. I've added manually now. ,
