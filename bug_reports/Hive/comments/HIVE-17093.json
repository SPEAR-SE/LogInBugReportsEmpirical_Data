[The patch localizes ssl-client.xml instead of ssl-server.xml which is used by NNs/DNs etc.
Also, it stops loading the configs, since they are loaded by relevant sections of DFSClient when required.

[~gopalv] - can you please take a look. I don't think this breaks anything for the LLAP UI wire encryption case (already broken?), bq.  I don't think this breaks anything for the LLAP UI wire encryption case 

If I'm not wrong the ssl-server is used for the secure shuffle handler.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12877209 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~gopalv] - don't think ssl shuffle works at the moment with llap. I can add the ssl-server changes back if you think that is required., Sure, I think we can add it back when SSL Shuffle gets worked out.

LGTM - +1, Thanks. Committing., Hive 3.0.0 has been released so closing this jira.]
