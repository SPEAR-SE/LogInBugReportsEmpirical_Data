[[~yzuehlke] Thanks for logging this. This is expected behavior. The support for predicate pushdown for simple delimited composite keys is not yet there in hive. One solution is to instead treat your keys as a complex composite key and provide a custom implementation for that. In that way, you should be able to take advantage of the hbase filters to make your queries run much faster. Please refer to the documentation here for further details[1]
