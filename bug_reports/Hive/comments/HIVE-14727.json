+1 from my side. What was the original failure?, There is no original failrue,I just read the llap-server code ,find this may case this suitation, This is not a problem during runtime (failure to allocate causes a process exit cleaning up all file handles), but I can see how the automated tools would find this as a possible leak scenario., Committed to master. Thanks for the patch!]
