ATTACHMENT ID: 12695412 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Ashish., Doc note:  This changes the default value of *hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout* in HiveConf.java, so the wiki needs to be updated.

* [ConfigurationProperties -- hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties#ConfigurationProperties-hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout]

_TLDR:_  Since it's a new parameter, version information won't be needed for the change of default.  However the wiki currently says this parameter was created in 1.2.0 although Spark merged to trunk in 0.15.0 aka 1.1.0 (HIVE-9448).  That's why this issue committed patches to 1.1.0 as well as 1.2.0, so the "1.2.0" version in the wiki needs to be changed to 1.1.0.

, Thanks for catching that Lefty!  I must have got confused with the versions , plus was tired when writing that, I'll change the version number for all the properties soon., Done, updated that property, and fixed all version info to Hive 1.1:
