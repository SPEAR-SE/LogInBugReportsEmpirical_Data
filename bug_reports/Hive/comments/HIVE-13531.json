[The concurrent access might be due to local fetch-task conversions.

{{set hive.fetch.task.conversion=none;}}, I investigated the problem now a bit more after the second heap dump and this problem can be reproduced if this UDF is used at the same time in multiple queries.

I'm not sure which is the best version to solve this problem, but there are at least 2 possible fixes.
1. Change the HashCache to a synchronized Map which is easily done with Collections.synchronizedMap
2. remove the static from the declaration of jsonObjectCache. I not sure why it is static, but if two different queries uses json_tuple they would use the same cache at the moment which would reduce the effective cache size for each query.

Another thing is the use of INIT_SIZE = 32 and CACHE_SIZE = 16 with a load factor of 0.6f. Wouldn't it make more sense to increase the load factor to nearly one and increase the CACHE_SIZE to 28 or something in that area?, is fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16060]
