[HIVE-1167.1.code.patch is the code change for review.
HIVE-1167.1.tests.patch is the change of the test results.
, This is required for HIVE-1117 to work. We want to make sure the QueryPlan object after serialization/deserialization loop are still the "same" as it was before, when comparing the "explain extended" results.
, Looks good. Will commit if tests pass. , Zheng, it failed on TestContribCliDriver and TestContribNegativeCliDriver (both are serde_regex.q). Can you take a look?, Sorry, I forgot to add the contrib test changes.

Ning, can you apply all these 3 patches together?
, Committed. Thanks Zheng!]
