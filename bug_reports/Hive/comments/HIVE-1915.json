[@Yongqiang: can you please create a review request on reviews.apache.org? Thanks!, @Carl, this is the link to review board request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/327/

Please review., All tables/parititons are dropped in QTestUtil at the end of a unit test.

Similarly, you should drop all databases/roles also in QTestUtil - I was getting
some intermittent errors, and traced the root cause to that, The new patch integrated Namit's comment. Added listRoleNames to the metastore API and cleanup all roles in QTestUtils., @Yongqiang: I posted comments here https://reviews.apache.org/r/331/
, @Carl, you comments are on existing code. Please open new jiras for them., @Yongqiang: Which comment are you referring to? As far as I can tell all of my reviewboard comments relate to changes that you made in your patch. To simplify matters can you please respond on reviewboard?

Thanks.
, Also, when you file a review request please remember to set the "Summary", "Bugs" and "Groups" fields.
This is necessary in order for reviewboard to send a notice to the dev mailing list.

, @Carl, if you want to use review board, go ahead using it. You should not assume everyone else wants to use it for every patch. I will only try to use it as much as possible.

, About the "existing code", it seems the patch added some existing codes to diff, i will try to remove them., a new patch for Carl's comments, +1. Will commit if tests pass., Committed. Thanks Yongqiang!]
