[The diff request is at: https://reviews.apache.org/r/2426/diff/#index_header, Robert,
Can you add a test case as well., Yes, but where can I read how a new test case should be added? , https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/howtocontribute.html#HowToContribute-AddaUnitTest
Has relevant info, New diff request at https://reviews.apache.org/r/2426/diff/2/

Changed fix to be more general and added tests.

There is still an issue that: 

create table <existing db>.<new table> (a string); 

doesn't work. But that's a topic for another Jira. 

, Actually I was wrong, create table <existing db>.<new table> (a string); seems to work ok, must have done something wrong when checking it before., current diff request at https://reviews.apache.org/r/2426/diff/#index_header, Looks like RB is no longer posting back on jira. I had the comment there about error message.

There are two concerns I have while doing such metastore related checks in SemanticAnalyzer. First it introduces TOCTTOU bug ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time-of-check-to-time-of-use ) since there is a small window when its possible that database get dropped after this call to metastore has completed but before actual table creation happens. Second concern which is a bigger concern is that it adds load on metastore server (if running as independent server) and on backend sql server to service these additional requests. Ideally, all such checks should be bundled together in a create table call to MetaStore (instead of few of them being done in SemanticAnalyzer) which then do all the checks and then take appropriate action. This will help for both concerns as first it will reduce extra calls and second if there is a need of multiple calls on mysql they can potentially be done in a scope of one transaction.  

, I see. Could you point me to where in code this "create table call to MetaStore" is done? 

If it is done at the moment of executing a task, I think it will be better to check for existence of the database 2 times - once at the moment of Semantic Analysis and once during the transaction. The reason is, if database doesn't exist from the beginning we can faster tell user about it and we use less resources (especially if table is created as select). Furthermore the null-pointer exception this Jira is about is thrown before the task starts execution, so if that check for database existence was only during the task execute, we would need to "wrap" that null pointer exception and "carry it" until that moment.   , Sigh. I typed in my reply yesterday but lost it when jira went down : (

Semantic Analyzer creates tasks which are then later executed in Driver::execute() In this case DDLTask gets created. Actual execution of this happens in HiveMetaStore::create_table_core()

Apart from CTAS, it never make sense to do it twice, since metastore operation is the only thing happening in create table statement. For CTAS, it has already been special cased, where it make such a check in Semantic Analysis.

NPE arises because Hive::getDatabases swallows NoSuchObjectException and instead returns null. We can either fix that so that it throws the exception or can check for null at the time of usage., Cancelling the patch.

Robert, please address Ashutosh's comments , Done and done (hopefully).

NoSuchObjectException can't be propagated further since that would require changes to ThriftHiveMetastore., This has started to look good. Robert, can you update the diff on RB. I have few minor comments., Thank you. I always add the current diff to RB, so it's always at head: https://reviews.apache.org/r/2426/diff/#index_header, Oh. Since RB is not posting back on jira (earlier it used to). I have left couple of comments on RB. , In order for RB to post back to JIRA, you have to set the Bugs field in the RB diff (e.g. to HIVE-2510 in this case)., Ok, thank you for this advice, I will try to make sure to do that in the future. ,

Review request for Yongqiang He, Ning Zhang and Kevin Wilfong.


Summary
-------

Now when creating table in specific database, if that database doesn't exist Hive will return an error informing about that, instead of throwing Null Pointer Exception. Null Pointer happens during semantic analysis, so it seems reasonable to return an error before the code that would throw null pointer (Warehouse.getDatabasePath()) executes.


This addresses bug HIVE-2510.

, It would be better to check for table existence and db existence together in CTAS within analyzeCreateTable(). Its little awkward that we check for table existence first and db existence later. But, I don't you want you to force into doing another patch. Will leave it upto committers. Otherwise, looks good to me. ,
