[Few comments:

- non should be named none
- The enums should be mr, tez and none (that way you don't have a naming conflict between the boolean flag and the enum value)
- You can handle any conversion string <-> enum in the valueOf method itself. If you really don't recognize the input an error is probably appropriate.
, Updated to address comments. valueOf cannot be over written for enums so implemented a new method for the same., Fixed small issue in HBaseQTestUtil in .3, Committed to branch. Thanks Vikram!]
