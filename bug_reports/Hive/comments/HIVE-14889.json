[One approach to solve this issue is to mask the values of all the environment variables which have "password" in them. I have tested this approach and it is a one-line change.

The other approach which I can think of is to introduce another config or (reuse "hive.conf.hidden.list" configuration) for environment variables and HiveServer2 will skip providing these environment values.

[~spena] [~dlo] What do you think? Let me know if you have any better ideas. I am not sure if we should remove all the environment variables from  the output to keep it backwards compatible., I think the best approach would be to avoid printing the environment variables on the client side as it might contain other sensitive values for users that we don't know. However, we don't know the impact of removing this, so with your first approach to mask all variables that contain 'password' or 'pass' works should be good., [~spena] Can you please review the patch?,
