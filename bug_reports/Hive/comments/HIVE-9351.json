ATTACHMENT ID: 12691730 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, This is a WebHCat only change and test failures above are not related.  They also failed in prior bot run., Thanks [~thejas] for the review, Should the new guidelines in hcatalog/src/test/e2e/templeton/README.txt be documented in the wiki?

{code}
+Running on Tez
+1. set up Tez as in http://tez.apache.org/install.html
+2. set hive.execution.engine=tez in hive-site.xml (actually is this needed?)
+3. add hive.execution.engine=tez to templeton.hive.properties in webhcat-site.xml
+4. add to mapred-env.sh/yarn-env.sh (as you defined these in step 1)
+export TEZ_VERSION=0.5.3
+export TEZ_JARS=/Users/ekoifman/dev/apache-tez-client-${TEZ_VERSION}
+export TEZ_CONF_DIR=${TEZ_JARS}/conf
+export HADOOP_CLASSPATH=${TEZ_CONF_DIR}:${TEZ_JARS}/*:${TEZ_JARS}/lib/*:${HADOOP_CLASSPATH}
+(w/o this you'll see something like "java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/tez/dag/api/SessionNotRunning")
{code}, none of the other steps in this README are on wiki (AFAIK), so I don't think so.
If there is a section on wiki at all about running webhcat e2e tests, it should have a pointer to this readme but otherwise there is nothing to document here., Okay, then no doc needed.  Thanks [~ekoifman].]
