ATTACHMENT ID: 12690535 - PreCommit-HIVE-SPARK-Build, +1 it looks ok to me as it seems this is used just to determine whether session can be reused, but I admit I'm not too familiar with this code., Maybe I don't fully understand the code, but it seems a little concerning that session is reused purely based on user name. Hive supports multiple sessions for the same user, and we don't want such session is reused.

I also have a feeling that we don't have any session reuse (though we have code here and there for that). If that's the case, we'd rather just get rid of the code.

[~chengxiang li], could you comment on this?, We does reuse session for queries from same client, [~xuefuz], I verified before and i just did again, just may not work in the way we thought before.
HiveServer2 introduce a new approach to manager session, every RPC call references a session ID which the server then maps to persistent session state,the linear mapping is like: Hive Client->SessionHandler(session id inside)\->HiveSessionImpl->SessionState.  For Hive on Spark, as we would like to share the singleton SparkContext for a user session, we may expand the linear mapping like: Hive Client->SessionHandler(session id inside)\-> HiveSessionImpl->SessionState->SparkSession->SparkClient->RemoteDriver->SparkContext, with only exception: create new SparkSession while spark configuration update.
Hive Client->SessionHandler(session id inside)->HiveSessionImpl mapping should already ensure that whether Hive session should reused, I think we do not need to check again by user name in SparkSessionManager unless we have other reasons to create new SparkSession beside spark configuration update.
[~chinnalalam], I just read related code today, not sure if i fully understand it, do you have any idea about it?, I have verified this code, reusing the session is not happening because as [~chengxiang li] explained 
Hive Client->SessionHandler(session id inside)-> HiveSessionImpl->SessionState->SparkSession this linear mapping is maintained.
Updated the patch by removing that code., +1 pending on test.,
