[I like the idea of 3 retries - can we put that into a function and let both jobScratchDir and emptyScratchDir call it?
, JobScratchDir is not created by hive - I think hadoop creates it somewhere - hive just specifies it is the output directory., +1. Will test and commit.

, Committed. Thanks Namit!
