[Hi [~gopalv],
can you please explain the error with the LLAP UI? The regexp should only match for the context root of the web application, is it somehow redirecting the LLAP UI requests as well?
If you want then I can take a look at it and provide a fix., Yeah, LLAP uses the same HttpServer impl.

{code}
HttpServer.Builder builder =
        new HttpServer.Builder("llap").setPort(this.port).setHost(bindAddress);
{code}

Before this regex rewrite it would load "hive-webapps/llap/index.html" automatically.

After that 

{code}
HTTP ERROR 500

Problem accessing /hiveserver2.jsp. Reason:

    JSP support not configured
{code}, Ok this seems easy to fix, I would move this logic to the builder so that you can build an http server with or without context root rewriting, I probably should have done it like this in the first place.
Would you like me to do it? (Since I broke it to begin with....), Sure, no worries - go ahead with the patch, I can review/test.

The fallback default can be "/index.html" (or specified root path, in case of HS2)., As discussed set default rewrite url to '/index.html' and added a unit test for the LLAP UI., +1 pending tests, Reuploading patch because pre-commit didn't run., Reuploading a third time (same patch) to run the pre-commit tests.,

would you mind taking a look at the fix? Unit tests seem fine, but if you have any suggestions then I'd be happy to incorporate them into the patch.
, Pushed to master, thanks [~zsombor.klara] for the fix.]
