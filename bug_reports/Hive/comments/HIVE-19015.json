[[~vihangk1] You may need the fixes in HIVE-19019 in order to make progress on this one.  (In fact, if you could give that one a quick +1 tests pending it would help me!)., [~vihangk1] seems like the vectorized Parquet reader does not handle complex types as LIST elements.

I can add a new HiveConf variable to disallow non-primitive LIST elements for Parquet input format in the Vectorizer.  Sound like a plan?, And, HIVE-19016 seems similar., [~vihangk1] This is the same nested complex type problem as it is not yet implement in Parquet vectorized reader. I will get this done together with HIVE-19016. 

The nested complex type handling will be much complex than primitives but fewer cases. My current thought is for root columns which is primitive or List, Struct and Map with primitives, we will go with the current implementation as fast path.  When we found a root column with nested complex types, we will go with a tree reader which can handling the definition level and repetition level properly.]
