ATTACHMENT ID: 12694667 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~brocknoland] Can you help review the change? Should be trivial. The failed test case was not due  to the change. , Truncate is implemented as deleting the folder and recreating the folder while the file permission is not carried over. The fix is to recreating the folder with the existing permission., Change looks great! Unfortunately the test doesn't do much because of path masking. You might consider a test similar to {{TestJDBCDriver2}} but in a new class since that is getting bloated. [~szehon] also has a test somewhere which tests file persm., Yes, I hit the same issue when trying to make a test for permission inheritance that does manual comparison of permission using HDFS api's.  You can put a new test in FolderPermissionTestBase, it will get executed by subclasses TestExtendedAcls and TestFolderPermissions.  Else, you can make a new test that is similar., Thanks Brock. Yeah, the path is masked. I will take a look at TestJDBCDriver2., Great. I will follow your test case. Thanks. [~szehon], Hey Aihua, this looks good but a thought occurred to me.  We would need to also make sure the HDFS extendedAcl's are preserved in case of permission inheritance (this is in additional to file permission).  So the code would look like:
{code}
        HdfsFileStatus fullFileStatus = shim.getFullFileStatus(conf, fs, location);
        try {
          shim.setFullFileStatus(conf, fullFileStatus, fs, location);
        } catch (Exception e) {
          LOG.warn("Error setting permissions of " + location, e);
        }
{code}
You can check FileUtils as a reference.  I believe we won't need to add an additional test as by putting it in this base test, TestExtendedAcls will also test this as well., New patch updated to use fileStatus approach to consider the ACL permission. , Thanks Aihua!  Just one more small thing, can we catch the exception and log it?  Some file system doesnt support extended Acl's, we only want to make the best effort., Got it. Thanks, Szehon. Just updated., +1 looks good, thanks a lot.,
