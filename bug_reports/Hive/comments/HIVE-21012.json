[This is because of a bug in Calcite which [~kgyrtkirk] has already fixed. After upgrading to calcite-1.18 this should go away., I've fixed this a similar issue for IN that somehow needed fixes on both sides.
There seems to be some more descendants of SpecialOperator: I see *concat,truncate,todate* and *between* at first glance..

* I think *truncate* and *to_date* could be probably changed to be an SqlFunction
* probably *concat* as well - if we are ok with the prefix format.
* for *between* I think we might need a specific unparse

, 'Between' unparse is already included in HIVE-20822 (waiting for upgrade to Calcite 1.18).]
