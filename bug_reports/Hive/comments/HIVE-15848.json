[this bug is present on the current master branch, All my efforts to leave the optimization enabled in this case have failed - however I still feel that it might be saved somehow.

I've encountered a very intresting thing while working on this: for the second case the optimization didn't kick in because the key order is permutated wrt to the other RS - I'm not sure what's causing this - but it may prevent this optimisation from happening in other cases as well. {{ReduceSinkDeDuplication#sameKeys}}

I propose to disable reduce deduplication in cases like this:

patch#1: when the about to be removed reduce sink is also doing distinct related work(DistinctColumnIndices) - the optimization is disabled.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12854665 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Thanks  [~kgyrtkirk], I think  childDistinctColumnIndices should less than 2, the optimization is  enabled when childDistinctColumnIndices only have one key.
PR:  https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/150/commits/a4fc3af4c77beafe11e3e4188571177862d64e4e
, [~bill] seems like you've came to a similar conclusion :)
I've adjusted the patch. ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12854961 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, It will be ideal to migrate these optimizations to calcite tree by writing an calcite rule where implementing these optimizations are more straight forward. In the meanwhile its alright to turn off these optimization in this particular case. 
+1, It would be great to have this in calcite...however I'm not yet familiar enough with it - but I will keep it in mind.
Pushed to master, thank you [~ashutoshc] for the review.
