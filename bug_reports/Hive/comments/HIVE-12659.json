[[~sseth] and [~gopalv] fyi.., This is related to the jira which attempts to detect instances of an LLAP cluster going down.
Ideally, we should be able to get enough information from the registry in Zookeeper to make a decision about whether to continuously attempt to run the query, or exit.
Alternately, we can start tracking the status of individual nodes to decide that an LLAP cluster is in an 'unhealthy' state.]
