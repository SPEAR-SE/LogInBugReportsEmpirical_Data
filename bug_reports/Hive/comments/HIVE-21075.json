[Could we add the index on CD_ID column? Any reason why we don't have an index on that? [~pvary] [~ychena]?, [~karthik.manamcheri], we can add the index, but adding the index alone can not speed up the count(1) query fast enough to match the performance of query SELECT * FROM "SDS" "A0" WHERE "A0"."CD_ID" = $1 limit 1 ., [~karthik.manamcheri], [~ychena] Sorry for my fast respons which I posted before reading the whole context. New years mailbox cleanup... maybe the only relevant part: Please keep this in mind when testing solutions. Seemingly small changes in CD related queries can multiply when having big number of existing partitions.]
