HIVE-3820: Decimal literals

When the HIVE-2693 gets committed, users are going to see this behavior:

hive> select cast(3.14 as decimal) from decimal_3 limit 1;
3.140000000000000124344978758017532527446746826171875

That's intuitively incorrect but is the case because 3.14 (double) is being converted to BigDecimal because of which there is a precision mismatch.

We should consider creating a new literal for expressing constants of Decimal type as Gunther suggested in HIVE-2693.

, Patch looks good. You have chosen D. I wonder if other systems allow d or BD as well. Do you know if sql standard says anything for it?, [~ashutoshc]: As far as I know there's no SQL standard for it. The other numeric types also do not seem to follow any standard. I picked D because it doesn't clash with other literals and seems natural for "decimal"., Since we also have Double type. I wonder folks will confuse D for Double. Feels like BD will avoid that potential confusion. What do you think?, .2 has BD as the ending for decimal literals., [~ashutoshc]bd is probably a little less confusing. I've updated the patch accordingly., I've abandoned HIVE-2586 but still believe literal float/double type would be useful. Isn't it?, In the integer world we have literals for all int types except integer itself (which is the default int type). Double/float could follow the same model: Double is the default, little need to have a special literal, but for float it makes sense to me. 

Decimal is a special case - since numeric values default to double a literal is necessary to separate from that type.

Glad you pointed HIVE-2586 out, it does validate Ashutosh' thinking and makes another case for BD instead of D., +1 running tests., Committed to trunk. Thanks, Gunther!, Integrated in Hive-trunk-h0.21 #2026 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hive-trunk-h0.21/2026/])
