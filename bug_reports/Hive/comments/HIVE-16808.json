ATTACHMENT ID: 12870880 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, Hi,

Just a quick question. Might not be relevant, but I would like to understand the reasons.
Why do not just encode the uri.getPath() part? We are expecting attacks when the path is "foo+bar" against "foo%20bar"?

Thanks, 
Peter ,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12870880 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, [~thejas], could you review please, Wonder if "+" is the only character allowed in hdfs, but not uri. Is it safer to do just string manipulation rather than encoding/decoding in addUserHomeDirectoryIfApplicable?, if you look at decode() - "+" is the only one
the alternative is to cut&paste the decode() code (minus the case for "+") to Hive - this doesn't seem any better, I see. +1., [~pvary],
we aren't intentionally encoding anything - some library methods we use encode in UTF-8 so we need to decode it back to Unicode.
Unfortunately, the encoding code leaves {noformat}"+" as is but decoding turns "+" into " "{noformat} - that's why there is that mess in the patch to work around this., [~ekoifman]: All of the unit test cases can be solved by this code:
{code}
    if (uri.getPath().isEmpty()) {
      String newPath = "/user/" + user;
      uri = UriBuilder.fromUri(uri).replacePath(newPath).build();
    } else if (!new Path(uri.getPath()).isAbsolute()) {
      return "/user/" + user + "/" + origPathStr;
    } // no work needed for absolute paths
{code}

I spent some time to come up with a relative path where we need the uri conversion, but was unable to find one.
Could you help me here please?

Thanks,
Peter, patch 3 removes dependency on UriBuilder and encoding/decoding issues with it.,
