[Currently, Hive wonâ€™t have Cygwin dependency issues for runtime and building. But we still need to enable Cygwin to run unit tests for Hive. One workaround is adding several executables in %PATH%.  Cygwin has about 220 executables to mock the Linux environment. We may only need around 10-20 executables. The following is a list:
1.	bash.exe                                                                                                                                                  
2.	cat.exe                                                                                                                                                   
3.	cp.exe                                                                                                                                                    
4.	cut.exe                                                                                                                                                   
5.	date.exe

7.	echo.exe

This is a superset of necessary executables. Some of them may not be needed. Possible unified solutions include using Java or Python to rewrite these executable files. ]
