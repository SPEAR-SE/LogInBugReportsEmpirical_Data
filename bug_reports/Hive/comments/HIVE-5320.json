[Please review the attached patch for the fix., Marking patch available to tests run., I am not sure we want this. Whole point of Object Inspector based design is object reuse and lazy evaluation. By defensively copying, we are giving up on that. Agreed this put an onus on serde implementers to do "right thing" but thats how it is. I suggest you go with the option 1 in the options you have listed., I agree that is the long term solution, but until we can pull in the next release, it makes sense to commit a work around, no? Along with a JIRA to track the real fix. Is it possible to get the OI's name at that point and only do the copy if we are working with the bad IO?, It seemed a bug on json-serde(which was on hive before, too) not on hive. Why should we do walk-around for this?, Agree that this is mainly caused by the improper implementation from json-serde, but is there anything Hive can do to better cope with this kind of unexpected behavior or prevent it from happening again? To provide clear documentations for its related SerDe APIs like that in ListObjectInspector?, Hey guys, for some reason I thought we shipped the json serde. Since we don't ship it I think I don't think we should commit a work around.

Therefore I think we should resolve this as won't fix., [~ctang.cloudera] I am not sure if it is easy to detect such a badly behaving serde. This is not something easily enforceable. So, only thing I can see is to improve on our documentation so that serde writers are well aware of this behavior. Lets close this one as won't fix and improve documentation on cwiki.]
