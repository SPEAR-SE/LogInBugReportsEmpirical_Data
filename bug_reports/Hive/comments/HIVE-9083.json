ATTACHMENT ID: 12688134 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, @[~ashutoshc]: Any chance I can bother you to review this one?

It's pretty small. In fact HIVE-9083, HIVE-9086 and HIVE-9118 can be reviewed as a set.
, +1, Patch doesnt apply cleanly anymore, needs a rebase., Sure thing. I'll rebase the set., This'll take longer than expected. I'm trying to do something about the increasing number of booleans in {{HMSC.dropPartitions()}}. Will post shortly. , Here's the patch rebased for trunk. I've lumped all the boolean flags for drop-partitions (and their default values) into a common class. The code's an easier read, and less prone to misfires.

(Apologies for the delay.),

ATTACHMENT ID: 12701789 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Committed to trunk. Thanks, Mithun!, Does this need to be documented, or should we wait for the command-line option?, [~leftylev]: Perhaps we should wait for HIVE-9086 to firm up. This is only the API change, which the javadoc hopefully covers., This issue has been fixed and released as part of the 1.2.0 release. If you find an issue which seems to be related to this one, please create a new jira and link this one with new jira.]
