[Attaching patch.

Looks like we can remove service, serde, commons, shims and metastore out of hbase-handler/pom.xml. "shims", "commons" and "serde" are already part of the hive-exec uber jar. "metastore" and "service" are not needed. "metastore" anyway downloaded as transitive dependency of hive-exec. Now pom deps looks similar to [0.12 pom.xml|https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/public/org/apache/hive/hive-hbase-handler/0.12.0/hive-hbase-handler-0.12.0.pom].

No build issues found. Tried:
{{mvn clean install package -DskipTests -Phadoop-1,dist}} and
{{mvn clean install package -DskipTests -Phadoop-2,dist}}
, Likely my fault during the mavenization project... +1 pending tests.,
