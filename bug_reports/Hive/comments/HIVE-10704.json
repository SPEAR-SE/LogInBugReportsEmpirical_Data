Jason, can you "rbt post -g yes" and attach the link?
, Patch v2 - removed redundant calls. Also changed the logic so that the memory for all hashtables are computed at the same time. If we have to do the fallback logic for one table, we should probably do it for all tables., RB link at https://reviews.apache.org/r/34287/, would like to include to 1.2 branch,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12734732 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Test failures are unrelated., [~apivovarov]
Ditto for this one. , Mostafa, can you check RB link? I'm not sure it shows HIVE-10704.3.patch, Mostafa, can you check RB link? I'm not sure it shows HIVE-10704.3.patch, Done, command line rb was giving me some headache. , What is the negative side of dividing memory equally?
If we have 3 tables  (1KB, 0B, 2MB) how we should divided the memory? (Map<Integer, Long> tableMemorySizes). Is dividing memory equally the best solution?
Maybe we should treat 0B table as 1B table and give it minimum amount of the memory., Table size of 0 is usually an error in the statistics and the actual table can be arbitrary big, so evenly dividing the memory is a much safer bet.
And in the case you mentioned above each hash table will get hive.auto.convert.join.noconditionaltask.size / 3.
By default this is Container size/3 which is more than enough for smaller tables.
