[Removing fix version of 1.2.2 - fix version is supposed to be marked after commit. I assume the intent was to have target version of 1.2.2., Also, [~vaidyand], could you please verify if this problem exists in master?, HIVE-15373 goes into more detail of the actual problem., Removing target 1.2.2 (minor upgrade) and adding target 1.3 as there is no patch yet.]
