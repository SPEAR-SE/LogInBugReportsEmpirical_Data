[We've seen this to. Our workaround is a shell script that looks something like this:

{code}
TMP_DIR=/tmp/hive-$$
mkdir -p $TMP_DIR
HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS="-Dhive.downloaded.resources.dir=$TMP_DIR"
hive $@
rc=$?
rm -r $TMP_DIR
exit $rc
{code}

This solution eliminates the problem in our case., Hey Joe,

Thanks for the work around, seems to work well for me also. I'll look into the possibility of changing the parent directory as well within the HiveConf to do something similar. 

Cheers,
Chris, HIVE-3431 should fix this issue. Please reopen if you find otherwise.]
