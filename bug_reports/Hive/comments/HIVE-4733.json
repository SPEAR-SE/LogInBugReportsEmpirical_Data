HIVE-4733 HiveLockObjectData is not compared properly

ret = ret && (clientIp == null) ? target.getClientIp() == null :
          clientIp.equals(target.getClientIp());

seemed intended to be

ret = ret && (clientIp == null ? target.getClientIp() == null :
          clientIp.equals(target.getClientIp()));

  Hi Navis,

  Great catch on the ordering issue!  I do have one minor question about the change to ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.  I am not expert there so I might be totally off base. :)

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lockmgr/zookeeper/ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java:448 Ignoring this exception I am less sure about.  Too be sure I am no expert on this class! :)  But I read this method as:

      delete mylock
      if not parent.hasChildren():
        delete parent

  Is that your reading?  If so, I wonder if we should let this exception be thrown because it could be an indication of correctness issues?

  One comment about a new exception I saw.

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lockmgr/zookeeper/ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java:456 Looks like we still have an issue with getChildren(). I am able to get get the following exception on trunk.

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lockmgr/zookeeper/ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java:448 It seemed that this fix is merged with other one which was in progress. I'm also not expert on this class and even haven't read intensively. Can I ask your opinion? Should we return here leaving some log messages?

  Hi Navis,

  Once again, thanks for the patch!  I expressed by thoughts in two comments in ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java.

  Cheers!

  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lockmgr/zookeeper/ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java:448 Hi,

  I am not a committer so what I say is certainly not binding! :) I've done a decent amount of testing of this code via HIVE-4759 and I haven't hit the issue where the zLock.getPath() has already been deleted. Therefor my preference would be to leave this specific delete() as is.
  ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/lockmgr/zookeeper/ZooKeeperHiveLockManager.java:456 The fix around the parent delete "zkpClient.delete(name)" wasn't sufficient. We could either do this in this JIRA or in a follow on JIRA but the getChildren() call also needs to go in the try{ } catch(KeeperException.NoNodeException).

  Addressed comments
  1. rollback try/catch on zk.delete(path)
  2. include zk.getChildren() into try/catch clause
