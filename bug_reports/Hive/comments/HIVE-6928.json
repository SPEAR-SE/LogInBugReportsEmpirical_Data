[In this example the length of the row is more than 1000 characters. These kind of outputs showing in table format wont be look good. When ever the row length is bigger than width present that in vertical format (decide this in run time).,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12642628, Thanks [~chinnalalam] for the fix.  

One minor nit here, as there is no review-board, do you think it would be better to call BufferedRows constructor width argument to be 'consoleWidth' for clarity, to disambiguate from row width.

I was also wondering do we need an upper-bound as now it will show entire result length even if its huge, but Hive CLI did not have that either., Hi Szehon Ho, Thanks for reviewing the patch. Reworked the patch.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12650101, [~chinnalalam] could you please update RB with your latest patch? Thanks., I have a few concerns about this patch.
This will change the output format on the fly. It is possible that for a query that was returning results in table format would suddenly change to vertical format when some records in the input changes. This sort of surprise is not good. I agree that truncating columns is also not good.
I think we should instead improve the table format to wrap around the lines instead of truncating them. Or look at how other databases command lines tend to format their results.

There is also a change proposed in HIVE-7224 that changes default to incremental output to avoid OOM. This patch will result in disabling table format output with that option.
, The concern does make sense.  I only have mysql now, and saw they are wrapping long lines by default.

I dont have that much DB-CLI exp, but Beeline is the only one I've seen that by default sets each Row's max-width to be the console width at startup time.  Then it keeps truncating to that size even if you resize the window, it's not a great experience.  Changing the default (table format) to wrap long lines like mysql sounds better to better.  Thoughts?, Cancel the patch until the above concerns are addressed., A patch which change the default table format wrapping long lines like mysql is attached. In this patch, an option (--truncateTable) is added which is false by default. It means table output format will wrap the long lines when it is set to false. If user wants to truncate long lines,  add option --truncate in beeline command. Besides that, we can file a bug to add ellipsis at the end of truncated item in order to highlighting it is truncated., The latest patch looks good to me. Can we have a RB for this? I submit the patch to allow tests to run., review board entry was created:
https://reviews.apache.org/r/23541, Reattach the same patch to trigger the test run., I have started wondering why test wasn't triggered. Reattach and try again., reattach file since there is a blank in the file name in order to trigger the hive qa,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12656188, The test failures don't seem related to the patch. I have seen them in other test runs also. Will commit the patch shortly., Patch committed to trunk. Thanks to Chinna and ferdinand for the contribution., The --truncateTable option needs to be documented in the Beeline section of HiveServer2 Clients (with a version note and link to this jira).

* [HiveServer2 Clients -- Beeline Command Options | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], Thanks, Lefty., The patch does not have a test that verifies linewrapping actually works. It would be useful to have a test for it. Created HIVE-7941 to track that.
[~Ferd] Would you like to take a shot at it ?
, Added information about truncateTable Beeline option in:
[https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions], This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
