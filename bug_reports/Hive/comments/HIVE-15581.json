[Have you tried it with Hive on Tez? Not saying it will help but if the problem is specific to Hive on MapReduce it's not likely it will ever be fixed., [~cartershanklin]
I tried Tez and the query was executed correctly, so it may well be a problem specific to MapReduce.
Thank you for the suggestion.

Results w/ Tez:
