[Vladimir, in this case, do we really need a stack trace? It is mostly caused by ClassNotFound etc when creating an input format instance with the class name.
Is there some error that can only be found from the stack trace?, I think so. Exception could be thrown not only from Class.forName, but also from Class.newInstance. Actually it was my case as due to incorrect settings constructor of my InputFormat was throwing an exception (and this exception was being swallowed).

Also, it's a general rule in most java projects (to add exception as a cause esception). More information in stacktrace never hurts :) 
(Although I'm not sure that Hive should follow this rule), Thanks for the explanation.  Yes, there is no harm to do that.
I will test and commit it., Vladimir Klimontovich, please assign this issue to yourself. 
, Well, I can't assign this issue. Seems like I don't have enough permissions, Vladimir, can you update the patch? After that, i will test and commit it., Updated patch for trunk attached., +1. Will commit if tests pass., Carl, is it already committed ?, @Namit: No, I forgot to check the tests. I'm rerunning them now., Committed. Thanks Vladimir!
