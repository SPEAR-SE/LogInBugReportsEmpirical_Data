ATTACHMENT ID: 12738129 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~jxiang], could you explain why the thread might go dead and is there a way to prevent this rather than taking a "detect and fix" approach?, We have a pool of thrift worker threads.  If idle long enough, some threads will be released. I am testing a new patch that cache it in the session and clean it up when the session is closed., Couldn't tid be reused? Overall I don't quite understand the mechanism of the leak - don't threadlocals for dead threads get GCed? Maybe finalize can be added to take care of connections in such case, I have a new patch in testing now.  The code is changed. As to GC, it is not reliable. We don't know when it is invoked. When the session is closed, it should be the right time to close the HMS connection too., Well it's a tradeoff... the leak will definitely be fixed by finalizer. I don't think we have the pressure to close the connection ASAP.  It's a much simpler fix than the attached patch that reimplements threadlocal. As much as I dislike Java, and GC in particular I'd rather not do that.
Other patch welcome :), New patch does not use this threadlocal any more., Attached patch v2. It is also on RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/35256/
The new patch closes the connection when the Hive session is closed.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12738657 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, Changed the patch a little. Not synchronized for close(). It should be an user error to closing a session while it is still in use.,
