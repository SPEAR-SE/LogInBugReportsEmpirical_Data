[Looks like the input field name is lowercased before comparison in StructTypeInfo.getStructFieldTypeInfo(), but the actual struct field names are not lowercased during the comparison. So I'm wondering if these field names should have been in lowercase in the first place. Patch will automatically lowercase the struct field names when the StructTypeInfo is created.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12673776, Looks like automatically lowercasing the struct field names has a bad effect on Avro. Patch v3 simply makes the field lookup case-insensitive.
One question, it looks like HCatFieldSchema.getTypeString() explicitly lowercases its result. Will this cause any issues with Avro?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12674245, Test failures do not look related., [~sushanth] [~alangates] does this one look ok?, +1.

The change itself looks good to me. As to whether or not AvroSerDe works with HCatFieldSchema, you're not making the matters worse with this patch, since HCatFieldSchema already normalizes(lowercases) it. That can be a separate matter to fix if needed.

Also +cc-ing [~ekoifman] so he's aware of this., Also, looking at JsonSerDe, that's not affected by HCatFieldSchema lowercasing, since it uses that only for reading, and for writing, takes the types from the appropriate StructObjectInspector passed in to the serialize method for it. If the AvroSerDe behaves similarly, HCatFieldSchema doing the lowercasing should only affect reading, which is good. If not, we need to make that more robust for definitions of case-sensitivity while working with hive., [~vikram.dixit] I would like to add this to 0.14., Committed to trunk/branch-0.14, Does this need documentation or just a release note?, Release note (if even that).  As far as I'm concerned this was just a bug., Okay, thanks., This has been fixed in 0.14 release. Please open new jira if you see any issues.
