[Ping [~sseth]. Please review., +1. Looks good. If this is not expected to be hit very often - a log line indicating no readers could be useful., Updated to include test cases and another case where the depending on the order of initialization of the input, we can get stuck., Added a log statement as well as suggested by Sid., Should I commit this?, Unit test results haven't come back yet. We should wait for that.,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12772906 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~sershe] I think the only test failure of concern is the TestMiniLlapCliDriver. Should I be running a specific test here?, It looks like the test failed entirely, before even initialization. That is suspicious... you can try locally or resubmit the patch., I see it also happens on other JIRAs... would need to see if something broke it, Removing 1.2.2 as this is an improvement on top of HIVE-11356 which is being reverted from branch-1.2]
