[Should be able to run below commands and change the ownership
{noformat}
alter table tb1 set owner user user1;
alter table tb1 set owner role role1;

{noformat}, I see that Hive {{PrincipalType}} has a value for {{group}} as well. Do you plan to use it as well?, It will support the same values than ALTER DATABASE SET OWNER which I noticed on the HiveParser.g that also supports user, group or role; but the documentation on the wiki mentions only user or role. I will make sure to update the wiki of both commands., [~vgarg], I wasn't aware of the freeze of branch-3 and I did already commit the first 2 patches of this umbrella Jira last week. There is still one pending patch (in review now) which completes the command. Do you think I can commit this patch to branch-3 so it is available in 3.0?]
