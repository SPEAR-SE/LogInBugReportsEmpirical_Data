[Made a patch. [~ekoifman] can you have it reviewed, thanks!, I think there are other places in the schema that have the same issue.  This needs to be made consistent for all tables.  Unfortunately columns that seem to store partition name are named differently in different tables.

some that look like potential candidates (but not an exhaustive list)
part_col_stats.partition_name
partition_events.partition_name
partition_keys.pkey_name
partition_params.param_value, Thanks [~ekoifman]! I'd take a look at them to get all partition name replications., Made 2nd patch that keeps partition name and SDS location type consistent.
[~ekoifman] can you review it? Thanks!, Most of the diffs change varchar(767) to nvarchar(767), but in some cases the starting types are varchar(128) or varchar(4000).  Are you sure these are partition keys?, I don't think we need to change length, right?, They are partition name with multi-bytes support., I was asking if you are sure those fields represent partition names.  If yes, they should be nvarchar.
As far as length, it seems odd that we store the same exact value in fields of different sizes...  but perhaps this is beyond the scope of this bug.
[~sushanth], could you look at this patch?  do you know anything about the tables that seem to store partition values but the length of fields is not 767 as in most cases?, HIVE-9456 is going to change all varchar to nvarchar in 0.15 and provide upgrade script form 0.14 to 0.15, so there's no consistency issue like the case. 

Marked it as won't fix.]
