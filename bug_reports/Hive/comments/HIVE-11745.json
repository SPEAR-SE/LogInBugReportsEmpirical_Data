[The issue can not be reproduced in local setup, so it works fine with local file system.
It can be reproduced in cluster mode. It seems that hdfs can not mkdir or rename a folder whose parent folder does not exist. Make the fix by
creating parent folders needed. Attached the patch, the minimr test will be failed without the fix. , Need code review.,

, Thanks, looks mostly good.  One last question, why does it need to be minimr test and not just regular Cli test? ,

{noformat}, Hi Yongzhi, thanks, I wonder if you can answer my last question?  The test was a CliDriver test in patch 1 which seemed fine with me., [~szehon], sorry I can not find what's your last question is in the review board. Is that adding the permission test? (It is in the patch 2).

The test was a CliDriver test in patch 1 which seemed fine with me. It is true, it will fail in the minimr test for it only does not work with hdfs file system without the fix, the CliDriver test works fine for it uses local file system. 
Thanks, I meant the last question here, ok you answered it, +1, Thanks [~szehon] for reviewing it. , Committed to master, thanks Yongzhi!, Backported to branch-1 and branch-1.2 since this looks like a useful bugfix to have., Doc note:  Added TODOC1.3 label because use of multiple partition_specs is not specified in the DDL wikidoc.  (Also because we don't have a separate TODOC label for 1.2.2.)  This should be mentioned with version information in the DDL doc and the Exchange Partition doc.

* [DDL -- Alter Partition -- ExchangePartition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/LanguageManual+DDL#LanguageManualDDL-ExchangePartition]
* [Exchange Partition | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Exchange+Partition], Updated the docs., Looks good.  Removed the TODOC1.3 label.

I changed the links from macros to regular web links because JIRA macros don't work.  (They might look fine to you, but for me they show this error:  JIRA Issues Macro: The JIRA server returned a trusted apps error: USER_UNKNOWN;	Unknown User: {0};	["leftyl"].)

Thanks, [~asears].]
