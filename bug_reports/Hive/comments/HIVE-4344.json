[sxyuan requested code review of "HIVE-4344 [jira] CREATE VIEW fails when redundant casts are rewritten".

Reviewers: kevinwilfong

See JIRA for a description of the problem. This change relaxes the constraints on translations. Previously, if a new translation overlaps with an existing one, one must be a prefix or suffix of the other. This allows the case when one is completely contained inside the other.

TEST PLAN
  Run tests.
