[The issue is actually that the column is not found.
Adding this:
{noformat}
      if (fieldNames.contains(colName)) {
        fieldIdx = fieldNames.indexOf(colName);
+     } else {
+      String s = "Cannot find field for: " + colName + " in ";
+       for (String fn : fieldNames) {
+        s += fn + ", ";
+      }
+       LOG.error(s);
+       continue;
      }
{noformat}

To one test that gets this on llap branch after merge produces

{noformat}, Patch that fixes the exception. The test that was failing on LLAP branch with this error now produces the same result as on master... [~prasanth_j] should there be a separate fix for why the column is not found?,

ATTACHMENT ID: 12742671 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, [~prasanth_j] ping?, Can you replace the string concatenation and log line with
LOG.warn("Cannot find field for: " + colName + " in " + fieldNames);
which will do the same thing.

Otherwise looks good +1., Also verified the acid queries authorization_delete.* does pass with this patch., I added it to my nightlies and I see some strange logs from Query27

{code}, This is the question... is it actually supposed to happen?
I am assuming before the patch, the query would actually have some fields that match where it throws the exception in other cases (the one in this jira), so it would use the default fieldId 0 for all these fields and do random stuff.
[~prasanth_j] can you elaborate on this code? looks like it never actually works properly, at least in some queries, because column names don't match., [~sershe] and [~gopalv].. getRawDataSizeOfColumns was never intended to be used inside hive at the time of writing. Its added as a pure convenience method for tools using ORC outside of hive like pig et. al. The reason being all other tools will write the actual column names but hive writes internal names which is weird. Hive uses getRawDataSizeFromColIndices method for getting the raw data size of projected columns (used by ANALYZE and StatsTask). I am going to put up another patch for uncompressed size in ORC split which will not use the getRawDataSizeOfColumns interface. The reason currently we are seeing this logs is because of this line in OrcInputFormat 
{code}
List<String> projCols = ColumnProjectionUtils.getReadColumnNames(context.conf);
{code}

This is actually a dead code which does not do any thing. So its safe to ignore these warnings for now., fixed everywhere]
