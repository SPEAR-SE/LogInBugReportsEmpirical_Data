[kevinwilfong requested code review of "HIVE-4430 [jira] Semantic analysis fails in presence of certain literals in on clause".

Reviewers: gangtimliu, njain

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4430

When users include a bigint literal (a number suffixed with 'L') in the conditions in the on clause the query will fail with, e.g.
FAILED: SemanticException 0L encountered with 0 children
I haven't tried it yet, but I suspect the same is true for other, lesser used literals.

TEST PLAN
  Added testcases for lesser used literals.
