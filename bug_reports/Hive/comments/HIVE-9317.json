[This patch changes no code, just puts the required Apache header on the source files and moves Microsoft's copyright notice to the NOTICE file., +1., I committed this. Thanks for the review, Alan., This is not in 1.0 RC1, do we need another RC for this ? Looks like we need one. cc [~vikram.dixit] 
, I think we're ok without this in 1.0.  It's already been in several releases.  If we need to roll a new RC I agree this should go in., +1 to not rolling a new RC specifically for this one. I just want to make sure it goes into to any new RCs., Updating release version for jiras resolved in 1.0.0 .
, This issue has been fixed in Apache Hive 1.0.0. If there is any issue with the fix, please open a new jira to address it.
