[Do you have an example UDTF for this? I'm not particularly familiar with the UDTFs, but it looks like as long as you override either of the two initialize() functions (or both), you would avoid hitting this exception.

I don't think this is a backwards-compatibility issue either, as prior to HIVE-5737 GenericUDTF.initialize() was declared as abstract and thus would have required users to override the initialize() method.]
