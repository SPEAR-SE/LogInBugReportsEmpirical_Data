[Attaching patch, for review., Hi Jamie,
Can this wait a few days? I am working on a few enhancements for HIVE-7193 that also includes a change for this issue. I have most of the code ready. It will take me about a week to have it tested and uploaded for review. Thanks, Absolutely, Hey Jaime,
Apology for the delay. But I have uploaded a patch on HIVE-7193 that should address this issue. I will be attaching an updated design doc shortly that has details on the new implementation. Please let me know if you have any questions. Thank you, A more general fix for this issue has been included in HIVE-7193 that add filter support for LDAP user and groups. Users can configure the following properties to indicate multiple patterns(COMMA-separated) for DNs where users/groups can be located in LDAP.
hive.server2.authentication.ldap.groupDNPattern
hive.server2.authentication.ldap.userDNPattern

ex: uid=%s,ou=Users,DC=domain,DC=com:CN=%s,CN=Users,DC=domain,DC=com
uid=%s,ou=Groups,DC=domain,DC=com:CN=%s,CN=Groups,DC=domain,DC=com

Please provide any feedback you have on the new features. Thanks, Updating the fix status and relationship with HIVE-7193 to better indicate that there was not separate change associated with this jira.
