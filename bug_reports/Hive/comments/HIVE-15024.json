[[~gopalv] are there more logs, or a repro?, The logs are on /tmp/application_1475017598908_0409.log  on the perf-cluster.

I can download them in a couple of hours & upload them here, if you want., Hmm, log is at warn level.. if there's no repro I'll just add more detailed logging for the error case, otherwise this is hard to diagnose., Improved logging patch. Does this make sense?, [~prasanth_j] can you take a look? Thanks., [~prasanth_j] [~gopalv] ping???, Resolved in HIVE-15901]
