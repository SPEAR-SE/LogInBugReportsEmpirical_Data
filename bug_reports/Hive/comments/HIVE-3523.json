[This bug is caused by HIVE-3505 which modified the hive-log4j.properties file.

Before HIVE-3505 the hive-log4j.properties file looked like this:

{noformat}
hive.root.logger=WARN,DRFA
hive.log.dir=/tmp/${user.name}

...

# Logging Threshold
log4j.threshhold=WARN
{noformat}

And after HIVE-3505 it looks like this:

{noformat}
hive.log.threshold=WARN
hive.root.logger=${hive.log.threshold},DRFA

...

# Logging Threshold
log4j.threshold=${hive.log.threshold}
{noformat}

One not so obvious change is that we corrected a spelling mistake, changing "log4j.thresshold" to "log4j.threshold". The fact that log4j.threshold was previously misspelled meant that log4j had been using the default threshold value ALL, which is equivalent to no threshold at all. HIVE-3505 fixed the spelling mistake, which caused log4j to start using the new threshold value WARN, which explains why INFO level messages are getting filtered out even when hive.root.logger is set to INFO,console.

It's possible to work around this problem right now by setting both hive.log.threshold and hive.root.logger. For example:

hive -hiveconf hive.log.threshold=INFO -hiveconf hive.root.logger=INFO,console

  Hive Info logging is broken on trunk. hive -hiveconf hive.root.logger=INFO,console doesn't print the output of LOG.info statements to the console.
