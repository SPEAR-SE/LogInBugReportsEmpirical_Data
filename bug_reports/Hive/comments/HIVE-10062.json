[The explain results told us:
{code}
                          Map 6 (TS s2)
                                             \
Map1 (TS s1)-> Reduce 2 -> Union3 -> Reduce 4 (dest 1)
                               \
                                -> Reduce 5 (dest 2)
{code} 

As you can see, the Reduce 5 comes before Union 3 and misses all the results from Map 6.

cc'ing [~jpullokkaran] and [~hagleitn], The previous code is not aligned as it should. Here is the dependency
{code}
Stage: Stage-2
    Tez
      Edges:
        Map 6 <- Union 3 (CONTAINS)
        Reducer 2 <- Map 1 (SIMPLE_EDGE), Union 3 (CONTAINS)
        Reducer 4 <- Union 3 (SIMPLE_EDGE)
        Reducer 5 <- Reducer 2 (SIMPLE_EDGE)
{code}, a quick try to fix it.,
