ATTACHMENT ID: 12851635 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build, @jcamachor most of the change of this PR is re-writing the implementation from `long` to `DateTime`, i might be missing something but not sure what is exactly fixing. It will be nice if you layout a test scenario that breaks the old code and get fixed by this patch.  , [~bslim], you are correct, I thought deserializing was having an issue with timestamp values (got confused with default timezone), but it does not. I am closing this one as invalid., Reopening and updating description., PR is in https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/145 ., [~jcamachorodriguez] thanks LGTM.
More questions, can you ensure that if the user uses UDFs like to_utc_timestamp(timestamp, string timezone) this still work ?  , [~bslim], that's a fair point.

That logic is independent from this code and somehow more related to the change in HIVE-15863.

This problem should not exist since Calcite cannot fold {{to_utc_timestamp(timestamp, string timezone)}} (the UDF is a black box). In turn, it relies on the Hive expression folding logic, which needs to go through the Calcite to Hive expression translation, and thus, will have the right literal in timestamp (for more details, check the changes in ExprNodeConverter.java in HIVE-15863)., +1,
