[Checked trunk, there's a UDF 'last_day' already supported., HIVE-9358 created last_day and HIVE-9357 created add_months in trunk., This work is split to separate JIRA(s) for tracking. SEE ALSO 'relates to' links., hive trunk already has:
- LAST_DAY(d)
- NEXT_DAY(d, name)
- ADD_MONTHS (date, integer)

to get FIRST_DAY:
{code}
concat(substr(date,1,7), '-01')
{code}
, REPLACE exists in hive already:
{code}
select regexp_replace('JACK and JUE','J','BL');
OK
BLACK and BLUE
{code}, TRANSLATE also exists in hive
{code}
select TRANSLATE('SQL*Plus User\'s Guide', ' */\'', '____');
OK
SQL_Plus_User_s_Guide

select regexp_replace('SQL*Plus User\'s Guide','[ \\*\/\']','_');
OK
SQL_Plus_User_s_Guide
{code}, instead of CHR you can use unicode codes
{code}
select '\u0072\u0101\u0108\u0108\u0111';
