[Have you tried this by starting pig shell with "pig -useHCatalog" ? If I used "-useHCatalog", then I don't have to load the hive jars., This issue has been resolved in Hive-1.2.0., I tried the same queries in Hive 1.2.0, it could work well. 
Close it as fixed, Closing jiras fixed in 1.2.0 release . 
Please open new jira if you find any related issue.
