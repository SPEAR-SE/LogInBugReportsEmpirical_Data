[[~mmccline], [~prasanth_j], could one of you take a look a this please?, The query that is failing is "update acidTbl set b = 5 where a = 3"
The issue is that "hive.io.file.readcolumn.names" has value "a"
but in 
{noformat}
getSargColumnNames(String[] originalColumnNames,
      List<OrcProto.Type> types, boolean[] includedColumns, boolean isOriginal){noformat}

{noformat}
for(int columnId: types.get(rootColumn).getSubtypesList()) { 
{noformat}

has 2 elements in the list ('a', b') so {noformat}originalColumnNames[i++]{noformat} gets ArrayIndexOutOfBounds

The reason this is not an issue in Acid 1.0, is that {noformat}if ((deltas == null || deltas.isEmpty()) && context.sarg != null) {{noformat}
 in callInternal() is false and this code path never happens.

ATTACHMENT ID: 12826533 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build, Test failures are unrelated., Mostly looks good to me. Can you please add a test for this? Any reason to remove one of the test?

, Eugene instructed me to remove the @Override method that was disabling the tests that were blowing up.  When removed, the problem occurred so I could debugged and verify the fix.  So, it has a test and is ready.  He has created a whole new paradigm., I see. Thanks for the clarification. , +1, actually both testOrcPPD() and testOrcNoPPD() in TestTxnCommands2WithSplitUpdate need to be removed, Ok, created patch #2 with testOrcNoPPD() removed., did you want to attach it?, I should release the parking brake?  ok,
