[The database upgrade sequence may have some issue...  I hit the same issue.  However, it's successful when I run the upgrade script (011-HIVE-3649.derby.sql) to upgrade the same column., I don't think this is a bug. The error will pop up if you either don't upgrade your schema, or attempt to use a 0.10 client against a 0.9 db schema. I think we should just mark this closed., Agreed with Harsh J, it looks like the upgrade script was not run. Closing., Can you kindly tell me if automatic upgrade is supported?    It's true that I pointed Hive 11 to a Hive 9 Derby metastore database.  However, based on the error we (originator of the defect and myself) are seeing, it seems some sort of automatic upgrade is being done, but not well.  Closing this Jira is fair if auto-upgrade is not supported...

Thanks..., AFAIK auto upgrade is not supported. We specifically publish SQL scripts for this reason. Also a derby metastore is a bad idea in any environment other than development.]
