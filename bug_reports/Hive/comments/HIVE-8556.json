ATTACHMENT ID: 12676467 - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build, test failures are unrelated, [~prasanth_j] [~mmokhtar] this is a related patch btw, Looks good to me
[~prasanth_j] ?, +1, [~hagleitn] needed for 14?, I'm hesitant to get this into .14. It's a good change for sure, but a bit of code and not really "fixing" anything. Thoughts [~gopalv] or [~prasanth_j]?, committed to trunk]
