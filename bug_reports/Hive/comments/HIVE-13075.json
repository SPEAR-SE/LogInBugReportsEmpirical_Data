[[~wikp] Thanks for reporting this and the diagnosis!
I should have checked for this first. Lets track it in the new jira with the patch. 
, I've put patch in the review board first because I understand "How to contribute" section of the documentation that patch should be reviewed first. , Please note that it is customary to also put the link to reviewboard in the jira., Thank you, I'll remember that. 

My comment was about need of small improvements in "How to contribute" document. For non-english speakers, like me, a to-do list from "I've got some code" to "see my code after git pull on master" would be invaluable ;)
, [~wikp], if you would like to improve "How to Contribute" just obtain wiki edit privileges as described here:

* [How to get permission to edit | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/AboutThisWiki#AboutThisWiki-Howtogetpermissiontoedit]

* [How to Contribute | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute]
** [Creating a Patch | https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HowToContribute#HowToContribute-CreatingaPatch]

Or you could open a new JIRA issue with your doc improvement ideas, and we'll try to find time to do it for you.]
