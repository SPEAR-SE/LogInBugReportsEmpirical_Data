The old approach is to create a new object for every single writable element; with this patch, it only creates new a new object when there is type change.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tongjie","name":"tongjie","key":"tongjie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tongjie Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-04-10T19:05:16.592+0000","updated":"2014-04-10T19:05:16.592+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12704408/comment/13966341","id":"13966341","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcoffey","name":"jcoffey","key":"jcoffey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Coffey","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"You've cited a \"lazy\" serde.
