In fact, these filters have no effect. \n\nThe only working solution I know of is to use nested SELECTS that apply the partition filters, then join on the results.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"278404","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"wiki documentation for partition filtering and outer joins doesn't match behavior","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deanwampler","name":"deanwampler","key":"deanwampler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dean Wampler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deanwampler","name":"deanwampler","key":"deanwampler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dean Wampler","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-3929/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1c1ov:"}}
