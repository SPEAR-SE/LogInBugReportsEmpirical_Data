Hiveserver2 docs ([https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients], JDBC client sample code) explain in a quick comment that local now means local to the server. I think this is just a rationalization for a bug. When a user types \"local\" \n\n# it needs to be local to him, not some server \n# Failing 1., one needs to have a way to determine what local means and create a \"local\" item under the new definition. \n\nWith the thirftserver, I have a host to connect to, but I don't have any way to create a file local to that host, at least in spark. It may not be desirable to create user directories on the thriftserver host or running file transfer services like scp. Moreover, it appears that this syntax is unique to Hive but its origin can be traced to  LOAD DATA LOCAL INFILE in Oracle and was adopted by mysql. In the latter docs we can read \"If LOCAL is specified, the file is read by the client program on the client host and sent to the server. The file can be given as a full path name to specify its exact location. If given as a relative path name, the name is interpreted relative to the directory in which the client program was started\". This is not to say that the hive team is bound to what Oracle and Mysql do, but to support the idea that the meaning of LOCAL is settled. For instance, the Impala documentation says: \"Currently, the Impala LOAD DATA statement only imports files from HDFS, not from the local filesystem. It does not support the LOCAL keyword of the Hive LOAD DATA statement.\" I think this is a better solution, if true client locality can not be implemented. The way things are in thriftserver, I developed a client under the assumption that I could use LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH and all tests where passing in standalone mode, only to find with the first distributed test that it did not generalize beyond that.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"\"LOCAL\" in LOAD DATA LOCAL INPATH means \"remote\"","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=piccolbo","name":"piccolbo","key":"piccolbo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Antonio Piccolboni","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=piccolbo","name":"piccolbo","key":"piccolbo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Antonio Piccolboni","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-11949/votes","votes":2,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2lj8v:"}}
