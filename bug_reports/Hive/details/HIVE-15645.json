First session gets config and property correct, but something (I am pretty sure it's the unset in open path) resets the config. Then the 2nd session (after expiration) gets the property correct but the config is not set, so it logs as if it is going to correct queue but goes to a wrong (default) queue, which is what we have observed for a specific session in the cluster. The field is also reset to null from conf (in a place where I added the warn log), after the log statement about the queue. The 3rd session (after the 2nd expiration) logs null queue (because the field is also null now), and goes to the wrong queue, as does every one after that. So, for pool sessions we set the session into conf every time now. I also added a warn log for the future, and a null check cause we never expect null queue for pool sessions. To fix this properly the separation of pool and non-pool sessions that was started at some point needs to be completed, but that's a major refactoring, not a bugfix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-01-17T19:10:09.167+0000","updated":"2017-01-17T19:11:00.689+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13035370/comment/15826692","id":"15826692","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This still might be one step forward two steps back.
