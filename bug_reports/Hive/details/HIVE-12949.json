If you see, LogDivertAppender has a Filter which decides which server side message to be logged at the session based on the logging level. The logic is here : https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/service/src/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/operation/LogDivertAppender.java#L150.\nAs for the operation log, it depends on the parentSession's HiveConf which decides the logging level as initiated here : https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/service/src/java/org/apache/hive/service/cli/operation/Operation.java#L246\nEverytime you modify the parameter from the session, the HiveConf object corresponding to the session gets modified to reflect the parameter change and hence the operation is initialized with this information.\n\nI tested this parameter with the current master and the feature works as intended, if you feel that this is not the case, please update the jira/title to include the actual issue with a testcase. I don't think a description change of hive.server2.logging.operation.level is the correct way to fix this problem if this is an actual bug.\n\nThanks\nHari","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-02-06T06:20:45.438+0000","updated":"2016-02-06T06:20:45.438+0000"}],"maxResults":6,"total":6,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-12949/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2s2c7:"}}
