The class is used once without calling init and once being properly init'd. The reason is that some other code needs to use the \"group splits\" method. Since you've moved init to the constr now, this has gotten even uglier. Could you move the split grouper methods to a separate util class (static) and leave the pruner to just prune.\n\nAlso - I think you've moved the initialization of the dynamic pruner to the constr of the input initializer, in order to not miss any events. Can you add a comment to the code explaining this?\n\nVery cool to see a real unit test  :-) thanks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-25T18:20:52.654+0000","updated":"2015-03-25T18:20:52.654+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12782225/comment/14380426","id":"14380426","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"i see you've fixed calling close consistently on the data input stream. maybe use try{}finally there?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-25T18:27:23.463+0000","updated":"2015-03-25T18:27:23.463+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12782225/comment/14380438","id":"14380438","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"it seems you're setting numexpectedevents to 0 first and then turn around and call decrement.
