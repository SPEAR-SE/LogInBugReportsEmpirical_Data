I'm using Apache Beam's HCatalogIO to store data in Hive. As part of HCatOutputFormatWriter#commit(), partitions are registered in FileOutputCommitterContainer#registerPartitions(). Here, it checks for the existence of the partitions, and, if so needed, creates them. For parallel processes, this fails a lot of the time, because, as far as I understand, another process creates the partition in the meantime. This causes an AlreadyExistsException to be created for the partition, which bubbles up to the API consumer.\r\n\r\nRelevant logic: [https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/release-1.2.1/hcatalog/core/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/hcatalog/mapreduce/FileOutputCommitterContainer.java#L898-L920]. Logic is also present on master.\r\n\r\nAm I missing something, and if not, is it an acceptable solution to swallow the AlreadyExistsException when adding the partitions?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race condition when ensuring a partition exists often causes AlreadyExistsException for the partition","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rjkip","name":"rjkip","key":"rjkip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Reinier Kip","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rjkip","name":"rjkip","key":"rjkip","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Reinier Kip","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-18931/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3r6jj:"}}
