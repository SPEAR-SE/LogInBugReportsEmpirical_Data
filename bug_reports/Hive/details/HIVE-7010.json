I don't think that asking you to revert it will help that in general but getting some sense of how the APIs evolve will inform how we should track those changes. It seems that that we will need to support component versioning rather than API versioning. If this is how APIs evolve across the other components as well then the version indicator in the URL doesn't seem very meaningful to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-05-05T18:55:07.878+0000","updated":"2014-05-05T18:55:07.878+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12712040/comment/13989867","id":"13989867","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think one possibility is that whenever any backward incompatible change is made, to bump the version and make sure all the currently supported endpoints are available there.
