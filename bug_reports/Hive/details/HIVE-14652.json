The main question is, why do we evaluate UDFs on partition values from the pruned set for the filters that we purport to remove, if we have just used the same filters to prune the partitions, so one of the two should be true - either we cannot eliminate the filter, or the final result of all the expressions is known to be true (or not matter). So we'd insta-bail as soon as we'd see any disagreement after evaluation; or have a walk state that indicates the value doesn't matter.\nI don't really know if that's the case or if I'm missing something here. \n\nSo for now the fix is to change the new IN logic introduced by HIVE-11424 to follow the same twisted logic. \nLet's see what that breaks.\n\nThe problem is that HIVE-11424 changes IN to true if there's a column on the left side, but, as described above, this IN was used to filter the partitions, so in the NOT IN case, IN is guaranteed to be false. So, while the \"regular\" logic would have confirmed that and then applied NOT to the false constant, the current code  results in NOT being applied to the true constant.\n\ncc [~jcamachorodriguez] [~ashutoshc]\n\nEDIT: I think the old IN logic for UDF on the left hand side might also be broken the same way, need to take a look","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-26T03:00:18.363+0000","updated":"2016-08-26T03:02:19.112+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13000247/comment/15438552","id":"15438552","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for looking into this [~sershe].\n\nThe problem seemed to be there for IN clauses before HIVE-11424 went in, which just added the case for single column. In fact, as you said, it is expected that logic for multi-column (struct) IN clause is broken too.\n\nI think the source of the problem is in the assumption for the IN logic about the WalkState, as it considers that TRUE means that the condition can be removed (comment in line 423 in the original code, line 359 after applying your patch). WalkState seems to be a global overview on the results of the children expressions, thus that assumption is not correct.\n\nI checked the patch and changes look good to me, but I have a couple of questions.\n1. Does the patch still consider the dynamic partition pruner generated synthetic predicates for IN clause with a single column? Previously there was some special handling for this case, but it does not seem to be there anymore. Maybe it is handled generically as any other predicate?\n2. I would extend the patch to cover multi-column IN clauses so we fix all the issues. That would mean extending the logic in lines 359-364 after applying your patch (it seems straightforward), and adding an additional test case.\n\n--\n\nConcerning the logic behind pcr. If I understand your question correctly, the answer is that we need to evaluate them because partition pruning does not necessarily correspond to the filter condition. For instance, consider a table with partition column _b_, and the given predicate _(a = 5 and b = 1) or (a=3 and b=2)_. We can infer that we only need partitions _b=1_ and _b=2_. However, we cannot remove any part of the predicate if both partitions exist. In turn, if only _b=1_ exists, then final predicate would be _a=5_.\n\nBtw, we had some discussion with [~ashutoshc] about moving pcr to the logical optimization phase (Calcite), but till the return path is in place, we cannot complete this task.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-26T06:39:35.009+0000","updated":"2016-08-26T06:39:35.009+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13000247/comment/15440390","id":"15440390","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12825591/HIVE-14652.patch\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 1 test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to 8 failed/errored test(s), 10464 tests executed\n*Failed tests:*\n{noformat}\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.org.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[acid_mapjoin]\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[ctas]\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver[vector_join_part_col_char]\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapCliDriver.testCliDriver[acid_bucket_pruning]\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniTezCliDriver.testCliDriver[explainuser_3]\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.security.TestStorageBasedMetastoreAuthorizationDrops.testDropTable\norg.apache.hive.jdbc.TestJdbcWithMiniHS2.testAddJarConstructorUnCaching\n{noformat}\n\nTest results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/1011/testReport\nConsole output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build/1011/console\nTest logs: http://ec2-204-236-174-241.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build-1011/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.TestCheckPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\nTests exited with: TestsFailedException: 8 tests failed\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12825591 - PreCommit-HIVE-MASTER-Build","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-08-27T01:15:09.501+0000","updated":"2016-08-27T01:15:09.501+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13000247/comment/15440397","id":"15440397","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"No tests fail, surprisingly enough.
