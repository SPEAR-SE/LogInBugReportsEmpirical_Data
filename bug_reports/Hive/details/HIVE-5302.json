Okay, tl;dr: I need to go back to the drawing board on finding a suitable test. Please lower priority or close as appropriate.\n\nLong version:\n\nIn setting up my test case I was too quick to presume AvroSerdeException showing up in the logs was a hard failure. But there does appear to be a non-fatal problem when the partition pruner optimization is working with a non-partitioned avro table. It attempts to make a shadow partition to represent the whole table. Creating this partition relies on an initializer that goes through a code path for instantiating the SerDe based on feedback just from MetaStoreUtils.\n\nSo the AvroSerDe fails during initialization (and logs a WARN about it with an AvroSerdeException), but since this instance of the serde is never actually used, it doesn't result in a failure.\n\nyou can see this by even running the basic sanity test:\n\n{noformat}\n  $> ant clean package\n…\n  $> ant -Dmodule=ql -Dtestcase=TestCliDriver -Dqfile=avro_sanity_test.q test\n…\nBUILD SUCCESSFUL\nTotal time: 1 minute 15 seconds\n  $> less build/ql/tmp/hive.log\n{noformat}\n\nIn the log grep for AvroSerdeException (for me it's line 3198)\n\nSo sad Sean will need to go back to finding a case where this explodes in a way that stops things.\n\nOn the matter of query plan bloat, we could isolate related changes to the Avro Serde so long as there's a way to get at table properties during SerDe initialization. That way it could check partition-specific and then fall back to table on its own. I'll worry about that once I find a test case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=busbey","name":"busbey","key":"busbey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=busbey&avatarId=13233"},"displayName":"Sean Busbey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-09-28T06:01:23.711+0000","updated":"2013-09-28T06:01:23.711+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12668963/comment/13780880","id":"13780880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"We do not necessarily need a documented testable case in the to justify the change, seeing a non fatal error in the logs is reason enough to apply the patch.\n\n{quote}\nIn the matter of query plan bloat, we could isolate related changes to the Avro Serde so long as there's a way to get at table properties during SerDe initialization.
