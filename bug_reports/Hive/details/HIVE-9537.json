The behavior of fixed length is, the padding trailing spaces won't be counted as part of the string. \n\nI do see an issue that if we insert a string with trailing spaces \"abc \" into CHAR(10),  we lost the last space. I think that's an issue since that trailing space is part of the original string.\n\n\nWhat does this mean? \"If both operands are fixed length character strings, concatenation result is a fixed length character string with a length equal to the sum of the lengths of the operands where the length cannot exceed the maximum allowed for a fixed length character string.\" ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aihuaxu","name":"aihuaxu","key":"aihuaxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aihua Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-20T14:26:08.799+0000","updated":"2015-02-20T14:26:08.799+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771533/comment/14328992","id":"14328992","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=the6campbells","name":"the6campbells","key":"the6campbells","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"N Campbell","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I saying that if the current implementation is by design and will not change that it be more completely documented.

Currently for Hive we ignore them for the purposes of comparison, length, and concatenation. As mentioned earlier this is similar to the MySQL/Postgres char semantics (which has often been done when for Hive dev).
