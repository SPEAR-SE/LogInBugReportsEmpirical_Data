This way the retry mechanism kicks in(based on getConnAttemptCount) and will hopefully get a free connection in the next iteration. Without this invocation to dbConn.markPossiblyBroken(), the already broken connection may not be destroyed and BoneCP might wrongly still return the existing broken connection when connPool.getConnection() is called the second time.

Other developers might add retries for other connection pooling types by setting getConnAttemptCount, and easily overlook updating the log message.\n\nEven in case of bonecp exceptions, in some cases the error can be non-recoverable. This is a fatal error and should be rare. The delay due to retries likely to be very small (not easily noticeable to the user). I think that delay would be acceptable for the circumstance.\nThis looks like a tradeoff between more easy to maintain code and a delay that users are unlikely to notice.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-29T18:37:07.773+0000","updated":"2015-09-29T18:37:07.773+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12895309/comment/14935872","id":"14935872","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated the patch; fixed the log, moved the retry logic closer to the code.\nI disagree about extra retries just-in-case - that's what retrying object store and ms client do, and 90% of the cases when I see these (and 100% for the former) is when it blindly retries for some non-recoverable exceptions.\nDBCP has been around for a while and doesn't merit doing things just in case, esp. if there's no way to tell what is recoverable... at least with BONECP we know what we are trying to fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-29T21:13:50.212+0000","updated":"2015-09-29T21:13:50.212+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12895309/comment/14935926","id":"14935926","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the update.
