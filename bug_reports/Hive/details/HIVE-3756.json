Let's walk through an example:\n\nLet's say Parent Dir d1 has permission/group combination A.\nLet's say directory d2 inside Parent Dir has permission/group combination B.\n\nIn the case of non-partitioned tables, d1 will be the database/warehouse dir, and d2 the table dir.\nIn the case of partitioned tables, d1 will be the table directory and d2 the appropriate partition directories.\n\nIf we did not have the flag to inherit permissions on, then whatever data is loaded, be it files inside d2 (as during a load operation) or replacing d2 and everything in it (as during an insert overwrite operation), will have yet another permission/group combination C, which is a function of the user's current umask and the user's default group\n\nThe purpose behind the subdir inherit permissions flag is to make this behaviour go away, and to be able to use the parent dir's permissions/group when possible. So far, so good.\n\nLet's say, for purposes of this entire discussion from now onwards, the flag to inherit permissions is on.\n\nNow, if we load data into d2, without using overwrite, files inside d2 get permission B.\nIf we load data into d2, using overwrite, we now overwrite d2, and thus, d2 takes on d1's permissions, and so do the files inside, thus resulting in d2 and files inside d2 having permissions/group combination A.\n\n--\n\nWhile this behaviour is consistent, I find that from a user's perspective, if they create a table (say unpartitioned), then chmod/chgrp it to B, and then they try to load data into it using an Insert-Overwrite, then they still expect that they're only overwriting data inside the table dir, and their expectation is that the table still have permissions/group-combination B. They don't want it to be replaced by \"A\", the parent db dir's permissions/group , and they don't want \"C\", the umask/current-user-default-group.\n\nNow, as to whether this requires a new flag that overrides \"hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms\" or whether they want \"hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms\" to work in this way is still up for discussion, but there is now need for an additional requirement, that of the following:\n\n\"If the directory being moved in already exists, and will be deleted so that this can be placed, then instead of going with the parent permissions, it should go with the previous dir's permissions.\"\n\nThoughts?\n\nThis can be a separate jira if people feel like it should be, but I think it's also a minor modification of this current jira.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-11T21:34:29.118+0000","updated":"2013-07-11T21:34:29.118+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618191/comment/13711258","id":"13711258","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ctang.ma","name":"ctang.ma","key":"ctang.ma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chaoyu Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Yes, IMO, the table should preserve its own permission/group B in the insert-overwrite case.

If the admin insert overwrite data to this table, it will change the /dbdir/tbldir to 770, breaking the security unexpectedly.\nI can change code to preserve this permission/group of the overwritten table.
