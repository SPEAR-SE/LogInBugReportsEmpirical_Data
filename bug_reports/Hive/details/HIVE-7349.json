 \n    This is a known issue with hcatalog, the maven artifact is compiled against hadoop1 and blocks unit testing. \n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7349\n    @fhueske \n    I found there is no pre-exist test when I begin to work on this issue. How did hcatalog get tested before? If we stick to the vanilla hcatalog, I guess one way is to move it to hadoop1 profile(flink compiled against the maven hcatalog jar can't be used in a hadoop2 env anyway), which will limit its usage to a large extend since almost all hive production servers on run on hadoop2 now.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-28T01:04:39.801+0000","updated":"2015-08-28T01:04:39.801+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725539/comment/14723361","id":"14723361","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Github user jamescao commented on the pull request:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/flink/pull/1079#issuecomment-136359875\n  \n    @chiwanpark \n    Yes, it's sure that the apache version of HCatalog is compiled against hadoop1. Using this jar in an hadoop2 environment will lead to binary incompatibility error. I think Hive community is aware of this problem.\n    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-7349\n    On the other hand. The cloudera Hcatalog jar is compiled against hadoop2, thus works with hadoop2 environment. But using cloudera jar in a hadoop1 environment will lead to binary incompatibility error. I guess one way to solve this is to add a vendor-specific hcatalog-module for users who want to use hcatalog in hadoop2 or we need to wait until hive community publish 2 artifacts in maven for both hadoop1 and hadoop2. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-31T12:35:08.048+0000","updated":"2015-08-31T12:35:08.048+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-7349/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1xha7:"}}
