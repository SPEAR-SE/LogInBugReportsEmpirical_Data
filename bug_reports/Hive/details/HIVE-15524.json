Though the fix in HIVE-10582 does not contain tests, it does look legit. In fact, the problem seems to be in the MapJoinOperator itself. It only happens for LEFT outer join (not with RIGHT outer or FULL outer). Although I am still trying to understand part of the MapJoinOperator code path, the bug could be in the initialization of the operator. It only happens when we have duplicate values in the right part of the output.\n\nHIVE-15493 provided a temporarily fix that removed the code in SemanticAnalyzer that reuses duplicated value expressions from RS to create multiple columns in the join output (this is equivalent to reverting HIVE-10582). \n\nThis follow-up issue should take the code back and tackle the problem in the MapJoinOperator.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Wrong result for LEFT outer join in Tez using MapJoinOperator","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-15524/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i38473:"}}
