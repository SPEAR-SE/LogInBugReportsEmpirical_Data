changes. \nHopefully I haven't oversimplified or relied on other/incorrect assumptions that make the tests pass currently.\n\nI am including the description from the RB here for quick reference:\n\"HIVE-16844 fixed a connection leak issue which subsequently exposed failures in TestHCatClient. The connection leak gets triggered if a metastore instance is updated with a different JDO configuration. TestHCatClient uses 2 metastore instances to test replication related methods. Unfortunately, it does so by providing a different derby db name for the second instance. Since the 2 metastores run in the same JVM, the path fixed in HIVE-16844 gets triggered, resulting in \"sourceMetastore\"'s connection being closed and thus resulting in failures.\n\nIt appears to me that running 2 metastore instances within the same JVM is error prone as there could be unintentional side-effects due to statics in the code (as was exposed by fixing HIVE-16844). This patch provides a way to test the replication related methods without involving a second instance. The changes mainly validate the serialize/deserialize methods. One of the tests, testPartitionRegistrationWithCustomSchema, uses addPartitions method to verify propogation of changes and it appeared that addPartitions wasn't covered by other tests in TestHCatClient and there wasn't a better way to verify the intended path, so I used an approach where the original database and table are dropped and recreated using the serialized-string and captured partition spec.\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sbeeram","name":"sbeeram","key":"sbeeram","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sbeeram&avatarId=30539","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sbeeram&avatarId=30539","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sbeeram&avatarId=30539","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sbeeram&avatarId=30539"},"displayName":"Sunitha Beeram","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-06-21T22:07:59.906+0000","updated":"2017-06-21T22:07:59.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13080080/comment/16058561","id":"16058561","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12873958/HIVE-16908.1.patch\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 1 test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to 8 failed/errored test(s), 10841 tests executed\n*Failed tests:*\n{noformat}\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[tez_smb_main] (batchId=149)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query14] (batchId=232)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query16] (batchId=232)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query23] (batchId=232)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query94] (batchId=232)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.TestReplicationScenariosAcrossInstances.testBootstrapFunctionReplication (batchId=216)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.TestReplicationScenariosAcrossInstances.testCreateFunctionIncrementalReplication (batchId=216)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.TestReplicationScenariosAcrossInstances.testCreateFunctionWithFunctionBinaryJarsOnHDFS (batchId=216)\n{noformat}\n\nTest results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/5722/testReport\nConsole output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/5722/console\nTest logs: http://104.198.109.242/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-Build-5722/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.TestCheckPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\nTests exited with: TestsFailedException: 8 tests failed\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12873958 -
