In the future, we can add more flags for more finer-grained control.\n* Failure by Hive to inherit will not cause operation to fail.  Rule of thumb of when security-prop inheritance will happen is the following:\n** To run chmod, a user must be the owner of the file, or else a super-user.\n** To run chgrp, a user must be the owner of files, or else a super-user.\n** Hence, user that hive runs as (either 'hive' or the logged-in user in case of impersonation), must be super-user or owner of the file whose security properties are going to be changed.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"386427","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Permission inheritance issues","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707839/comment/14007809","id":"14007809","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"body":"Adding some specs here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"created":"2014-05-23T22:40:24.985+0000","updated":"2014-05-23T22:40:24.985+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707839/comment/14207300","id":"14207300","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"body":"I am thinking to create a new wiki child page and add the information of this JIRA directly there, and link from [https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties|https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Configuration+Properties]  \n\n+ [~leftylev] do you have any better thoughts?
