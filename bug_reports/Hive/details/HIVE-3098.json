The heap-dump indicates that hadoop::FileSystem.CACHE had 1000000 instances of FileSystem, whose combined retained-mem consumed the entire heap.\n\nIt boiled down to hadoop::UserGroupInformation::equals() being implemented such that the \"Subject\" member is compared for equality (\"==\"), and not equivalence (\".equals()\"). This causes equivalent UGI instances to compare as unequal, and causes a new FileSystem instance to be created and cached.\n\nThe UGI.equals() is so implemented, incidentally, as a fix for yet another problem (HADOOP-6670); so it is unlikely that that implementation can be modified.\n\nThe solution for this is to check for UGI equivalence in HCatalog (i.e. in the Hive metastore), using an cache for UGI instances in the shims.\n\nI have a patch to fix this. I'll upload it shortly. I just ran an overnight test to confirm that the memory-leak has been arrested.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12537071","id":"12537071","filename":"Hive_3098.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun

Removing that will ensure we cache only one ugi for Kerberos(GSS-API) and delegation token(DIGEST-MD5) auth schemes cutting down on the number of FileSystem objects by half.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohini","name":"rohini","key":"rohini","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohini Palaniswamy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-06-07T16:17:34.878+0000","updated":"2012-06-07T16:17:34.878+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559587/comment/13291234","id":"13291234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Must incorporate Rohini's review comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-06-07T19:24:06.400+0000","updated":"2012-06-07T19:24:06.400+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559587/comment/13291235","id":"13291235","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Removed dependency on UGI::toString().

Closing the FileSystem object immediately and not taking advantage of the cache is a bad thing as the fs init operation is costly. Not closing the filesystem and retaining it in the cache with this fix is not going to cause memory leak unless you have 10000s of users accessing the hivemetastore. Oozie was doing it for sometime before the cache expiry logic was added.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohini","name":"rohini","key":"rohini","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohini Palaniswamy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-06-21T18:31:36.255+0000","updated":"2012-06-21T18:31:36.255+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559587/comment/13398868","id":"13398868","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"If I understand correctly, you essentially intend to only use the cached UGI in a {{doAs}} to get a {{FileSystem}}?

Your solution of closeAllForUGI means you have to keep the original UGI, if you keep recreating them you are back to square one.\n\nThe UGI is basically a wrapper around the javax security context's {{Subject}} which is created by the authentication process.  By design, the UGI/Subject is a context for a specific request/connection -- not for an indeterminate number of future requests.  A UGI should be created when a request comes in and used throughout the request rather than a new UGI created multiple times during the request.  If the request operates in a {{doAs}} block, you don't have to explicitly remember the UGI.  You can simply do a {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI(UserGroupInformation.currentUser()}} when the request is done.\n\nbq. I'd argue that we could achieve UGI immutability if we create a new UGI everytime you add credentials to it by composing the old UGI and the new credentials.\n\nI admire the thought, but it won't work.  If you mean creating a new UGI:\n* Login/relogin is completely broken.  It's not possible to propagate the new UGI to everything holding the old UGI reference in every thread.\n* Code operating in a {{doAs}} block would have to add another nested {{doAs}} to use the tokens/tickets it just acquired.\n* Similarly, code currently expects to create a UGI, perform a {{doAs}} which may update the {{Subject}} with tickets or tokens, exit the {{doAs}} block, then call {{doAs}} on the same UGI and expect the tokens to be in the UGI.\n\nIf you mean swapping out the UGI's subject, it won't work either.  The hash code is based on the {{Subject}}'s identity hash.  Swapping out the {{Subject}} when tokens are added fouls collections using the UGI.\n\nThere might be some interesting things that could be done by moving the fs cache into the {{Subject}}'s credentials.  A finalizer could ensure that all {{Closable}} objects (such as fs instances) in the {{Subject}}'s credentials are closed.  That still requires a UGI to be scoped to a request but could better ensure that everything is cleaned up for the security context.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-06-29T15:29:41.449+0000","updated":"2012-06-29T15:29:41.449+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559587/comment/13411287","id":"13411287","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~rohini] / [~mithun] : After reading through all the comments, my recommendation is to instead of adding more code (and complexity) in Hive to workaround underlying Filesystem issue, lets just disable the fs.cache via config parameter because:\n\n* By disabling cache we are not making anything worse then its today, since we are already unable to reuse FS objects without this patch. \n* Disabling cache will plug the memory leak by not filling FS cache.\n* Once FSContext apis are declared stable for other projects to consume, we can switch over to those where the promise is that underlying problem is fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-11T07:08:39.276+0000","updated":"2012-07-11T07:08:39.276+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559587/comment/13411712","id":"13411712","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Possibly a reasonable approach.
