The query string for many of the concatenate commands in that test include characters which are illegal in XML 1.0, which it looks like Hadoop is trying to produce using the conf when a job is submitted.  This is an open issue in Hadoop https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-7542\n\nThere are a couple ways I can think of so that we could deal with this issue:\n1) sanitize the query String wherever we set it (Driver's execute method and SessionState's setCmd method)  This may have the added benefit of allowing users to execute queries (not just DDL commands) involving such characters.  This could potentially have the issue of escaping characters which were not escaped before and do not need to be depending on how we handle the sanitization process (this would happen for example, if we used the Apache commons library's Java escape method).\n2) sanitize it, or remove it from the job conf in the BlockMergeTask.  The only two places we could run into this issue are in the BlockMergeTask and MapRedTask.  We already running into this issue in MapRedTask, and were only avoiding it in the BlockMergeTask (it appears) by luck, or somebody intentionally using the conf from the Hive object there rather than the one in the BlockMergeTask\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kevinwilfong","name":"kevinwilfong","key":"kevinwilfong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Wilfong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-14T02:52:54.862+0000","updated":"2012-04-14T02:52:54.862+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549144/comment/13261807","id":"13261807","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phabricator%40reviews.facebook.net","name":"phabricator@reviews.facebook.net","key":"phabricator@reviews.facebook.net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Phabricator","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"kevinwilfong has accepted the revision \"HIVE-2918 [jira] Hive Dynamic Partition Insert - move task not considering 'hive.exec.max.dynamic.partitions' from CLI\".\n\n  +1 The escape2.q test issue was fixed by a separate revision, the tests pass.\n\nREVISION DETAIL\n  https://reviews.facebook.net/D2703\n\nBRANCH\n  HIVE-2918-max-dynamic-parts\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=phabricator%40reviews.facebook.net","name":"phabricator@reviews.facebook.net","key":"phabricator@reviews.facebook.net","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Phabricator","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-04-25T17:00:14.727+0000","updated":"2012-04-25T17:00:14.727+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549144/comment/13261808","id":"13261808","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kevinwilfong","name":"kevinwilfong","key":"kevinwilfong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Wilfong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Committed.
