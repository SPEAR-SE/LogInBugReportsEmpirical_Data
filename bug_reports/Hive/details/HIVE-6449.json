The implementation of these interfaces are required for gathering raw data size. Statistics in explain will try to use the raw data size from the metastore. Raw data size should not be dependent on the operating system since its equivalent deserialized row size * number of rows. So I believe that parquet does not implement these interface and hence do not provide raw data size, in which case, file size is shown as the \"Data size:\". If the file size return by metastore or returned by filesystem.getContentSummary() api call is different then the statistics reported will be different. My suspicion is that the file sizes for the table are different for Windows vs Linux. Can you verify if the file size in windows is same as the file size in linux?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasanth_j","name":"prasanth_j","key":"prasanth_j","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasanth Jayachandran","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-18T00:01:14.026+0000","updated":"2014-02-18T00:01:14.026+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12695538/comment/13904009","id":"13904009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rusanu","name":"rusanu","key":"rusanu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791"},"displayName":"Remus Rusanu","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Bucharest"},"body":"[~prasanth_j] thanks for the guidance.
