Driver instances are retained by the Shutdownhook - 35K of them. Looking at the code, I couldn't see any direct leaks - and can only attribute this to failed queries / connections - where the client may have failed to close the connection.\n\nIn the second case, there's two main culprits. DataNucleus PluginManager seems to be retaining a large chunk of the heap. The second is a single FileSystem object which is over 100MB. This is caused by retention of FSStatistics objects - and has been fixed in a Hadoop jira - we should look at adding a workaround for this, i.e. consume the statistics instance as part of the close. The second reason is a large number of entities registered in the deleteOnExit tracker within FileSystem. That, I believe, is something that Hive will need to look at.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-01T00:06:50.307+0000","updated":"2016-03-01T00:06:50.307+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12945215/comment/15231194","id":"15231194","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is targeting 2.0.1 but has no patch.
