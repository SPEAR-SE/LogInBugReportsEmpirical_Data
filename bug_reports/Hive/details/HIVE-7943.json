I thought the reason for separating owner grants from user grants was that the owner grants are dynamically applied at the time of authorization to the current owner (if there would be a way to change the owner). If they are persisted in metadata, the grants need to be changed when the owner changes or when the configuration property changes. (E.g. From ALL to SELECT, DROP etc.)\n\n\"show grant on temp_table\" gives me empty results unless I explicitly do a 'grant all on temp_table to user testuser' .
