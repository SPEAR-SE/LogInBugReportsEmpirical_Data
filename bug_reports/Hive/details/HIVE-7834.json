join than before the join that is with column stats fetch ON or OFF.\nTPC-DS Q55 was a good example for that, the issue is that the current statistics provide us enough information that we can estimate with strong confidence that the joins are one to many and not many to many.\n\nJoining store_sales x item on ss_item_sk = i_item_sk, we know that the NDV, min and max values for both join columns match while the row counts are different this pattern indicates a PK/FK relationship between store_sales and item.\nYet when a filter is applied on item and reduces the number of rows from 462K to 7K we estimate a many to many join between the filtered item and store_sales and as a result the estimate number of rows coming out of the join is off by several orders of magnitude.\n\nAvailable information from the stats\n{code}\nTable\t\tJoin column\tNDV from describe\t\tNDV

thing applies to store_sales and date_dim but with a caveat that the NDV , min and max values don't match where date_dim has a bigger domain and accordingly a higher NDV count.\nFor joining store_sales and item on on ss_item_sk = i_item_sk since both columns have the same NDV, min and max values we can safely conclude that selectivity on item will translate to similar selectivity on store_sales.\nThis is not the case for joining store_sales and date_dim on ss_sold_date_sk = d_date_sk since the domain of d_date_sk is much bigger than that of ss_sold_date_sk, differences in domain need to be taken into account when inferring selectivity onto store_sales.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Use
