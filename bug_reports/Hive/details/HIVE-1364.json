Even ftype could get large for complex nested types, right Ashish?\n\nBut I really think if we're going to do this, we should go to LOB unless I'm wrong about it being possible to do in-place.\n \nSide note:  I recently found out that in InnoDB (at least the version in use at Facebook), the first 512 bytes of each LOB is stored inline in the row, and there's an overall inline row limit of 8K, or something like that.  So a table with a lot of LOB columns can still hit a limit, which is annoying.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-23T19:30:09.627+0000","updated":"2010-07-23T19:30:09.627+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465284/comment/12908592","id":"12908592","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"See HIVE-1632 for an ftype use case.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-09-13T02:44:45.339+0000","updated":"2010-09-13T02:44:45.339+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465284/comment/12909395","id":"12909395","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Just hit a case where TYPE_NAME in the COLUMNS table (limit 128 characters) was waaay too short.
