So if I copy the key as {{HiveKey}}, when spark does the partition, some keys are {{BytesWritable}} (those spilled to disk) and some are {{HiveKey}} (those cached in RowContainer). Then the partition really gets messed up.\nChanging our key type to {{HiveKey}} requires changing {{SparkTran}} which needs much refactor to current code. Even if we can use {{HiveKey}} as key, we may need to add {{write}} and {{readFields}} to {{HiveKey}} in order to keep the extra hash code.

Define the row stored in RowContainer as <byte[], BytesWrtiable> instead of either the current <BytesWritable, BytesWritable> or <HiveKey, BytesWritable>. We get the bytes for HiveKey using kryo. We can do this when we copy the <key, value> pair in HiveBaseFunctionResultList.collect(). That is, we copy the the byte array representing HiveKey rather than copying it as a ByteWritable.\n\nPlease let me know what you think.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-09-05T16:32:13.821+0000","updated":"2014-09-05T16:32:13.821+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12738740/comment/14124268","id":"14124268","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lirui","name":"lirui","key":"lirui","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rui Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks [~brocknoland], [~xuefuz] for the comments.\nI also think using HiveKey is the easiest solution, as long as we don't lose the specific hash code.\n{quote}\nWe get the bytes for HiveKey using kryo.\n{quote}\nWill kryo serialize {{HiveKey.hashCode}} as well?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lirui","name":"lirui","key":"lirui","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rui Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-09-06T02:28:40.376+0000","updated":"2014-09-06T02:28:40.376+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12738740/comment/14124277","id":"14124277","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes.
