You have two columns: decimal(p1, s1) and decimal(p2,s2). We need to statically derive the type for the product of the two columns based on s = s1 + s2 and p1 = p1 + p2 +1. since your s1 = 28 and s2 = 10 in your case, then s = 38.  Similarly, p = 38 (which is the max). Thus, the result column has a type decimal(38, 38). This basically means that the result cannot have any integer part. On the other hand, if the result type is set as (38, 18), I can certainly construct example data which shows that the production of the two column loses the scale that I was expecting.\n\nI understand that NULL may have been surprising to people. However, I wonder why a column defined as decimal (38,28) to be used to store data like 1.2, 1.44, etc. Is it reasonable to have a smaller precision/scale?\n\nThis sounds like a data modeling issue. the metadata needs to closely define the data.\n\nIt's a good point that an ERROR here might be better so that NULL doesn't slick in unnoticed. I believe that in MySQL there is a strict mode, which, when on, will generate error in this case. We don't have such mode defined in Hive, but it may make sense to introduce such a mode.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-09-01T00:06:38.171+0000","updated":"2016-09-01T00:06:38.171+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12998087/comment/15454201","id":"15454201","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gurmukhd","name":"gurmukhd","key":"gurmukhd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10438","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10438","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10438","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10438"},"displayName":"gurmukh singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Thanks Xuefu Zhang ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gurmukhd","name":"gurmukhd","key":"gurmukhd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10438","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10438","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10438","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10438"},"displayName":"gurmukh singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2016-09-01T03:46:02.540+0000","updated":"2016-09-01T03:46:02.540+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12998087/comment/15503847","id":"15503847","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=akhilnaidu","name":"akhilnaidu","key":"akhilnaidu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Akhil Chalamalasetty","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Thank you for the elaborate explanation Zhang.
