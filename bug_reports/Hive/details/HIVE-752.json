As feature sets grow it becomes impossible to do this without a full time QA staff. So, for now, we need at least continuous smoke testing of all features, including HWI imho. When a release candidate is rolled it's time for the significant manual testing - asking for that on every commit is pretty difficult.\n\nbq.

I think in the original ticket I suggested that we get separate build running on Hudson that tests all of the unit tests against all of the supported Hadoop versions - I'm not sure who's in charge of the Hive Hudson, but if Cloudera can help get that set up we'd be happy to.\n\nbq.

In the meantime, it would be great if you could write up a \"manual test plan\" for HWI. Its existence isn't even mentioned in README.txt, so it's difficult for new contributors to figure out what functionality they need to manually verify.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-08-29T00:14:48.712+0000","updated":"2009-08-29T00:14:48.712+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432924/comment/12749064","id":"12749064","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Added a jetty Test Case\nTweek to build.xml for jetty test.\nFixed 20 shim to set war and context path.\n\nStill need to test 18 and 19","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-08-29T03:44:21.321+0000","updated":"2009-08-29T03:44:21.321+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432924/comment/12749223","id":"12749223","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Added Test case, tested with 17 18 20","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-08-30T03:33:38.609+0000","updated":"2009-08-30T03:33:38.609+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432924/comment/12750192","id":"12750192","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Committed in both trunk and 0.4 -
