I believe the original HIVE-3431 patch was created to addresss HiveServer/HiveServer2 issue where the you could have multiple sessions with same user (eg when its not impersonating). In such case all the queries will be sharing the same resource directories resulting into conflicts.\nThe proposed patch restores the pre - HIVE-3431 behavior. The CLI users can continue to include user.name macro, there's already hive.session.id which can also be include if needed. For example,\n{noformat}\n<name>hive.downloaded.resources.dir</name>\n<value>/tmp/resource_dir/${user.name}/${hive.session.id}</value>\n{noformat}\n\nBesides restoring the old behavior, the patch also enabled the hiveserver2 session handle for such isolation. Unlike hive.session.id (which is a timestamp), the hiveserver2 session handle is UUID which is a better option to avoid conflicts. If you are using HiveServe2 without impersonation, then you have an option to include this session handle in the directory path. \nIf you do use the session handles, then it will start creating a new directory per session. Hence there's an option (which is disabled by default) to remove that at the end of session.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadm","name":"prasadm","key":"prasadm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Mujumdar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-05-07T17:23:31.269+0000","updated":"2013-05-07T17:23:31.269+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646178/comment/13651300","id":"13651300","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, I see what you did now. *smile*\n\nHow about pushing the change into cli to set a uuid as hive.session.id and changing the default value of hive.downloaded.resource.dir to use it also.
