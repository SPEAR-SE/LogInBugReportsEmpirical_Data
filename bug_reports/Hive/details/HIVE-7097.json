Harish and I debated about this change so you can put all the blame on me.\n\nWe decided to go this path because:\n1. We had a user who was trying to import about 50,000 tables from existing databases that contained all kinds of strange characters in column names.\n2. The new behavior is consistent with SQL standards\n3. Most Hive users did not know about the regex feature and did not use it.\n4. Other databases allow .* as part of the column name.\n\nIt's worthwhile for others to give their opinion on this. Personally I think the breaking change is better in the long run. Can you give more detail about why you favor the old path? Is it because of Shark compatibility?
