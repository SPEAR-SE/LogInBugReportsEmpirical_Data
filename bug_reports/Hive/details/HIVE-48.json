Michi, pls confirm.\n\n1. implement a thrift client/server for hive. for now, the interface consists only of execute and fetch_row. we were able to setup the framework with a thrift server and a java client which talks to the server. next step is to get the server to run the queries. \nnotes: we looked at the metastore code and thought it might be simpler to first implement a separate thrift client/server before merging it with the metastore. some installations might want to have separate instances of metastore and hive server. and, its easier to test a smaller interface where we understand the code. also, metastore code seems to have classes which arent being used at all and the scripts to start/stop metastore dont really work in non-facebook installations (need to file separate jiras for those).\n\n2. build a jdbc interface which makes calls to the generated java thrift client. we could also have python and perl dbi interfaces which can be make calls to the generated thrift client code in those languages. so, the thrift interface is a generic interface which is not specific to any particular standard (jdbc/dbi etc).\n\n3. the directory structure in the code would be as follows in src/contrib/hive. it follows a similar model to metastore.\n\nservice/if/hive_service.thrift\nservice/include/<headers from thrift>\nservice/fb303/<scripts for service_ctrl to manage server>\nservice/src/gen-javabean/<generated java code>\nservice/src/gen-php/<generated php>\nservice/src/gen-py/<generated python>\nservice/src/gen-perl/<generated perl>\nservice/src/scripts/<ctrl scripts for server>\nservice/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/service/HiveServer.java\nservice/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/service/HiveClient.java\njdbc/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/jdbc/<whatever is in current jdbc patch>\ndbi/<perl dbi interface calling service/src/gen-perl>\ncli/<changed to use HiveClient or HiveJdbc>\n\n4. next steps\na. get server to run queries and return results to client.\nb. move ql/Driver.java to service since the actual running of the query is not really part of the query language.\nc. change cli to use the service\nd. verify which parts of the metastore interface are needed by jdbc and move/copy over parts to hive_service - i dont think it makes sense to do it the other way around i.e. put the hive service into metastore since metastore is not the right abstraction to actually run queries.\ne. there is common thrift code in metastore and service. we should either move it to a seprate thrift directory or make metastore use stuff from service.\n\nIt will be good to meet up to discuss them in more detail. I'll let Michi provide a patch for the hive server/client and jdbc wrappers for the hive client.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-11-03T22:20:23.638+0000","updated":"2008-11-03T22:20:23.638+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403853/comment/12644835","id":"12644835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadc","name":"prasadc","key":"prasadc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Chakka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Regarding unused files in metastore, these are the files that got carried over hive prototype which used file based metastore. We left them there in case some one wants to use file based metastore. So in a sense they are useful and there are tests.\n\nI think we should combine the servers now. It will be difficult and time consuming to merge them later. Advanced users can still have two installations of the same server but direct metadata calls to one server and data calls to another server. But the default case, there will be only one server and easier for maintenance.\n\nOnly issue I see is that metastore code is independent of ql/cli code. So it might be better to build JDBC server on top of metastore server (ie extend metastore server) and import metastore thrift IDL into service thrift IDL. So the JDBC service would be a superset of metastore functionality.\n\nWhat do you guys think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadc","name":"prasadc","key":"prasadc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Chakka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-03T22:31:28.352+0000","updated":"2008-11-03T22:31:28.352+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403853/comment/12644837","id":"12644837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=michim","name":"michim","key":"michim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michi Mutsuzaki","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ragho: I confirm.\n\n- I should be able to finish implementing HiveServer.java/HiveClient.java by the end of this week (maybe by Sunday).

What is the motivation for Driver.java:87 change?\n\nThe reason was that there is currently no way to retrieve the result table name in the server. Also, the driver is always returning the result of queries, so, 'result' seems to be a reasonable name for the table. Ideally, we should have a function which converts a schema DDL to a Schema object and we should be able to query the schema object. Right now we just pass the schema string as is to the DynamicSerDe.\n\n> 2. In JdbcSessionState.java what are execString and fileName variables used for?\n\nRight now JdbcSessionState is a dummy class. Its not being used for anything. The plan is to use it later on. I just copied over the class from Cli. I can make it an empty class. \n\n> 3. Shouldn't HiveResultSetMetadata.java be doing something?\n\nThe plan was to stage the JDBC implementation. There are a bunch of auto-generated classes which will be used later on.\n\n> 4. In HiveResultSet.java:436 the getDouble function is missing TODO comment? Same is true for getFloat and getInt.\n\nThe TODO comment is inside the function body. Isnt that enough?\n\n> 5. For the non implemented functions should we throw a non implemented run time exception instead of just returning 0. \n\nreturn 0 was auto-generated. I'll change them to throw SQLException instead.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-01-05T18:55:22.377+0000","updated":"2009-01-05T18:55:22.377+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403853/comment/12660941","id":"12660941","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Two changes:\n1. made JdbcSessionState a dummy class\n2. now throwing SQLException for unimplemented functions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-01-05T21:45:45.394+0000","updated":"2009-01-05T21:45:45.394+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403853/comment/12660983","id":"12660983","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1.\n\nLooks good to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-01-05T23:15:52.613+0000","updated":"2009-01-05T23:15:52.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403853/comment/12661019","id":"12661019","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dhruba","name":"dhruba","key":"dhruba","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=dhruba&avatarId=30636"},"displayName":"dhruba borthakur","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I get compilation problems:\n\ncore-compile:\n    [javac] Compiling 10 source files to /mnt/vol/devrs004.snc1/dhruba/commithive/build/jdbc/classes\n    [javac] /mnt/vol/devrs004.snc1/dhruba/commithive/jdbc/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/jdbc/HiveConnection.java:452: unreported exception java.sql.SQLException;
