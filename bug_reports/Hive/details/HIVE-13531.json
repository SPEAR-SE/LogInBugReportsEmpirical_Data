Change the HashCache to a synchronized Map which is easily done with Collections.synchronizedMap\n2. remove the static from the declaration of jsonObjectCache. I not sure why it is static, but if two different queries uses json_tuple they would use the same cache at the moment which would reduce the effective cache size for each query.\n\nAnother thing is the use of INIT_SIZE = 32 and CACHE_SIZE = 16 with a load factor of 0.6f. Wouldn't it make more sense to increase the load factor to nearly one and increase the CACHE_SIZE to 28 or something in that area?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=juergen_thomann","name":"juergen_thomann","key":"juergen_thomann","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"J端rgen Thomann","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-05-18T13:17:18.446+0000","updated":"2016-05-18T13:17:18.446+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12959387/comment/16019597","id":"16019597","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=juergen_thomann","name":"juergen_thomann","key":"juergen_thomann","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"J端rgen Thomann","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"is fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-16060","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=juergen_thomann","name":"juergen_thomann","key":"juergen_thomann","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"J端rgen Thomann","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2017-05-22T13:48:04.091+0000","updated":"2017-05-22T13:48:04.091+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-13531/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2w7sn:"}}
