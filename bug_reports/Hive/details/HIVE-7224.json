Looking at https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/HiveServer2+Clients#HiveServer2Clients-BeelineCommandOptions the following explanation of the {{--incremental}} property suggests that this is expected:\n\n{quote}\nDefaults to false. When set to false, the entire result set is fetched and buffered before being displayed, yielding optimal display column sizing. When set to true, result rows are displayed immediately as they are fetched, yielding lower latency and memory usage at the price of extra display column padding. Setting --incremental=true is recommended if you encounter an OutOfMemory on the client side (due to the fetched result set size being large).\n{quote}\n\nSo it seems there is a tradeoff when using {{--incremental}} that the column padding won't be optimal, but memory usage will be better. This makes sense since the {{IncrementalRows}} class that controls this logic doesn't do any buffering of rows, so it cannot predict what the optimal column width should be since it only looks at one row at a time.\n\nI think a better approach for the {{IncrementalRows}} class would be to instead buffer 1000 rows at a time (by default, this value can be configurable), this way it can optimally set the column width for each set of 1000 rows. This shouldn't introduce memory issues unless each row is huge, in which case the use can decrease the buffer size to say 100 or 10.\n\nWhat do you think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-05T18:51:18.912+0000","updated":"2016-07-05T18:51:18.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12720910/comment/15363091","id":"15363091","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgumashta","name":"vgumashta","key":"vgumashta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vaibhav Gumashta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~stakiar] I agree that buffering would improve usability.

This would mean some rows have the separator \"|\" out of alignment with previous row. However, even if we recompute every 1000 rows, we could still  have misalignment every 1000 rows.\n\nI looked at where the Row width gets used. The width is getting used only when --outputformat=table (ie TableOutputFormat class) is used .\nIf someone is working on very large outputs, it is likely to be processed by other applications and not human eyes, and a *sv (eg csv) format is likely to be used. It doesn't make any sense waste cpu cycles computing the width in those cases. This is also the case where performance impact of this computation would be more visible.\n\nie, If we can selectively enable buffering and width calculation only for TableOutputFormat, I don't think it would matter if we stick to column width based on first 1000 rows or recompute every 1000 rows.\nLooks like the Row subclasses have access to beeline options and would be able to determine what the
