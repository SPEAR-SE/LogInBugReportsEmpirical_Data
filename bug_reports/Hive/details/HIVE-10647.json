If you roll into prod you will probably restrict it based on cluster capacity.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-19T01:34:02.746+0000","updated":"2015-06-19T01:34:02.746+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828127/comment/14596975","id":"14596975","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vikram.dixit","name":"vikram.dixit","key":"vikram.dixit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vikram Dixit K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Addressed comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vikram.dixit","name":"vikram.dixit","key":"vikram.dixit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vikram Dixit K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-23T01:30:35.721+0000","updated":"2015-06-23T01:30:35.721+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828127/comment/14602156","id":"14602156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"i think you need the same check for both semaphore acquire as well as release.
