One one hand, that makes sense, since client-side running also launches a metastore, just that it is a local metastore. serverMode makes that clear. On the other hand, there's nothing that stops this from being run from that local metastore. The distinction here is whether it is being called from Hive or HiveMetaStore, and as such, isRunFromMetastore is more accurate here.

It needs a HiveConf. If you prefer, I can do a instanceof check to see if the Configuration I have is actually a HiveConf, and if so, cast and give it directly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-04T20:51:58.090+0000","updated":"2013-10-04T20:51:58.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12671467/comment/13786640","id":"13786640","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"* Your explanation of that variable confuses me further.

There is a class called HiveProxy that tries to common-alize this behaviour, but to instantiate it, we need to know whether we're being instantiated from the Metastore or ql. We could solve this by having two separate classes, and the original intent of SBAP was to work from the metastore, but that is unnecessary duplication.\n\nThe one other change that I could consider from your request is that for client side auth also, we would run through a local metastore, and thus, we could do the authorization from there itself. I would also agree with that approach, although that requires some beefing up first. That, however, would be another redesign if we wanted to pursue that.\n\nAlso, getConf() returns Configuration because the HiveAuthorizationProvider implements Configurable, and we use a hadoop interface in the process. That would be broadening the scope significantly, and if you want to go around changing Configurable to HiveConfigurable all over the place, that should again be a different task to undertake. :)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-05T00:07:36.276+0000","updated":"2013-10-05T00:07:36.276+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12671467/comment/13786820","id":"13786820","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Configuration Vs HiveConf is important though of lesser concern to me.
