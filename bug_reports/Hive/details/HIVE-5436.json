I wanted to see how the intermediate results are handled in case of numericals. For example, for tiny int (1228+1228)/20 will lead to a in-range result, where as the intermediate result 1228+1228 will be a non tiny int.  This scenario will be very common in case of exponential notation.\n2. HIVE-5382 will need a baseline to compare the string cast results with non-string cast results. My plan was to use testcases like this :\nselect cast('-1.5e2' as int)-cast(-1.5e2 as int) from tmp and verify that the result is always 0. This will ensure consistency across cast from string->numericals (and will expose any existing bugs which is fixed in future for only one of the cast types since the non-string cast and string cast are handled separately).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-30T00:31:04.798+0000","updated":"2013-10-30T00:31:04.798+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672244/comment/13809670","id":"13809670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~xuefuz] Please see the comment above and let me know if you have any questions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-30T21:51:29.230+0000","updated":"2013-10-30T21:51:29.230+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672244/comment/13809704","id":"13809704","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~hsubramaniyan] thanks for your explanation. Personally I think for HIVE-5382, current focus might be on making iin-range casting work as expected and letting error handling cases be unified until HIVE-5660. Per interdeciate result, Hive evaluates on an expression tree. In general, the moment a node evaluates to null, the parent operator evaluates to null also.\n\nFeel free to work on HIVE-5660 if you like. I'm just a little bit concerned that the work you done will probably be thrown away because of HIVE-5356. This is why I planned to work on it after HIVE-5356, which I'm current working on.
