In contrast, in Hive there are other operators that are capable of pruning columns e.g. Join operator. Thus, we need to cover those operators in the simplified ColumnPruner or we will end up with operators producing more columns than they need.\n\nAnother problem is that ColumnPruner is the responsible of removing some Select operators if their columns are not read by follow-up operators. We could not remove those Select operators before, as they are introduced by the Hive plan generation or other optimizations.\n\nThus, not sure if we will be able to include this in 2.0.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-13T13:22:11.468+0000","updated":"2015-11-13T13:22:11.468+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12912522/comment/15014703","id":"15014703","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Is it a big perf gain?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-19T23:13:17.147+0000","updated":"2015-11-19T23:13:17.147+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12912522/comment/15015461","id":"15015461","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It does not need to be included in 2.0.0.
