I am trying to access the metastore operations from a Java client using HiveMetastoreClient and using the thrift metastore URI to connect to the metastore service. For the database location and table location, I am using the S3A file system scheme. I am trying to set the access key and secret key for the S3 bucket location in the HiveMetastoreClient, but the client side settings are never honoured and I cannot figure out a way to do this. One way is to provide the per-bucket access key and secret key on the server side in metastore-site.xml. However, I want this to be dynamic as I want the metastore to be multi tenant enabled and based on the current tenant user, I wish to provide these keys through my client. I tried looking through the metastore source code, but did not find a way to do this. Can this be done ?\r\n\r\nThank you,\r\n\r\nSandhya\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Cannot set fs.s3a.access.key and fs.s3a.secret.key from HiveMetastoreClient","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanu","name":"sanu","key":"sanu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34050","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34050","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34050","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34050"},"displayName":"Sandhya Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sanu","name":"sanu","key":"sanu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34050","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34050","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34050","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34050"},"displayName":"Sandhya Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":"2018-07-11","customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-20133/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3vpzb:"}}
