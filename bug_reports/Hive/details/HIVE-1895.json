This\ninterface needs to be extended so that it is possible to route all MetaStore\ninteraction with the warehouse file system through an implementation of this\ninterface.\n\n{quote}\nThe other problem I see is that the MetaStoreFS interface that this patch added is incomplete -\nit only defines a deleteDir() method. What about createDir(), isDir(), etc? It seems like any MetaStore\ncode that directly references Hadoop's FileSystem class needs to get moved into HiveMetaStoreFsImpl.\n\nI don't think this needs to be done right away, but the problem with waiting is that any changes to MetaStoreFS\nwill break classes that implement older versions of that interface. Since MetaStoreFS is a public API we\nneed to get this done before it appears in an official release.\n{quote}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"123485","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Finish implementing MetaStore file system abstraction layer (MetaStoreFS and HiveMetaStoreFSImpl)","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-1895/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0lhhz:"}}
