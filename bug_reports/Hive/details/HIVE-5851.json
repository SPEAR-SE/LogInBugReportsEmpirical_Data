Is there any means by which i can reduce this lag time for the launch of map-reduce job.  this is one of the log messages that is being logged during this lag time  13/11/19 07:11:06 INFO mapred.FileInputFormat: Total input paths to process : 1 13/11/19 07:11:06 WARN httpclient.RestS3Service: Response '/Analyze%2F2013%2F10%2F03%2F465' -
