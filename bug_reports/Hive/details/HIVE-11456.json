On the face of it, \n# In the first place, I'm not sure this'd be a problem, since Pig assumes \"insert-overwrite\" semantics, as opposed to \"insert into\". But then again, this is dynamic-partitioning, so it's not like Pig could check the output directory, _a priori_.\n# Pig 0.14 uses prefixes (vertex_id + edge_id) to make sure the file is unique. I don't foresee that the suffix might mess with it.\n\nPermit me to ruminate on this.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-05T21:28:22.874+0000","updated":"2015-08-05T21:28:22.874+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-11456/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2ibp3:"}}
