Check e.g. http://weblogs.java.net/blog/tomwhite/archive/2006/03/a_faster_java_r.html for some background.\n\nThere are essentially two options to avoid this: Alter the expression, or use a different regex library. There may be a way to do the former. \n\nI'll use TestTCTLSeparatedProtocol.test1ApacheLogFormat() as an example.\n\nThis is the pattern generated for this test: (?:^| )((\"|\\[|\\])(?:[^(\"|\\[|\\])]+|(\"|\\[|\\])(\"|\\[|\\]))*(\"|\\[|\\])|[^ ]*)\nNote the sub-expression: ...[^(\"|\\[|\\])]+...\n\nI.e., it builds a pattern for a negating character class (\"[^...]\") that unfortunately doesn't contain a list of characters, but instead another pattern group in parentheses. Namely, the value of QUOTE_CHAR: (\"|\\[|\\])\n\nAfter I manually converted this sub-expression to the legitimate \"[^\"\\[\\]]+\" character class the pattern matcher performed admirably against Johan's test case.\n\nTbh I'm not sure if the character class that currently gets generated is valid; at minimum it may have some unintended side-effects. To implement this properly the pattern builder would need to have access to two different representations of the QUOTE_CHAR parameter (as a grouped expression and as a character class) when there currently only is one. \n\n(You probably need to apply HIVE-520 first to make the TestTCTLSeparatedProtocol unit test run.)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=martind","name":"martind","key":"martind","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Martin Dittus","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-28T18:25:00.332+0000","updated":"2009-05-28T18:25:00.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426452/comment/12734980","id":"12734980","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Fixed as part of HIVE-167.
