What is the reason behind this change? This seems like a regression bug to me.\n\nNormally, we can work around the issue by explicitly setting the table serde to be org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.columnar.ColumnarSerDe. However, this causes a problem for our migration to ORC. Specifically, we have a partitioned table for which we want the new partitions to have locations pointing to ORC partitions, and the old partitions to have locations pointing to RCFILE partitions. Moreover, we need the ability to change the location of a partition to point to RCFILE partition. For this we'd do so by doing SET FILEFORMAT RCFILE. However, b/c of this serde problem the RCFile partition in an ORC table will have the wrong serde, and ALTER TABLE doesn't allow us to set serde for a partition.

I hope Hive release notes would mention breaking changes like this. Otherwise it's very hard to notice these things. For example, we experienced a correctness bug after upgrading to Hive 11 that forced us to revert to Hive 10 until the bug is fixed. And the next time before we upgraded to 12 we spent a month doing upgrade testing, but still we couldn't catch this.
