hand, is not versioned. \nEven if we fix multiple StatsTask issue in Merge, it's perfectly legal in Hive to have to concurrent inserts into an Acid table so you could still end up with stats data for the partition which is not accurate (assuming parallel stats computations simply overwrite each other, rather than corrupt some data structures).\n\nThe later is a general issue with Acid and stats (and may be for MicroManaged tables as well).\n\nPerhaps the right answer is to only compute stats for Acid tables at compactions (or even add another process to trigger stats computation based on number of writes to the partition).  As long as stats are used to guide the CBO, not provide exact answers to queries, they would still be approximately accurate and thus useful.\ncc [~alangates], [~pxiong]\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-11-08T17:59:54.922+0000","updated":"2016-11-08T17:59:54.922+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13014445/comment/15648301","id":"15648301","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This prop causes a new node (stage) to be inserted into the plan that acts like a sync point (CyclicBarrier).
