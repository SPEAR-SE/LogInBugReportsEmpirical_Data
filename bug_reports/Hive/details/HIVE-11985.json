As far as I know, 4000 character limit is only a problem for Oracle, yet the patch seems rejecting any schema that is more than 2000 long. This sounds rather harsh, and a long of times users get around the problem by changing Oracle settings.\n\nOn a high level, I'd echo [~ashutoshc] and [~alangates]'s concerns. If we spend time on this, I'd rather solve the problem in the generic way, regardless the serde type and db type. The obvious inconsistency I see here is that we store for avro the schema if it's less than 2000 while storing a constant string for anything over that. If we determine that it's not necessary to store it for avro, don't store it at all. Or if we can solve the length problem for all serdes, then that's probably the the right way to go.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-09T00:27:59.739+0000","updated":"2015-10-09T00:27:59.739+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901190/comment/14949678","id":"14949678","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~xuefuz] the updated patch takes the route of not storing it at all.\nAlso, it's also problem for other RDBMSes (if it is ever used); Oracle fails, MySQL truncates it silently in my setup, others I haven't tested, probably one of the two.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-09T00:36:40.054+0000","updated":"2015-10-09T00:37:27.989+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901190/comment/14950976","id":"14950976","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~xuefuz] does the updated patch address your concern? :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-09T18:48:51.445+0000","updated":"2015-10-09T18:48:51.445+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901190/comment/14951251","id":"14951251","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm not sure if not storing the types in metastore poses a problem for the following use case: user is able to create an ARVO table without giving an external schema, such as \n{code}\ncreate table j2 (a int) stored as avro;\n{code}\nSee some comments in HIVE-11827.
