The global map does not need to be cleaned up explicitly; you can check the existing cleanup, as far as I can tell this patch wouldn't interfere with it.\n\nOverall, I think we should be able to interrupt the execution with interrupt exception, so I am not sure why some comments say that having a blocking op is a problem - shouldn't an interrupt there abort properly? Abort flag would only be an optimization then. The only problem are other library calls that can swallow interrupt exceptions... as long as abort flag is checked after those it should be alright. Also we should file JIRAs to fix the code if these are Hadoop libraries/components. At the very least they should restore the interrupt flag.
