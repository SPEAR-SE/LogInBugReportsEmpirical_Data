This, however, is not a problem for hive in that the end data is still readable via hive and hcatalog/pig, so we don't get a read error. The read error occurs when external tools that are expecting the file to be snappy-compressed find that it is actually zlib compressed. It can also be a performance/size issue if snappy is desired over zlib, but we still retain zlib. Thus, testing by virtue of readability/non-readability or by way of checking for errors is not possible here.\n\nInstead, to test, end-to-end tests are the way to go here, and I've done the following for this:\n\na) Create table using hive -e, specifying orc.compress=SNAPPY\nb) use pig -useHCatalog, and write to the aforesaid table.\nc) use hive --service orcfiledump on the file inside the table, it will show what compression format it sees. Without this patch, it indicates ZLIB, and with it, it indicates SNAPPY.\n\nIn addition, no other previous tests fail (there are no
