I took a quick look at HIVE-7353 and had a question. Regarding the comment \"the threadpools keep a certain number of threads live and kill excess threads after a configurable keepAliveTime expires ... ideally this is where we'd plug in code to close the JDOPersistanceManager\" -- this applies only to those threads where JDOPersistanceManager#close was not already called, correct ? \n\nIn the remote metastore case, deleteContext() will get executed when the underling transport gets closed for that thread (in WorkerProcess Runnable run() method). \nhttps://github.com/apache/thrift/blob/master/lib/java/src/org/apache/thrift/server/TThreadPoolServer.java#L300\nIn this patch, we call cleanupRawStore inside deleteContext() (which calls JDOPersistanceManager#close)\n(If the client explicitly already called IMetaStoreClient#close on that connection, then the deleteContext() triggered cleanup will be a no-op.) \n\nI haven't looked at ThreadPoolExecutor code, but docs say \"even core threads are initially created and started only when new tasks arrive\", \ni.e. threads won't get pre-created (only to be killed later after keepalive timeout), but will get created when request arrives (which means\nthere will be a transport associated with it, which will trigger deleteContext() upon connection break). IOW, thread goes back to the pool\nonly after the deleteContext is called. And subsequently may get killed after keepalive timeout.\n\nSo, unless someone manually kills the thread, it seems to me that deleteContext() covers the cleanup. (deleteContext() call is in the finally\nblock so that covers errors/exceptions). What do you think ?
