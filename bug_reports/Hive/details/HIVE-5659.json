Unless I'm reading HBaseConfiguration.merge incorrectly, I believe the goal here might have been to go the other way, but that'll give us a usable newConf, whereas we wanted to make modifications to jobConf. Since this is a duplicate of HIVE-6115, and that patch is closer to the required solution, I think, I'm going to shift over to that bug.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-08T23:25:55.960+0000","updated":"2014-01-08T23:25:55.960+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12675926/comment/13866742","id":"13866742","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brocknoland","name":"brocknoland","key":"brocknoland","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brock Noland","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you very much for looking into this!
