THE TRANSFER OPERATION RUNS IN A SEPARATE THREAD. \n\nFrom some of the current usages of this class, I noticed that the calling threads do not wait for the transfer operation to be completed. That is, the calling thread does not join the SteamPrinter threads.\nThe calling thread would move forward thinking that the respective output stream already has the data needed. But, it is not always the right assumption since, it might happen that\nthe StreamPrinter thread did not finish execution by the time it was expected by the calling thread.\n\nFIX:\nTo ensure that calling thread waits for the StreamPrinter threads to complete, StreamPrinter threads are joined to calling thread.\n\nPlease note , without the fix, TestCliDriverMethods#testRun failed sometimes (like 1 in 30 times). This test would not fail with this fix.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12650319","id":"12650319","filename":"HIVE-7228.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pankit","name":"pankit","key":"pankit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pankit
