The issue with using distcp for this is that distcp launches from another job which may be queued on another machine, which does not have access to this file:// uri. Distcp should only ever be used when copying from non-localfilesystems.\n\nAlso, in the spirit of following up HIVE-16686, we missed adding \"-pb\" as a default for invocations of distcp from hive.
