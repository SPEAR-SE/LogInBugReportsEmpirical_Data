We have a similar patch which cleans up session related info when network issues cause client disconnection or clients fail to close sessions. The patch is available for Hive-11 and am porting that to Hive12 and trunk. Unfortunately I didnt create the JIRA earlier. The patch cleanups aggressively as soon as the client disconnects. Based on Carl's feedback from a hive meetup, we would like to have a session timeout after which all idle/disconnected sessions are cleaned. I was working towards that.\n\nHave you started working on this?

I took a quick look at the patch and have some thoughts I want to share. One of our design goals with HiveServer2 was to decouple session state from connection state, the motivation being that Hive queries can take a long time to complete, and you probably don't want your session/query to die if someone trips over your network cable. As a result every RPC contains either a logical session ID, or a logical operation ID. Because of this separation we can do interesting things like multiplex multiple sessions over the same physical connection or reference the same session over multiple physical connections. This property will also make it a lot easier to implement session migration between HiveServer2 instances. It looks like this patch creates a coupling between physical connection state and logical session state, and I think we should try to avoid doing this.\n\nI think we should try to view this issue as two separate problems: 1) making sure that Thrift resources (e.g. threads) are reclaimed when a client disconnects or times out due to inactivity, and 2) reclaiming resources associated with the session (excluding the connection state) when a session times out due to inactivity. Note that a connection timeout and session timeout are not linked, i.e. a connection timeout shouldn't trigger a session timeout and a session timeout shouldn't trigger a connection timeout.
