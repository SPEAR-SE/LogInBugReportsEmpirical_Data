For queries with thousands of mappers, this leads to a stampede to the handful (3?) datanodes that host the schema-file. In the best case, this causes slowdowns.\n\nIt would be preferable to distribute the Avro-schema to all mappers as part of the job-conf. The alternatives aren't exactly appealing:\n# One can't rely solely on the {{column.list.types}} stored in the Hive metastore. (HIVE-14789).\n# {{avro.schema.literal}} might not always be usable, because of the size-limit on table-parameters. The typical size of the Avro-schema file is between 0.5-3MB, in my limited experience. Bumping the max table-parameter size isn't a great solution.\n\nIf the {{avro.schema.file}} were read during query-planning, and made available as part of table-properties (but not serialized into the metastore), the downstream logic will remain largely intact. I have a patch that does this.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12829295","id":"12829295","filename":"HIVE-14792.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun
