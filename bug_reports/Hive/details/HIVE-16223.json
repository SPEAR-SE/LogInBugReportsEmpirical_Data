It will alleviate the above, and also may simplify some pieces of code that try to account for missing bucket files, multiple files, etc.\nThis will require changes to load table logic that is used in ctas, insert, load, import etc.; change in logic when getting buckets, as well as when altering table bucketing (to rename the files).\nUsers will still be able to use old-style bucketing by specifying a non-strict config setting (not on by default).\nThe conversion of existing tables is the biggest issue. Perhaps the existing tables can be \"grandfathered\" into the non-strict bucketing, with some warnings asking the users to convert, and a command to do so in alter table/analyze table.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"deterministic file naming for bucketing in Hive","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13056412/comment/15926851","id":"15926851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"cc [~ekoifman] [~ashutoshc]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-15T19:58:05.305+0000","updated":"2017-03-15T19:58:05.305+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13056412/comment/15926923","id":"15926923","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1.
