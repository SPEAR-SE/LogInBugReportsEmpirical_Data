Are you assuming users will use this in a multi-threaded way?  I think this class is thread safe in as much as users can have per-thread instances, but I don't think the class is re-entrant itself.  I see in other comments you're expecting heartbeating to be done in a separate thread.  Is that the only case you think this will be used?

I see re-throwing so the user can see the error, but don't we still need to mark the batch a failure and abort?

This way we only have the logic in one place.\n** A thought on the produceFault() calls.  Would it be better to create a special RecordWriter implementation that wraps other RecordWriters and throws when you want it to?  That way you don't have to pollute this code with produceFault() calls and you can eventually test errors at more locations.\n* abortImpl()\n** We should look at adding a call to rollback a group of transactions, so that large aborted batches don't cause a storm of metastore calls.

I'm +1 on making this package level, but does it do any good to make the class non-private and leave the constructor private?\nThe class is made package level for testing only.  Private c'tor ensures that it's only constructed via factory methods as originally implemented.\nbq. Why did you make the isClosed value volatile? \nheartbeating is commonly done from separate thread, for example, Storm does it this way.  Also, it's not unusual for  application clean up logic to come from a different thread (for example calling close() as a form of cancel).  So this is volatile to make sure this works properly regardless of how the client is implemented.\nI didn't try any more general thread safety issues in this patch.  Judging by https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/Streaming+Data+Ingest#StreamingDataIngest-Example–Non-secureMode the original intent was to NOT to have multiple threads in a StreamingConnection.  It's worthwhile to do a thread safety review but was not my goal here.  \n\nbq. write()\nI'll refactor this\n\n\n\nbq. SerializationError\nThis is was meant to indicate that a particular row is bad.  For example missing columns, etc.  This gives the client ability to drop this row (or send to dead letter queue) since replaying it won't help.
