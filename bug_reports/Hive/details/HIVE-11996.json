Whcih essentially means that the choice of new line character is static. Why does this come as a a configurable item in the DDL is unclear.\n\nThis limitation seems to be hardcoded here:\nhttps://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/parse/BaseSemanticAnalyzer.java#L171\n\nIMPACT:\n\nWhile storing freform data such as Email or Comments, it is fairly common to have a '\\n' character crop up. A lot of free form ETL on Linux using majority of ETL tools also adds a $ (new line character) to maintain formating. \n\nAs the Hive Language manual shows this as a configurable property, it also leads to misleading solution designs which fail when the create statement is triggered in the development phase.\n\nhaving the ability to choose your row delimiter is a very basic necessacity and it is alarming the this is not supported till Hive 14 to the best of mu knowledge.\n\nSOLUTION:\n\nA possible solution is being worked on over here:\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2254\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Row Delimiter other than '\\n' throws error in Hive.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=netsameer","name":"netsameer","key":"netsameer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sameer Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=netsameer","name":"netsameer","key":"netsameer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sameer Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-11996/votes","votes":4,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2mgfz:"}}
