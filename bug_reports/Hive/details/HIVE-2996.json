Actually, I have the opposite concern, namely that the\nnew hooks and tests are going to make it much harder for Hive\ndevelopers to improve internal, non-public APIs by locking down\ninternal, non-public implementation details. We already have more\nthan a thousand tests designed to catch changes to the public\nAPIs (HQL, the public listener and hook interfaces, the Thrift\nAPIs, etc), and HIVE-2670 is set to add better support for\nrunning these tests in the sort of e2e scenarios that members of\nthe community encounter in production environments.\n\nSince this is such a big change I propose that this work be done\non a separate branch, either here or on github, and then when\nit's finished we can give the committers a chance to evaluate it\nas a whole. How does that sound?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-02T21:25:44.412+0000","updated":"2012-05-02T21:25:44.412+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553578/comment/13266930","id":"13266930","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"@Carl, this will be a iterative process, and the changes are only going in contrib.\nThe internal, non-public APIs are locked for facebook anyway, and we run into these\nproblems at deployment time. It would be very difficult to keep it in sync. in a separate \nbranch.\n\nRight now, there are no tests for these, so any change by any contributor cannot break anything \nin these hooks. As I will be adding tests for these hooks, I will be converting these hooks to \nnot use any private data-structures/APIs. That is the reason, I did not blindly any existing tests.\nIn the last few pushes, we have run into random issues, which could have been addressed before had\nthis test been in place.\n\nAs I said before, the purpose of HIVE-2670 is similar, but having the facebook deployment in the open\nmakes us feel much more comfortable in running the recent branch of hive. I really dont want Facebook \nto have its own branch for hive, which makes it very difficult to sync. up later. The problem is that\nif I keep developing in a separate branch, i will diverge very quickly and be never able to converge.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-05-02T21:36:15.392+0000","updated":"2012-05-02T21:36:15.392+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553578/comment/13267057","id":"13267057","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kevinwilfong","name":"kevinwilfong","key":"kevinwilfong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Wilfong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"@Carl\nCan I commit this patch (our internal environment is severely broken without this fix)?\n\nWe can move the discussion to HIVE-2985","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kevinwilfong","name":"kevinwilfong","key":"kevinwilfong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Wilfong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-03T00:35:03.598+0000","updated":"2012-05-03T00:35:03.598+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12553578/comment/13269402","id":"13269402","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Closing this ticket as invalid since HIVE-2986 was reverted in HIVE-3002.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-07T06:49:40.629+0000","updated":"2012-05-07T06:49:40.629+0000"}],"maxResults":11,"total":11,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-2996/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0lmbr:"}}
