DeadLockCreator - it seems that it can easily guarantee deadlock by calling updateTxns(conn1), updateLocks(conn2), updateLocks(conn1). It could then be enabled permanently.\nI tried that first, but on both mysql and derby it didn't generate a deadlock.  It died with a lock timeout, and took over a minute to do so.

Nit: why are constants in TxnHandler, such as LOCK_ACQUIRED 'protected' They are only used in test code which is the same package as TxnHandler.\nPersonal preference.  \"protected\" says to me that this still belongs to this class.  With package level I'm never sure if I meant to make it package level or just forgot to put a modifier.\n4. This not related to this bug, but MetaStoreThread.BooleanPointer() has multiple threads reading/writing a boolean variable which is not volatile or AtomicBoolean... this looks like a recipe for trouble\nWe can file a separate JIRA for that.  In practice, it's only written in tests and read in production code, so I don't expect to see any issues, but it's best to fix it before someone forgets the original intent and writes to it in
