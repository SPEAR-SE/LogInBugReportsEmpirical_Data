Partitions will be read with their own schema and then coerced into table schema.\r\n\r\nKeeping in mind above, in your example since partition schema is not altered, partition will be read per its old schema which means even if you insert new columns, since partition schema doesn't know about it, new columns will be ignored while reading partition. But since table schema contains it, we will add NULL for it after partition has been read and while coercing it to match table schema. So, current behavior will be considered correct.\r\nOn the other hand if you have altered table schema using {{cascade}} then existing partition schema will also be updated and then partition will be read per this new schema so new column will be read and result set will be as per your second result set with one row with null and other with 3333.\r\n\r\nNow this is how it *suppose* to work but since we have different code paths for self describing file formats like orc vs others like text if you get different behavior in some corner cases that will be considered bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-11-23T17:49:49.496+0000","updated":"2017-11-23T17:49:49.496+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13120405/comment/16264708","id":"16264708","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kgyrtkirk","name":"kgyrtkirk","key":"kgyrtkirk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755"},"displayName":"Zoltan Haindrich","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Budapest"},"body":"Thank you [~ashutoshc] for the clarification, now I understand how this feature works :)\r\nIn this case I think there is no problem with it - so I close this as invalid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kgyrtkirk","name":"kgyrtkirk","key":"kgyrtkirk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kgyrtkirk&avatarId=32755"},"displayName":"Zoltan Haindrich","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Budapest"},"created":"2017-11-23T19:04:53.743+0000","updated":"2017-11-23T19:04:53.743+0000"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-18137/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3n4nj:"}}
