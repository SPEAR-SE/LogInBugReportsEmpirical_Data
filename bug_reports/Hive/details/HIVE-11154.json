However, indexing is not being activated, and my query takes an impractical amount of time to complete. Note that John Pullokkaran at Hortonworks has had a look at the \"explain extended\" log and suggested that I file a bug report.\n \nHere is how I set up indexing:\nSet hive.optimize.index.filter=true;\nDROP INDEX IF EXISTS ipv4indexes ON ipv4geotable;\nCREATE INDEX ipv4indexes \nON TABLE ipv4geotable (StartIp, EndIp)\nAS 'org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.index.compact.CompactIndexHandler'\nWITH DEFERRED REBUILD\nIDXPROPERTIES ('hive.index.compact.binary.search'='true');\nALTER INDEX ipv4indexes ON ipv4geotable REBUILD;\n \nAnd here is my query:\n \nDROP TABLE IF EXISTS ipv4table;\nCREATE TABLE ipv4table AS\nSELECT logon.IP, ipv4.Country\nFROM \n(SELECT * FROM logontable WHERE isIpv4(IP)) logon\nLEFT OUTER JOIN\n(SELECT StartIp, EndIp, Country FROM ipv4geotable) ipv4 ON isIpv4(logon.IP) \nWHERE ipv4.StartIp <= logon.IP AND logon.IP <= ipv4.EndIp;\n \nWhat the query is doing is extracting an IP from logontable and finding in which range it lies within a geolocation table (which is sorted). When a range is found, a country matching the IP range is returned. \n\nI need to set up indexing in order to conduct a binary search rather than going through millions of rows one at a time.
