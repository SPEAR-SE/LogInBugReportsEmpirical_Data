Row counts do not match.\n\nIn details:\nPart A -- original_table\n2013-01-01; 394,755 rows\n2013-01-02; 424,448\n2013-01-03; 427,201\n...\n2013-10-30; 3,234,472\n\nPart B -- copy_of_original_table_new\n2013-01-01; 372,628 rows\n2013-01-02; 400,553\n2013-01-03; 403,495\n...\n2013-10-30; 2,865,877\n\nThe query that is used to populate the original table is the same for populating the \"copy_of_original_table_new\" table. When we rebuilt for 1 day, e.g. 2013-01-01, the number of row counts of the copy_of_original_table_new  matched up exactly with orignal_table.\nWhen we rebuilt for 7 days, the number of row counts matched up exactly.\nWhen we rebuilt for 15 days, the number of row counts matched up exactly.\nWhen we rebuilt for 303 days (10 months), everything fxxked up. No matches.\nWhen we rebuilt for 35 days, 80% matched up exactly. The other 20% are out from hundreds to tens of thousands of rows (a variance of up to 3%)\n\nIn other words, the more days that are specified in the WHERE dt BETWEEN dateStart AND dateEnd, the dates will be out, i.e. no matching row count with original_table.\n\nHowever, of those 20% that are out, we rebuilt each of them statically with the corresponding date. The result is astonishingly surprising -- they matched the original_table row count!\n\nApologize in advance if this is not technical enough, but I hope the message is clear. We believe there is a bug. Not sure how to check our Hive version, but our Hadoop's version is \"Hadoop 2.0.0-cdh4.1.1\"\n\nFor a glimpse of the INSERT OVERWRITE sql, it's here -- http://pastebin.com/g1qxsUm2","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"357688","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"INSERT OVERWRITE DYNAMIC PARTITION on LARGE DATA","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=da789","name":"da789","key":"da789","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072"},"displayName":"Danny Teok","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=da789","name":"da789","key":"da789","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=da789&avatarId=17072"},"displayName":"Danny Teok","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"debian 6.0.7","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-5774/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1pm1j:"}}
