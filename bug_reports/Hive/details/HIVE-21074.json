For example:\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM tbl WHERE bucketed_col = 1 AND (some_compound_expr)\r\n\r\nThen the the value '*1'* should be considered for pruning in the query plan. This limitation has manifested into a simpler case where a table that I am trying to optimized using bucketing technique is not effective when IS NOT NULL is used. Since IS NOT NULL is parsed into NOT(IS_NULL) (a compound expression), the pruning phase is completed skipped causing unnecessary tasks to be spawned. For instance:\r\n\r\nSELECT * FROM tbl WHERE bucketed_col = 1 AND some_other_col IS NOT NULL\r\n\r\nWill not trigger bucket pruning logic and perform a full table
