got it. hadoop is ok - it's already reporting progress whenever any data is consumed or any data is emitted to output collector.\n\nthe issue is that we are not sending data to the output collector - rather we write out data to file system ourselves. the stack trace indicates that we have consumed the entire reduce group and we are writing to the filesystem. that means that hadoop gets no opportunity to report progress (it would have reported progress if we were writing to the output collector).\n\nI am not sure why we haven't seen the problem in our environment yet - perhaps DFS IO is slow in ur environment. the fix is simple (we can report progress either in the filesinkoperator or the joinoperator). i think we should do this in the joinoperator (for the particular case where we have already gone through the entire reduce group) - since that's the only place we are vulnerable right now.\n\ni can post a patch u can try out in a couple of hours ..
