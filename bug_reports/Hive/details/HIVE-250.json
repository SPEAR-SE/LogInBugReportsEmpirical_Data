Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"ok - i guess i was quite off on this.\n\nThese modules use a java object cache - they deserialize objects from underlying dbm files. the object cache (in the way it's implemented) cannot be shared across processes. the act of mmaping the file and then reading it has some performance advantages (less system calls) - but doesn't really help that much from memory perspective. if the file is small and there are lots of readers - then the file system will anyway hold the file in cache (and that's 1X memory consumption).\n\nso for v1 - what i would say is just use one of these modules with efficient deserialization (jdbm uses object serialization by default and that's way too expensive). and trust file caching to do it's job. The object cache in dbm (configurable) will have to be kept to reasonable size - quite likely a subset of the entire data size.\n\nif we get time - we can do something smarter - the object cache should have pointers to data in the underlying mmap'ed file. This would mean that data across all object caches is shared (we will still have to pay for object overhead though). with the same amount of memory - the object cache can be sized much larger (since it's not storing data anymore).\n\n--\ni did do some experiments:\n- replaced file io with mmaped buffers in jdbm - works perfectly\n- bulk of compute cost is in object deserialization. On my T60 with a single thread - lookup throughput went from 6.5K op/s to 41K op/s if deserialization was avoided (by making the object cache large enough to store all values). cpu bound of course.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-01-26T18:55:45.932+0000","updated":"2009-01-26T18:55:45.932+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413202/comment/12702213","id":"12702213","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Committed to trunk.
