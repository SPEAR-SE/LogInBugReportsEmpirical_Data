The problem is that HIVE-1636 modified\n'SHOW TABLES IN <db>' to throw an error when db doesn't exist.\nPreviously in this situation the SHOW TABLES command just returned\nan empty result set.\n\nurl_hook.q points the MetaStore to a new JDO URL and then runs\n'SHOW TABLES'. In the past this caused the metastore to initialize\na new metastore schema, but without creating the 'default' database.\nSince 'SHOW TABLES' wasn't checking for the existence of the\ndefault database the command succeeded with an empty result set.\n\nI think the correct fix for this problem is to make sure that the metastore\ncreates the 'default' table if it does not already exist.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-02-03T21:16:56.174+0000","updated":"2011-02-03T21:16:56.174+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497385/comment/13003320","id":"13003320","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Review request: https://reviews.apache.org/r/469/\n\nThis patch moves the url_hook.q testcase from the contrib/positive directory to the contrib/negative directory. As I noted in my previous comment, this testcase should always have thrown an error, but until recently this fact was masked by another bug in the implementation of SHOW TABLES. That other bug was fixed in HIVE-1636, which consequently caused the error to start popping up in url_hook.\n\nI spent a lot of time trying to resolve the underlying problem (described in HIVE-2029), only to convince myself that this will require substantial changes to the HiveMetaStore class, which I think run the risk of destabilizing the branch. Consequently, I propose backporting this patch to the 0.7 branch in order to resolve the test failure, and then investigate and fix the real problem on trunk in HIVE-2029.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-03-07T10:50:55.514+0000","updated":"2011-03-07T10:50:55.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497385/comment/13003526","id":"13003526","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1.
