The root issue is that the current logic of adding all JARS individually to the CLASSPATH easily breaks on Windows. We have had several people run into this issue and it is a pain point. \n\nCould you tell us how near term is the fix to automatically build the CLASSPATH, as you pointed out that in the near future we are going to stop manually constructing the CLASSPATH?\n\nThis failure is currently specific to unit tests. The limit 12 characters is just a rough estimation because different projects use different numbers of JARS. Tomorrow we could add more JARS to the CLASSPATH as the project grows and even an 11 character enlistment wouldn’t be good enough. Also for custom Hive deployments it is possible that we need to add other JARS to the CLASSPATH (such as SERDEs etc). The patch attached can make the Hive unit tests work well currently. \n\nCould you clarify a little bit more about your proposal? Is using lvy or Maven in the near future going to solve this problem automatically, or you want a more generic solution to this kind of problem (now or after Ivy is used to construct the CLASSPATH)?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xifang","name":"xifang","key":"xifang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273"},"displayName":"Xi Fang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-30T16:59:55.920+0000","updated":"2013-04-30T16:59:55.920+0000"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-4349/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1jocn:"}}
