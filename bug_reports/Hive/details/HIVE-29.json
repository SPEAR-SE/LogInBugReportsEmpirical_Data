Support variables and variable substitution in Hive cli to support things like @@logfile@@ as shown int the example above.\n2. Support the ability to create data flows using data variables such as mentioned in the example above. We also mentioned that it would be cool to support such a syntax natively in a programming language like python, perl etc. and provide client side libraries to compile such chains into optimal hive queries. Note that writing the operations as shown in the example above it another way of composing queries that appeals well to programmers as opposed to nesting in the from clause that appeals well to SQL programmers. There is no reason why these cannot be combined and together, so that the first approach rewrites to nested SQL which is what hive understands. Key thing would be to do this natively as python/perl - other libraries so programmers do not have to learn yet another language...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-01T18:17:27.236+0000","updated":"2008-12-01T18:17:27.236+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408169/comment/12787695","id":"12787695","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Updated link for the SCOPE paper since the one above expired:\n\nhttp://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/jrzhou/pub/scope.pdf\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-08T19:38:55.448+0000","updated":"2009-12-08T19:38:55.448+0000"}],"maxResults":4,"total":4,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-29/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ivd3:"}}
