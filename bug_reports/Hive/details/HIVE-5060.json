implementations of the HiveServer2 API (and I'm talking specifically about Impala here, but others might have a similar concern) should be free to return a pollable {{OperationHandle}} per the

}\n{code}\n\n{{execute(sql)}} discards the {{OperationHandle}} that it gets from the server after determining whether there are results to be fetched.\n\nThis is problematic for us, because Impala

If the idea is not to poll its status, I'm not sure why {{executeStatement}} would return {{TOperationHandle}}.
