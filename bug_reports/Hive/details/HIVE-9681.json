For instance, when the {{StorageBasedAuthProvider}} must authorize an operation on a set of partitions (say from a PreDropPartitionEvent), each partition's data-directory needs to be checked individually. For N partitions, this results in N namenode calls.\n\nI'd like to add {{authorize()}} overloads that accept multiple partitions. This will allow StorageBasedAuthProvider to make batched namenode calls. \n\nP.S. There's 2 further optimizations that are possible:\n\n1. In the ideal case, we'd have a single call in {{org.apache.hadoop.fs.FileSystem}} to check access for an array of Paths, something like:\n{code:title=FileSystem.java|borderStyle=solid}\n@InterfaceAudience.LimitedPrivate({\"HDFS\", \"Hive\"})\n  public void access(Path [] paths, FsAction mode) throws AccessControlException, FileNotFoundException, IOException \n{...}\n{code}\n\n2. We can go one better if we could retrieve partition-locations in DirectSQL and use those for authorization. The EventListener-abstraction behind which the AuthProviders operate make this difficult. I can attempt to solve this using a PartitionSpec and a call-back into the ObjectStore from StorageBasedAuthProvider. I'll save this rigmarole for later.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12699801","id":"12699801","filename":"HIVE-9681.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun
