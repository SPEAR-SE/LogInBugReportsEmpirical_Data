Here's how the above step 4) carries out:\n1. In the HS2 handler thread, when calling {{Driver#compile}}, a {{BaseSemanticAnalyzer}} is initialized. Since the config is changed,\nthe old {{Hive}} instance is replaced with a new one. Let's call the old one *A* and the new one *B*. the {{BaseSemanticAnalyzer}} instance\nis initialized with *B*.\n2. immediately following the above code, a HMS connection is created for *B* for flushing metastore cache.\n3. the handler thread launches a background thread for query execution, which will first set the thread-local {{Hive}} instance using the handler's {{parentHive}} field, *which still refers to A*. So now *B* is overwritten by *A*!. There's no variable refers to *B*, and *B* holds a open HMS connection...\n4. the background thread executes the query, and opens new HMS connections.\n5. after the background thread is done, the handler thread will then set the thread-local {{Hive}} instance with {{sessionHive}}, which also points to *A*. So now the handler thread is using *A* again.\n\nAs result, the copy *B* is permanently lost, along with the connection.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=csun","name":"csun","key":"csun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=csun&avatarId=23340"},"displayName":"Chao Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-12T04:29:51.851+0000","updated":"2016-08-12T04:29:51.851+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-14524/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i328hb:"}}
