Maybe we should use the \"expected # executors\" instead of \"available # executors\" to decide the parallelism (fall back to what we do now if \"expected\" is unavailable, e.g. standalone mode).

This way, each executor may be assigned more reducers, but the job is less likely to fail because each reducer handles the expected amount of data.

I can see that prewarming executors is no longer needed if parallelism is determined by the expected executors. However, prewarming is meant for shor-lived sessions, such as ETL job launched by Oozie. For interactive sessions, this feature doesn't matter much. Therefore, we probably don't want to change the way of determining parallelism just for a less common use case.\n\nNow let's see if using expected number of executors to determine makes sense in the general case. In this case, we don't worry about the performance for the first query. Whether we have static or dynamic allocation, the parallelism is determined in the same way if we use the actual number of executors. On the other hand, if we use the expected number of executors, it seems the expected number of executors is undefined in case of dynamic allocation. Also, the expected may not always match the actual. If there is a big difference, there could be performance implications.\n\nIn conclusion, I can certainly see some benefits of using the expected number of executors. However, there also seem some unknowns as well. I think we don't have to make a call at this point. Maybe we can revisit once we learn more or get more user feedback?\n\nWhat do you think? \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-01-28T05:11:05.129+0000","updated":"2016-01-28T05:11:05.129+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12934647/comment/15120795","id":"15120795","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lirui","name":"lirui","key":"lirui","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rui Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Generally speaking, I think we have a better chance to get more reducers with expected resources, because RM won't allocate more resources than requested, right?
