A few comments:\nI don't think there's a need to explicitly close the ResultSet.  According to the JavaDocs on Statement.close(), it closes any associated ResultSets.  So making this call seems like a waste of time.\nIf we're going to do this, it should be done in CompactionTxnHanlder as well, since that subclasses this class and uses all of the same methods.\nBut that if leads to my last comment.  Is this necessary at all?  All of the public methods close the db connection as soon as they are done.
