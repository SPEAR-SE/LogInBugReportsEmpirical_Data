Hive creates a fresh URL classloader which includes the path of the current jar to be registered and all the jar paths of the parent classloader. The parent classlaoder is the current ThreadContextClassLoader. Once the URLClassloader is created Hive sets that as the current ThreadContextClassloader.\n\nSo if we register multiple jars in Hive, there will be multiple URLClassLoaders created, each classloader including the jars from its parent and the one extra jar to be registered. The last URLClassLoader created will end up as the current ThreadContextClassLoader. (See details: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.Utilities#addToClassPath)\n\nNow here's an example in which the above strategy can lead to a CNF exception.\nWe register 2 jars *j1* and *j2* in Hive console. *j1* contains the UDF class *c1* and internally relies on class *c2* in jar *j2*. We register *j1* first, the URLClassLoader *u1* is created and also set as the ThreadContextClassLoader. We register *j2* next, the new URLClassLoader created will be *u2* with *u1* as parent and *u2* becomes the new ThreadContextClassLoader. Note *u2* includes paths to both jars *j1* and *j2* whereas *u1* only has paths to *j1* (For details see: org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.Utilities#addToClassPath).\n\nNow when we register class *c1* under a temporary function in Hive, we load the class using {code} class.forName(\"c1\", true, Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()) {code} . The currentThreadContext class-loader is *u2*, and it has the path to the class *c1*, but note that Class-loaders work by delegating to parent class-loader first. In this case class *c1* will be found and *defined* by class-loader *u1*.\n\nNow *c1* from jar *j1* has *u1* as its class-loader. If a method (say initialize) is called in *c1*, which references the class *c2*, *c2* will not be found since the class-loader used to search for *c2* will be *u1* (Since the caller's class-loader is used to load a class)\n\n\nI've added a qtest to explain the problem.

Ratti","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"There are a few approaches in my mind on how to solve this problem.\n\n1. Do not use the current classloader as the parent when creating a new URLClassLoader in {{Utilities.addToClassPath}} method.  In this case, every URLClassLoader constructed will have, as its parent, the SystemClassLoader.  Also as per the {{addToClassPath}} method, every URLClassLoader  will  have all the jar paths from the parent (including the current jar to be registered).\n\nNow looking at the above scenario again class-loader *u2* will have as its parent the system class-loader and will have the jar paths for jars *j1* and *j2* both. Now, when *c1* is instantiated using the classloader *u2*, *u2* will load and define the class *c1* as the parent classloader will not have the jar. Now class *c2* required by *c1* will also be found in *u2* and will be correctly loaded and defined by *u2*.\n\nNote that {{Utilities.removeFromClassPath}} also creates new URLClassloaders without passing the current classloader as their parent.\n\n2. Have a new classloader which extends the URLClassloader and uses the servlet spec to load classes. That is instead of delegating to parent first, it first tries to find the class in its own classpath.\n\n3. Have a new classloader which extends the URLClassloader and which changes the scope of the {{addURL}} method from protected to public. Using this custom classloader we will not have to create fresh-classloaders for every jar being registered. We do have to think about how  delete/remove jars will be implemented.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdsr","name":"rdsr","key":"rdsr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ratandeep

Would there have been any good reason why Hive was originally keeping the old classloader around when resolving classes? One thing I can think of is that since it checks its parent classloader, when it loads a class it will end up using the oldest version of the classloader that is able to load this class.\n\nSo with this patch, if we had previously loaded a class with the previous classloader, and now load the class again with the current classloader, would there be any potential effects here? The 2 Class objects would not be considered the same, do we ever compare Class objects?

I'll try to look if we compare class-objects in the code. Some effects that come to mind are \n1. o instanceof c . If c is loaded by a classloader u1 and o is also an object of c, but the object's class was loaded by another classloader u2.\n2. casting may not work. (similar reasoning as above)\n\n[~jdere], [~ashutoshc] . I'd also like to get your opinion on approach 3, mentioned above, which is we do not create new classloaders for every jar, but add jars to the same classloader using the {{addURL}} method. We basically extend the URLClassLoader and change scope of the method addURL from protected to public. This can side step the potential problems that we are discussing here.  As for deleting jars in {{org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.exec.Utilities#removeFromClassPath}}, it can be exactly as before, except that it will not create an instance of URLClassloader but a subclass of it (with scope of addURL changed) and set that as the currentThreadContext classloader  and the Hadoop Configuration classloader.\n\nOne way to think about approach 3 is that it is exactly like what is currently being done, except that we register all the jars at once.  I haven't implemented approach 3 yet, wanted to get some opinion on it before I proceeded further.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdsr","name":"rdsr","key":"rdsr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ratandeep

I incorporated your suggestion where I create a fresh classloader when a new session is created. I use, as parent, the thread context classloader for the freshly created session classloader (See RB: https://reviews.apache.org/r/38663/) .  I have some doubts about using the thread context classloader as the parent.  This does not seem to provide clean isolation between jars/resources between different sessions.  Case in point: a thread context classloader could be a previous session's classloader .This can happen when the same thread was used  to work on a previous session, and is now being used to work on the newer current session. The thread context classloaer  could contain a different implementation of the same class also present in the session classloader. Do you see this a a problem?\n\n\nAnother potential problem I'm thinking about -- which is present in the proposed approach (see RB) is --  in HiveServer2 any worker thread can serve any request by mapping it to a persistent session. Couldn't this lead to a situation where for a specific session the session specific classloader (conf.getClassLoader()) and the thread context classloader end up being  different?  Say we have  two worker thread t1 and t2 .The  very first query is handled by t1 where a fresh session s1 is created along with a fresh classloader c1, which is  set as the session specific classloader and the thread context classloader. The next query for the same session is handled by t2. I guess since it is the same session s1, we do not create a fresh classloader. The session specific classloader is c1, but since it is a different thread and no classloader has been set on it, the thread will have the system classloader as its context classloader.

As to your comments:\n\n{quote}\nI have some doubts about using the thread context classloader as the parent. This does not seem to provide clean isolation between jars/resources between different sessions. Case in point: a thread context classloader could be a previous session's classloader .This can happen when the same thread was used to work on a previous session, and is now being used to work on the newer current session. The thread context classloaer could contain a different implementation of the same class also present in the session classloader. Do you see this a a problem?\n{quote}\nI think you are right, that the new session's classloader would be polluted with the loaded JARs from the thread's previous SessionState. What would be a better parent class loader to use here - the system class loader? Will it have any JARs added from the AUX_JARS options?\nChecking some of the various AUX_JARS related options, not sure if I missed any others:\n - HIVE_AUX_JARS_PATH environment variable: This gets added to the CLASSPATH, so the System class loader will have these\n - hive.aux.jars: As far as I can tell this is used when shipping JARs to the Map/Reduce tasks, so this does not seem to get used by the SessionState. Someone correct me if I am wrong.\n - hive.reloadable.aux.jars.path: These jars are added at the start of a HiveServer2 session, so it may not matter that the System class loader does not have these jars.\n\n{quote}\nAnother potential problem I'm thinking about – which is present in the proposed approach (see RB) is – in HiveServer2 any worker thread can serve any request by mapping it to a persistent session. Couldn't this lead to a situation where for a specific session the session specific classloader (conf.getClassLoader()) and the thread context classloader end up being different? Say we have two worker thread t1 and t2 .The very first query is handled by t1 where a fresh session s1 is created along with a fresh classloader c1, which is set as the session specific classloader and the thread context classloader. The next query for the same session is handled by t2. I guess since it is the same session s1, we do not create a fresh classloader. The session specific classloader is c1, but since it is a different thread and no classloader has been set on it, the thread will have the system classloader as its context classloader. Couldn't this cause potential CNF exceptions? If I understood correctly this problem also exists in the current implementation, doesn't it?\n{quote}\nI'm not sure if I understand the problem here - I believe that if a new thread handles an existing session, the thread calls Session.setCurrentSessionState() which should set the thread's context class loader to the SessionState's class loader. Or did I not understand the issue?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-28T18:24:07.119+0000","updated":"2015-10-28T18:24:07.119+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12875846/comment/14995540","id":"14995540","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdsr","name":"rdsr","key":"rdsr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ratandeep Ratti","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jdere]\n  Thanks for the comments.
