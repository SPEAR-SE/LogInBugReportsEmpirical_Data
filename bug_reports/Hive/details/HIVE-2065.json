Once I started writing a unit test for ensuring that the rcfile layout does stay in sync with sequence file layout, I also found that the classes designated as the keyclass/valueclass are no longer able to read themselves in or write themselves out, even if properly 'primed'.

We can still do that without this compatibility. \n\nSome inputs maybe useful to you:\nwe examined column groups, and sort the data internally based on one column in one column group. (But we did not try different compressions across column groups.) Tried this with 3-4 tables, and we see ~20% storage savings on one table compared the previous RCFile. The main problems for this approach is that it is hard to find out the correct/most efficient column group definitions.\nOne example, table tbl_1 has 20 columns, and user can define:\n\ncol_1,col_2,col_11,col_13:0;col_3,col_4,col_15,col_16:1;\n\nThis will put col_1, col_2,col_11, col_13 into one column group, and reorder that column group based on sorting col_1 (0 is the first column in this column group), and put col_3, col_4, col_15,col_16 into another column group, and reorder this column group based on sorting col_4, and finally put all other columns into the default column group with original order.\nAnd should be easy to allow different compression codec for different column groups.\n\nThe main block issue for this approach is have a full set of utils to find out the best column group definition.\n\nInstead of doing that in the existing RCFile, do you think it would be better if we can explore it in the new one that i just mentioned. If you think interesting, we can share you the existing code that we have for things i mentioned. And you can work on the compression codec based on the new one, and provide a util tool to find out the best column group definition.\n\nwhat do you think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=he+yongqiang","name":"he yongqiang","key":"he yongqiang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"He Yongqiang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-03-31T23:13:58.176+0000","updated":"2011-03-31T23:13:58.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12501852/comment/13014351","id":"13014351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=n_krishna_kumar","name":"n_krishna_kumar","key":"n_krishna_kumar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Krishna Kumar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"As I indicated, the reason I made changes for sequence file compatibility is that the original design was more or less compatible, but the compatibility is now currently broken.

To recap, 6.0 files have incorrect record length and while reading, we make the necessary recalculations to fix it up, while 6.1 onwards have the correct record length stored on disk.\n\n[PS. I had suggested bumping up the sequence file version to 7 in a comment above, but I think a minor version is a better idea. The layout itself is still 'kinda sorta' version-6-compatible. For all we know, there may be a sequence file version 7, and then sequence file version 7 and rc file version 7 would be divergent.]\n\n[PPS. For the sake of completeness of documentation, here are the reason why the layout, even after the current patch, is still short of complete version-6 compatibility : [a] The KeyBuffer, denoted as the key class, is unable to read or write itself from/to the disk stream as the reading/writing the 4-byte key contents length field and the compression/decompression are being done by the reader/writer and not the KeyBuffer class and [b] The ValueBuffer, the value class, must be compressed as a unit to be compatible to sequence file reader/writer, but it is actually compressed as several units.] ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=n_krishna_kumar","name":"n_krishna_kumar","key":"n_krishna_kumar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Krishna Kumar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-04-08T01:29:23.464+0000","updated":"2011-04-08T01:29:23.464+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12501852/comment/13071330","id":"13071330","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This one has been sitting in Patch Available queue for a while...are there issues that still need to be resolved?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jvs","name":"jvs","key":"jvs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Sichi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-07-26T20:13:50.148+0000","updated":"2011-07-26T20:13:50.148+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12501852/comment/13071335","id":"13071335","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=he+yongqiang","name":"he yongqiang","key":"he yongqiang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"He Yongqiang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"okay, i did a 'cancel patch'.
