Seems to me that it is been used UTF-8 but for Brazilian format we’ll need to use ISO-8859-1.\n\nIn the example above, when the data is loaded inside the table and we perform a simple select (Select * from sampletable) the text with accentuation is returned totally wrong and the double value with comma is returned as null.\nWe’ve already changed the variable LANG in enviroment and Hive variables with SET, but it doesn’t work so far.\n\nThank you in advance!!!\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"84385","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Encoding Issue - ISO-8859-1","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sergekm","name":"sergekm","key":"sergekm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergio Kameoka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sergekm","name":"sergekm","key":"sergekm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergio Kameoka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Amazon EMR with Hive (Hive 0.8.1 and haddop 1.0.3)","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614999/comment/14648654","id":"14648654","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=MuraliKParimi","name":"MuraliKParimi","key":"muralikparimi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Murali Krishna Parimi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Has this issue been resolved?
