The main reason is that the we need to analyze the select part first to get the schema of the target table and the operator tree, and use that schema to change the last moveTask and the metastore call to create the table. If we do it separately, the DDLSemanticAnalyzer need to recursively call SemanticAnalyzer and workthrough the intermediate result (operator tree) from the output of the SemanticAnalyzer to change the move task and add the DDLTask, and then call the rest of SemanticAnalyzer to generate mapredWork. That makes it more complex and error prone. I think with your refactoring SemanticAlayzer into LogicalPlan and PhysicalPlan, it will make it easier for separating CTAS to DDLSemanticAnalyzer.

It is more managable to review and have less chance of conflicting with other patches. \n\nSome detailed comments:\n\n1) the transform() function now returns void instead of ParseContext/LogicalPlan. This may be OK in the current implementation, but in general if we want to extend the rule-based rewrite system to cost based one, we probably need transform return a different LogicalPlan (the rewritten one) and keep the input plan unchanged. Then we can cost them. The optimize() function is similar, it should return the best plan given an input plan in the cost-based rewrite framework.\n\n2) I noticed that you removed some code and had a comment like \"possible bug\". Can you come up with some unit tests for such cases that the old code cause bugs? I've seen some diff in the unit test results under this patch, so I'm wondering whether they are caused by these changes.

CompileTimeOperator: contains information in ParseContext, and desc + DAG.\n2. desc + DAG: these are the information that needs to be propagated from compile time to execution time. We should put them together and give it a new name.\n3.
