Still some parts which should not have changed... Anyway. Actual review comments this time\n\n- Thread.sleep(PREEMPTION_KILL_GRACE_SLEEP_MS); - Think it is possible to replace this with a timed wait. Similar to the way the main scheduling loop waits for a fragment to complete or get scheduled before it tries to schedule the next one. That way we won't actually be sleeping for the entire 100ms.\n- Another nice to have bit would be to allow the element to go back into the queue, and fetch the latest from the queue - which could be at a higher priority. Don't think this is critical though.\n\n- In TaskRunnerCallable - killTask needs a minor change. shouldRunTask = false needs to be set independent of the (taskRunner) condition that it is under. Having a fragment wait outside the queue increases the possibility of an issue like this being hit. (The nice to have about putting the fragment back in the queue and waiting for the next schedule attempt would limit the possibility of other such issues, if they exist, as well)\n\n- Any chance of adding tests? The test class is setup with some controlled scheduling constructs to help with this. Suspect it'll need more work with the timed wait though.\n\n- System.nanoTime - replace with the Clock instance already used in the class. (Helps with unit tests to simulate time changes, may not be plugged in yet).\n\n- Nit: lastKillTimeNs - Long(null) vs long (-1/special value for unset)?\n\n- Not required.\n{code}\n// TODO: this can all be replaced by a Thread with a Runnable and a catch block\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-09T02:10:06.252+0000","updated":"2017-03-09T02:10:33.592+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13048151/comment/15902605","id":"15902605","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12856901/HIVE-16104.01.patch\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 1 test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 10335 tests passed\n\nTest results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/4040/testReport\nConsole output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/4040/console\nTest logs: http://104.198.109.242/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-Build-4040/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.TestCheckPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12856901 -

Wouldn't that block other ops like adding tasks?\n{quote}\nUsing isComplete as the wait mechanism has a race when the setIsCompleted() invocation happens in TaskRunnerCallable.\n{quote}\nWhat is the race? The wait is on the lock and so both wait and notify have to execute when the lock is taken. isComplete is also only examined under the same lock. So either the checker sees isComplete=true (after someone has set it and ran notify) and doesn't wait, or it sees false, so whoever notifies-All cannot notify before the checker releases the lock by going into wait, cause he needs the lock to notify; hence the waiting thread will get notified. Also isComplete is never unset, so that makes it even less problematic cause noone will set it to false.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-10T03:12:08.385+0000","updated":"2017-03-10T03:15:24.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13048151/comment/15904375","id":"15904375","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

(The same lock used in the main scheduling loop) - which gets a signal from all other opeartions.\n\nAlso, I think the loop can be simplified. trySChedule does not need to be done twice.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-10T03:41:52.278+0000","updated":"2017-03-10T03:41:52.278+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13048151/comment/15905856","id":"15905856","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated the loop, the lock and tests","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-10T23:19:21.875+0000","updated":"2017-03-10T23:19:21.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13048151/comment/15905932","id":"15905932","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12857429/HIVE-16104.04.patch\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 2 test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 10341 tests passed\n\nTest results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/4079/testReport\nConsole output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/4079/console\nTest logs: http://104.198.109.242/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-Build-4079/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.TestCheckPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12857429 -

A direct notifyAll to break out of the condition is ideal - that gets into the area of whether the main code should be modified for tests. Will probably require a wrapper wait interface which the test can control...
