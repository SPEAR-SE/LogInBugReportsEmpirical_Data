That way, it avoids one notion of confusion later on in the code (as in your patch) where we have to call it like this:\n\n{code}\n    conf.stripHiddenConfigurations(job);\n{code}\n\nIn that scenario, it becomes unclear if we're stripping it from conf, or from job, and the truth of the matter is that we're stripping it from job. If we made that call static, we can call HiveConf.stripHiddenConfigurations(job), which would be much clearer.\n\nI think, with that, I'm +1 on this. Thanks for adding in tests. Normally, for ql changes, such as with set behaviour, we make changes to .q files, which is easier to develop, but having a proper junit test as you have done is good too.
