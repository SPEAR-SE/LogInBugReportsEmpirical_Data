But the plan might be the following:\n{noformat}\nJoin(...)\n    Project(...)\n        Join(...)\n            ...\n    Filter(...)\n        ...\n{noformat} \nThus, first we need to pull up the Project operator(s) through Join(s) using HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule, to obtain:\n{noformat}\nProject(...)\n    Join(...)\n        Join(...)\n            ...\n    Filter(...)\n        ...\n{noformat} \nThen, HiveJoinToMultiJoinRule will find both Join operators and merge them. Finally, the Project operator(s) will be pushed down again throw the tree (this is done by HiveRelTrimmer).\n\n==\nProblem:\nHIVE-11223 enabled the return path for the cbo_rp_join0.q test.\nAt the same time, HIVE-11252 changed the application of the rules.\n- Before HIVE-11252, HiveJoinToMultiJoinRule was applied first, then HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule + HiveJoinToMultiJoinRule. This was merging the operators correctly, because no projects were found in between the Joins.\n- After HIVE-11252, only HiveJoinToMultiJoinRule + HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule are applied (this is correct). The problem is that 1) HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule.LEFT and HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule.RIGHT were not enabled, and 2) even if they were enabled, they were not working as expected (more on this below). That's why the test failed.\n\n==\nSolution:\nHiveJoinProjectTransposeRule.LEFT and HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule.RIGHT get enabled in the patch. In addition, JoinProjectTransposeRule was only working on inner joins, but we need it to work also on outer joins in Hive. That's why I had to bring so much code from the Calcite superclass (JoinProjectTransposeRule) to the Hive subclass (HiveJoinProjectTransposeRule) to solve the issue. I plan to create a Calcite patch so we can use JoinProjectTransposeRule with all kind of Joins.
