For queries with a lot of writers and thus under significant memory pressure this can have a significant impact on the memory usage. \n\nNote that \"hive.optimize.sort.dynamic.partition\" avoids this problem by sorting on the dynamic partition key and thus only a single ORC writer is open at once. This will use memory more effectively and avoid creating ORC files with very small stripes, which will produce better downstream performance.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12793328","id":"12793328","filename":"HIVE-13232.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen

But that is not seem to be a complete fix. To calculate the right value, we cannot use all bytes that a reserved, but should use bytes are filled. Thus I change the capacity() to position().\n    ```java  \n    public void flush() throws IOException {\n        spill();\n        if (compressed != null && compressed.position() != 0) {\n          compressed.flip();\n          receiver.output(compressed);\n    //Should move compress = null out of if block, (already been moved out in 2.1.0 code)\n    //otherwise its capacity will count for all following stripes even it is not used by them.\n          compressed = null;\n    }\n        uncompressedBytes = 0;\n        compressedBytes = 0;\n        overflow = null;\n        current = null;\n      }\n    ```\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/melode11/hive master\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/hive/pull/118.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #118\n    \n----\ncommit 5490d08733166c4a1ea5f6a50a3e74897bdbd011\nAuthor: Yuxing Yao <yuxyao@microsoft.com>\nDate:   2016-11-25T10:33:11Z\n\n    fix stripe size smaller than expected\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-11-25T10:55:11.774+0000","updated":"2016-11-25T10:55:11.774+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-13232/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2ucov:"}}
