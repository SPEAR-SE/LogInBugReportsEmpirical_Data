The workers will keep compacting but no one will be cleaning up.\n# How do we detect orphaned compactions in the waiting for cleaning state?  Minus something like ZK it's not immediately obvious to me how to figure out that a given metastore instance died or was shut down and that another cleaner should step in and take over.  You could wait a day or something, but even then you'd have to manage determining who stepped in.
