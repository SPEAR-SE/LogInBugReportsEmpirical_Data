We could do the same thing with addPartition() and other places where needed. The issue with this is it still breaks direct thrift clients. So a compromise is to use a conf variable - \"strict.owner.mode\" - if this is set to true on the server, dirs will not be created and they will be created on the client (both client and server should have the same value (true or false).  In installations where there are thrift clients, this can be set to false till the point the clients are ready to create the dirs themselves.\n\nHiveMetaStoreClient needs to change to read this conf variable and create dirs if it is set to true. This directory creation/deletion is relevant to create table/drop table/add partition/alter table/alter partition I think.\n\n\n \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pkamath","name":"pkamath","key":"pkamath","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pradeep Kamath","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-07-21T19:28:55.069+0000","updated":"2010-07-21T19:28:55.069+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469848/comment/12901991","id":"12901991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The above file attached for review is a patch generated by svn diff against revision 985768 off hive svn trunk.\n\nIt uses a new parameter \"hadoop.fs.operations.owner\" to determine whether or not a component is allowed to perform operations(write) on the filesystem. It defaults to true for HiveMetaStore, and defaults to false for HiveMetaStoreClient.\n\nTo run in thrift mode and get the behaviour described in this jira, we would need to override this parameter to false on the thrift server start, and true on the client side.\n\nThanks for reviewing and looking over this!\n\nOther comments : During testing, I wanted to disable filesystem access on the thrift server end, by providing an invalid fs.default.name - the idea being that if this patch covered all writing usecases, we would not need to write from the thrift end, and would not encounter any runtime failures. However, as you may guess, that didn't turn out to be the case, because we still read off it. We still perform path translations, we perform setLocation() on StorageDescriptors after getting appropriate paths, etc. Now this raised another further issue, wherein we'd potentially like this patch to be a bit more - to be able to move all fs ops to the client side if configured to be so, as that would be useful for integrating with secure hadoop, where the thrift server might not have access to the filesystem, and if it were to need access, it would need to keep requesting auth tokens. The idea there might be to have it be a pure metadata service. Anyhow, the intent now is to submit that as a separate feature-request jira, while leaving this one to address this.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-08-24T18:00:55.184+0000","updated":"2010-08-24T18:00:55.184+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12469848/comment/12901999","id":"12901999","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pkamath","name":"pkamath","key":"pkamath","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pradeep Kamath","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi,\n  I am out of the office on vacation from Friday Aug 20th to Friday, Sept 17th.
