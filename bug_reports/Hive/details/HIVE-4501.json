The benefit of explicitly closing the FS instead of just letting the GC collect it (by disabling the cache) seems to be that the deleteOnExit() calls will actually take effect. But I am not sure if hive code is relying on deleteOnExit() to happen on the client side. I haven't seen file/file handle leaks in long running HS2 . I believe the lease checker threads also go away when GC kicks in (based on my experience with long running HS2 with many queries).\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-27T20:52:22.597+0000","updated":"2013-09-27T20:52:22.597+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646151/comment/13780369","id":"13780369","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Making it patch available to kick off the tests.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-27T20:52:43.030+0000","updated":"2013-09-27T20:52:43.030+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646151/comment/13780531","id":"13780531","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
