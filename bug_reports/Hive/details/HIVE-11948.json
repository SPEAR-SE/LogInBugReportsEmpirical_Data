Why doesn't this get a txnid as parameter?  The caller should either know the txnid or know there isn't one.  Either way getTxnIdFromLockId() will not be needed.  This would be a Thrift change.\nWe should file a JIRA for that.  Same goes for comment at line 501.  We might just want to file an umbrella JIRA saying \"take care of TODOs in TxnHandler and CompactionTxnHandler\" and then we can file JIRAs for individual ones.\n\nTxnHandler, line 522:\n{code}\n     if (txnid > 0) {\n        heartbeatTxn(dbConn, txnid);\n     }\n    else {\n        heartbeatLock(dbConn, extLockId);\n    }\n{code}\n\nPreviously the code was:\n{code}\n heartbeatLock(dbConn, extLockId);\t\t\n ...\n if (txnid > 0)  heartbeatTxn(dbConn, txnid);\n{code}\nYou've changed the logic so that locks will only be heartbeat if there is no transaction.  I don't think that's what you want.\n\nTxnHander unlock(), around line 581, you moved the check that a lock is associated with a txn below the failure detection.  Are you depending on the db constraints to catch that the lock entry can't be deleted because a txn it is associated with still exists?  If so, that should be commented.

When there is a txn, only the txn needs to have heartbeat timestamp updated since that is the only timestamp checked for aborting an expired txn.  There is no way/reason to expire a single lock in a txn.  This simplifies both heartbeat and expiration operations (at least when there is a txn).\n\n\nTxnHander unlock(), around line 581.

So the unlock() operation runs in  a single SQL statement under most circumstances, but if the above SQL \"misses\", then there is some additional operations performed to produce a meaningful (best effort) message.  Previously this operation required 3 SQL statements in all cases.\n\nTxnHandler.getRequiredIsolationLevel(), line 2270.
