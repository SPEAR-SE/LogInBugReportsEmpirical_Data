forth over the network; it would be generated on the fly on the mapper node, and converted back to the standard format used (tab-delimited, I assume).\n\nThis seems like the simplest way for encoding type information in the input to mappers; it would also remove the need for silly boilerplate code that took a list of expected input column names, took the input stream, split it up, and made a dictionary of {column name: value} on every record.\n\nOutput schemas (USING '' AS ...) might also be redundant with this in place, but I'm not sure if that is
