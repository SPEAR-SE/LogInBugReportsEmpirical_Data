The inclusion of the code violates no bylaws of either Hive or Apache. For those who don't use Parquet, they probably never deal with these classes, but for those who do, these are important to them. I'm not sure what we gain by removing them.\n\nIf we think this is important for Hive, I'd be open to consider amending the current by-laws to apply going forward. In absence of such bylaw, I don't see a strong argument for the removal.\n\nAs to the case of HCat, I'm wondering how many releases have passed before it lands on the current package structure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-27T00:58:53.655+0000","updated":"2014-03-27T00:58:53.655+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12703808/comment/13948738","id":"13948738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am not sure if we need to have by-laws for things like this.
