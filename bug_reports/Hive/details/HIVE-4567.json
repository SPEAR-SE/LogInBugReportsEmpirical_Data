When such tables are used in the same query, a RuntimeException may occur.\n\nI realize that with Hive's built-in adapters, it may not ever be useful to create two external tables with the same location.  The following example is nonsensical but it can be used to easily reproduce the error:\n\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE f (fk STRING, name STRING)\nROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ' '\nLOCATION '/local/data/';\n\nCREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS p (pk STRING)\nLOCATION '/local/data/';\n\nSELECT p.pk\nFROM p LEFT OUTER JOIN f\nON p.pk = f.fk;\n\nIn /local/data, put file data.txt:\nk1 apple\nk2 orange\nk2 pear\n\nProduces the folllowing error:\n\nCaused by: java.lang.RuntimeException: cannot find field fk from [0:pk]\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.objectinspector.ObjectInspectorUtils.getStandardStructFieldRef(ObjectInspectorUtils.java:346)\n\tat org.apache.hadoop.hive.serde2.lazy.objectinspector.LazySimpleStructObjectInspector.getStructFieldRef(LazySimpleStructObjectInspector.java:168)\n...\n\n\nIdeally this should be supported by Hive as it is useful for semi-structured documents (e.g. JSON, XML) where multiple big \"relations\" may be contained in the same file.  However, if adding support is infeasible, it would be nice to detect this condition statically and raise a more meaningful error from the client process.  \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"328534","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"RuntimeException when two external tables have the same location","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojspieg","name":"jojspieg","key":"jojspieg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Josh Spiegel","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jojspieg","name":"jojspieg","key":"jojspieg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Josh Spiegel","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-4567/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1kmi7:"}}
