However, the existence of partition columns for a non-native table is problematic. Nothing disallows the table creation, and the documentation [1] does not mention that non-native tables cannot have partition columns. In fact, it suggests that \"PARTITIONED BY\" can be specified.\r\n\r\nWith this table definition, when running a query that does not launch a MR job, the query completes successfully and immediately, but no rows are ever returned. I have not yet been able to identify the specific code logic path that prevents it from working as expected, perhaps something in the query plan related to partition pruning.\r\n\r\nThis bug is similar to HIVE-18086. We see this issue with a query like \"select \\* from my_table;\" and the HIVE-18086 {{NullPointerException}} with a query like \"select count(\\*) from my_table;\".\r\n\r\nWe encountered this bug using the {{HBaseStorageHandler}}. However, enabling debug logging suggests that the query is being short-circuited without actually connecting to HBase at all.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StorageHandlers#StorageHandlers-DDL","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Simple select query finds nothing when non-native table has partition columns","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noslowerdna","name":"noslowerdna","key":"noslowerdna","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Olson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noslowerdna","name":"noslowerdna","key":"noslowerdna","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Olson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"CDH 5.5.5 on RHEL 6.8","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-18087/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3mwa7:"}}
