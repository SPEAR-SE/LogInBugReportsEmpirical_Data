This leads to creation of a new  JDOPersistenceManager per thread which are cached in JDOPersistanceManagerFactory. To remove JDOPersistenceManager from JDOPersistanceManagerFactory, an explicit JDOPersistenceManager.close needs to be called. \nThis is a bad candidate for thread local as the effective object destruction requires the application to call close. So, when metastore threads are killed by the threadpool, this object will never be removed from the JDOPersistanceManagerFactory cache.\nWe fixed this for HiveServer2 using embedded metastore (HIVE-7353) by customizing the GC collection of the dying thread, but I believe a better and more efficient solution is to pool JDOPersistenceManager objects and let each thread get an object for its use from the pool.\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JDOPersistenceManager creation should be controlled by at the Server level and not Thread level","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgumashta","name":"vgumashta","key":"vgumashta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vaibhav Gumashta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgumashta","name":"vgumashta","key":"vgumashta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vaibhav Gumashta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753492/comment/14535998","id":"14535998","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Removing fix version of 1.2.0 in preparation of release, since this is not a blocker for 1.2.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-09T00:11:34.388+0000","updated":"2015-05-09T00:11:34.388+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-8761/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i222nz:"}}
