Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Adding some general background info for anyone who wishes to work on this:\n\n(Note, this is not necessarily to do about Hive Export/Import, but about hive managed table partition creation in general, and the problem is that there isn't a \"good\" solution to this that won't bug someone the wrong way)\n\nGiven that the source can be any arbitrary table, even ones created by a user outside of hive, deciding what \"order\" to retain is tricky, or even difficult to know what \"order\" was used. This is so, since the source can have partition year=2012, hour=18, and yet have a directory that looks like any of the following:\n\n{noformat}\n/apps/hive/warehouse/weblogs/year=2012/hour=18\n/apps/hive/warehouse/weblogs/2012/18\n/apps/hive/warehouse/weblogs/201218/\n/apps/hive/warehouse/weblogs/frank/\n{noformat}\n\nThus, we do not store the correlation between partition key-values in source and destination, and the only thing we \"know\" is that a partition with a set of key-value-pairs is associated with some data that we read. Thus, in the destination, irrespective of what the source said about the dir name, we ignore it, and recreate a partition based only on key-value pair info, and let hive default loading mechanism pick the location for us.\n\n==\n\nThe underlying problem here is this : currently, the list of key-values is stored as a HashMap which is not ordered, and thus, is not guaranteed to be identical across JDKs or OSes. This doesn't currently affect us, however, since it's only relevant at the time a partition is created, and as long as the metadata for the data is consistent to point to the correct location, hive doesn't care.\n\nSince we don't force an order, that order is whatever native sorting order for that HashMap would be for those values, on that JDK version + OS. This means that as long as you don't change JDK version + OS + the keyvalues, it is repeatably consistent. Change even one of those, however, and you could easily wind up with this differing. This can even happen with Hive wherein we've done \"ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION\" for a while on a cluster, upgrade a jdk, and then we do another \"ALTER TABLE ADD PARTITION\", and it picks dd/mm instead of mm/dd that it has been for a while. Or, if one machine was on ubuntu and the other on centos/etc.\n\nSome possible solutions:\na) We can force order of key-values by order of key occurence in the metastore for all \"new\" partitions ever created in hive. The problem with this is that it might force additional metastore calls to determine this order(adding load).\nb) We can force alphabetical order of key-values for all \"new\" partitions ever created in hive. The problem with this is that we now get into a notion of what is alphabetical order in what codepage (although that can still deterministic). It's also possible that going alphabetical will cause a pretty \"dumb\" ordering, where \"dumb\" in this case can mean  (i) non-intuitive : Say day=23/market_id=45/month=4/year=2016 , or (ii) bad in terms of skew, having a higher frequency partition separation be a parent of a lower freq one, resulting in a much larger number of dirs created.\n\nNeither of these solve the original issue of export/import, because all we wind up doing here is forcing order going forward, and not making sure to \"retain\" whatever existed. Also, if a JDK/OS combination resulted in a different default for two different users for similar schema, then by \"standardizing\" it going forward, we break convention for one of them, either way.\n\nEven in the cases where currently, export/import has been flipping a mm/dd/yyyy into a dd/mm/yyyy, for eg., if we standardize to fix it to retain original order, we make it weird for a bunch of users that have had a mm/dd/yyyy in place, and don't care about the order as long as it is consistent across the table(a goal I'd argue they shouldn't have/care about, but nevertheless one that might exist)\n\nOther solutions that are possible:\n\na) Let a table specify that it cares about its default partition-naming-scheme : Similar to what  hcat.dynamic.partitioning.custom.pattern does for HCat . The problem with this is it can introduce complexity to a warehouse if people use this feature extensively - i.e. it does actually nothing for the data and perf in hive - it's simply for usability with external tools, and we run into a too-many-configs-why-was-this-feature-even-here scenario, but maybe we can ignore that.\n\nb) Change export/import to honour existing order in the case of managed tables (but ignore order or customization for external tables, because we truly cannot determine what patterns might be used for external tables ) - this does not help existing export/import cases, and can decide on a different norm for a bunch of users, but does help a little going ahead.\n\nSorry for the longer than intended ramble, but this problem has been known about for a while and wasn't fixed because of these, and I wanted to provide context.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-02T18:58:57.794+0000","updated":"2016-05-02T18:58:57.794+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12963811/comment/15272635","id":"15272635","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=luky","name":"luky","key":"luky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lukas Waldmann","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I just wonder how come there is no definition of order of partitions -
