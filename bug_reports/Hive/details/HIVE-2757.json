Shaposhnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's an example patch that is not meant for inclusion, but rather to generate discussion whether such an approach would be acceptable.\n\nBasically, the fundamental problem is that Hive java code can be used in other projects (like Oozie) and hence it can't rely on launcher shell scripts always passing correct set of properties along based on querying the environment at shell level.\n\nThis unique feature of Hive makes discovery of Hadoop executor script happen at the level of Java code. The patch contains a very naive attempt at doing that while maintaining backward compatibility with Hadoop 0.20.X and older releases.  The most notable feature that is still missing is an ability to discover Hadoop that's part of the user's PATH. Before I implement that, however, I'd like to ask whether exec'ing via ProcessBuilder won't be a better option, rather than me manually tying to parse PATH (error prone).\n\nPlease let me know what you think.\n\nP.S.

This unique feature of Hive makes discovery of Hadoop executor script happen at the level of Java code.\n\nJust to make sure I understand, you're saying that right now the bin/hive shell script calls bin/hadoop, and you want to modify it so that bin/hive bypasses bin/hadoop and instead calls java directly with the appropriate Hive class? That sounds like an improvement to me. Even better would be to eliminate the Hive shell scripts entirely (or at least whittle them down to nothing) and push most of this logic into Java.\n\nNote that we're actually moving in the direction of removing the dependency on bin/hadoop entirely.

So I had to make some changes in local mode job submission codes to directly invoke Hadoop instead of going through Hadoop scripts. I am attaching the changes as a patch in case you folks find it useful. I took the liberty of defining couple of new properties so that it would continue to work with Hadoop scripts as normal if above properties are not explicitly set. Anyway this doesn't take away the HADOOP_HOME requirement to start hive using hive scripts since they are heavily dependent on being HADOOP_HOME set. In my case this was sufficient since I was starting Hive server programatically without going through hive scripts.
