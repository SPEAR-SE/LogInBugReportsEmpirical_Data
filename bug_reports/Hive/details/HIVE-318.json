The init and state code can be moved to Operator.java and the reset logic can be refactored to work on those states. There is no need for another reinit state. Init after close should be transparently allowed.\n3. We can change the plan to generate two different file sink operators on the parents of the union operator while breaking the into map/reduce jobs. If we follow that strategy, we can undo the changes to FileSinkOperator\nand remove the special case code.\n4.
