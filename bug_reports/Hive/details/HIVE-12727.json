It seems to me that we should just revert default to nonstrict.\n\nFact that there is a flag means that different settings exists for different use cases. My thinking for changing default to strict was assumption that we want Hive to be geared for production use cases and not for pocs/benchmarks/ease-of-use.  Assumption is before deploying to production, user will first test their queries and then during that testing throwing exception will force user to reconsider queries they are writing and force them to make a conscious choice to set flag to false if they think they still want it.  Assumption was you want flag to be strict *always* in production and have set to nonstrict selectively for limited query set where you absolutely want other way. Since, no one thinks the way I am : ), I guess we should just set flag to non-strict, instead of adding level of strictness.  \n \nAlso, consider renaming config variable to hive.exec.mode (or some such) Having mapred in the name is going to be confusing to user as they may think this is not applicable to tez/spark/llap which isnt the case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-22T22:35:43.130+0000","updated":"2015-12-22T22:35:43.130+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12923650/comment/15068952","id":"15068952","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I concur that it doesn't seem very pleasing to have another mode and that in production the flag should be on.

importance to ease of use. In this case, path of least astonishment subcategory of ease of use :)\n\nThe strict mode is trying to enforce two categories of checks - \n 1. Prevent use of questionable semantics\n 2. Prevent use of queries that can potentially take too much of cluster resources, which have some symptoms of poorly written queries. \n\nI think current config is doing a poor job of doing the 2nd check. It is relying on heuristics that rely on the operations in the query. Ideally, these checks should consider the actual cost of the query. For example, if the result of a query is small, or if hive.optimize.sampling.orderby=true, it should be perfectly OK to have a order-by without limit. In case of tables that have a small number of partitions, it should be OK to have no partition clause in the query. \nI think the 2nd category of checks are not mature enough to be enabled by default, while the first category is.\n\nAlso, note that the 2nd category of checks are also likely to break general BI tools as they won't be aware of these idiosyncrasies of hive.\n\nI propose that we split the checks clearly into above two categories and enable only the first kind by default.\n\nHow to separate the checks into two ? I think the category of semistrict and strict is confusing.  It would be clearer to give names for the categories of checks.\nMaybe support comma separated list of categories of checks to be enforced ?\n\nHow about calling the parameter hive.strict.checks and supporting list values of \"semantic\" and \"largequerypattern\" (or similar) ? \n\nThe equivalent of current strict mode becomes - \nhive.strict.checks=semantic,largequerypattern\n\nThe new default used becomes -\nhive.strict.checks=semantic\n\nThoughts ?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-01-21T06:32:21.915+0000","updated":"2016-01-21T06:32:21.915+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12923650/comment/15111134","id":"15111134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"That sounds good to me.
