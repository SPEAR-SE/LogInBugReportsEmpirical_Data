The logic seems not to apply the PathFilter for first file alone. For other cases it works fine as there is a while loop in next() which keeps iterating to next valid file by applying filter. So in case of (a,_s,b), first file is a for which no filter is applied. For the next file _s filter is applied and next becomes null. But the while continues to next valid file in which case its b. So finally only (a,b) is returned. The iterator will not return null under any case.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasanth_j","name":"prasanth_j","key":"prasanth_j","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasanth
