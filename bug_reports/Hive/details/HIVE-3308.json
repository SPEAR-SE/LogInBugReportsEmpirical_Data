LazySimpleSerDe using compression so should be a .snappy file.\nThis causes any job (exception select * from avrotable is that not truly a job) to show null values.\nIf you use any serde other then avro you can temporarily fix this by setting \"set hive.output.file.extension=.snappy\" and it will correctly work again but this won't work on avro since it overwrites the hive.output.file.extension during initializing.\n\nWhen you dump the query result into a table with \"create table bla as\" you can rename the .avro file into .snappy and the \"select from bla\" will also magiacally work again.\n\nInput and Ouput serdes don't always match so when I use avro as an input format it should not set the hive.output.file.extension.\nOnces it's set all queries will use it and fail making the
