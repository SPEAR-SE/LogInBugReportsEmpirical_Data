This has caused various problems in the past (text field limitations, perf issues when parsing a giant string; also bugs because the way it is set is brittle).\r\nHowever, now that we are implementing transactional stats, it becomes especially problematic and error prone because the code in Hive sets C_S_A in random places with reckless abandon, whereas we want to change the state of the stats in well defined places where txn semantics can be verified.\r\nCurrently in HIVE-19416, we are handling random things that touch it (from metastore itself to output committers, various stats tasks, commands like truncate, etc.) via a pile of hacks, but the best solution would be to remove it completely and replace with a DB table/columns in stats tables that would need to be set explicitly, not via generic alter_table.\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12934369","id":"12934369","filename":"HIVE-20109.nogen.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey

stats storage as part of table parameters, and there won't be a runtime backward compat that would generate json values from normalized storage.\r\nThere will be an upgrade option to transfer the json object into the new fields; given that the consequence of not running the upgrade script is a one-time loss of accurate stats, this should be acceptable.\r\nI'm looking at the code to see how easy it is to normalize table stats storage into a separate table, so that the TBLS and PARTITIONS are not even affected by stats changes (that is good for CachedStore).\r\nRegardless, as is already the case with column stats, the basic stats state will be updated via a separate API from alter table to make it more
