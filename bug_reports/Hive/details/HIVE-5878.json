If the data type of expression and aggregate results in Hive was reasonable before, I think it would be best to leave the type the same as it was, for backward compatibility, so we don't break people's applications. \n\nAlso, the vectorized implementation of aggregates was built to return the same data types as the row-at-a-time implementation, for compatibility. It is important that any changes in semantics or types be implemented in both the row-at-a-time, and vectorized execution paths.\n\nDifferent database systems make different choices about expression and aggregate result types. For example, in SQL Server, avg applied to an int is an int:\n\n{code}\ncreate table test(i int);\nselect avg(i) avg_i into res2 from test;\n{code}\n\ngives table res2 with this schema:\n\n{code}\nCREATE TABLE [dbo].[res2](\n\t[avg_i] [int] NULL\n) \n{code}\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ehans","name":"ehans","key":"ehans","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468"},"displayName":"Eric Hanson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-06T17:18:21.963+0000","updated":"2013-12-06T17:18:21.963+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12680881/comment/13841449","id":"13841449","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ehans","name":"ehans","key":"ehans","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468"},"displayName":"Eric Hanson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To be clear, I think the existing Hive behavior, where the result of avg(<integer-expression>) is a double, is reasonable behavior and should not be changed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ehans","name":"ehans","key":"ehans","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468"},"displayName":"Eric Hanson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-06T17:29:27.958+0000","updated":"2013-12-06T17:29:27.958+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12680881/comment/13841516","id":"13841516","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ehans] Thank you for your concern. However, I respectfully disagree that the behavior WAS and IS reasonable for several reasons. First, AVG was probably introduced before decimal, so there was no better choice than double. Hive has the concept of exact types (int, long, decimal, etc.) vs approximate types (double, float, etc), and Arithmetic operations (plus, divide, etc) on exact types generates exact type for accuracy. If average is defined mathematically as sum/count, then sum(int)/count should result an exact type. Otherwise, avg() and sum()/count give different result. Another inconsistency exists when avg(decimal) results a decimal. All those cause inconsistency in Hive's mathematical concept and function behavior, and can create confusions among users as well.\n\nI understand vectorized current implementation chooses double for sum and uses sum/count to get another double for average. While this extends the scope of the changes, to me, however, vectorization is just implementation, which should not dictate high-level concept and consistency.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-06T18:26:06.144+0000","updated":"2013-12-06T18:26:06.144+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12680881/comment/13841534","id":"13841534","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ehans","name":"ehans","key":"ehans","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ehans&avatarId=16468"},"displayName":"Eric Hanson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To me, the issue is really about the importance of obeying the SQL standard (which would argue for using exact types for results in the situations the standard describes) vs. maintaining backward compatibility.\n\nI don't think that accuracy is the issue.

There are some significant effects for users if we decide to go with the change to returning decimal type (both for avg and for int / int).\n\n1) As I mentioned in HIVE-5356, there is a significant performance hit to switching to decimal arithmetic.  I suppose for avg() there could be some ways to improve this for int type, such as keeping the sum/count portions as long, and only doing decimal math when computing sum / count.\n\n2) Decimal arithmetic can return NULL for some non-null inputs, if Hive is not able to represent the entire result exactly.  While most common cases (such as the example in HIVE-5022) should not longer occur, in the general case it is still possible to get a NULL result if the expression contains enough operations.  I know, there has been some discussion on this already, and some of the reasoning behind why those semantics were ok for decimal arithmetic was that if the user had made the choice to use decimal columns/types, then they knew what they were getting into with the decimal arithmetic.  But in this case users are going to start seeing the effects of these decimal semantics all over the place because they will start getting applied on expressions involving integer columns.  I don't think that users will find this NULL behavior desirable with their integer expressions, so I think something will need to be done one way or another here - either don't return decimal type in these situations, or possibly address this null behavior in some way.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-09T19:26:51.568+0000","updated":"2013-12-09T19:26:51.568+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12680881/comment/13843882","id":"13843882","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"For information, the follow is the text from SQL-92[1] standard w.r.t AVG function:\n\n{quote}\n            c) If AVG is specified and DT is exact numeric, then the data\n              type of the result is exact numeric with implementation-\n              defined precision not less than the precision of DT and\n              implementation-defined scale not less than the scale of DT.\n{quote}\n\nClearly, currently Hive deviates from this.
