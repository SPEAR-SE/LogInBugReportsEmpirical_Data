I've looked through the source code for Spark, Storm, Flume, Pig, and Oozie and no one is using the org.apache.orc classes and they using the original org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc class names. \n\nUnfortunately, Hive's users now can't use both the current ORC library and Hive 2.0.1 or Hive 2.1.0. That really sucks and will cause a lot of problems down stream. By just renaming the packages to org.apache.hive.orc, we won't change the functionality and the two versions of ORC will live side by side.\n\nWhile the org.apache.orc package is an implementation detail from Hive's point of view, it is the primary API for ORC.

If I'm not mistaken you're talking about 100 classes which are pretty much all of ORC. 70 of those are non-test classes. Since hive used to be until very recently the only source of orc I also don't see a way to guarantee that no one else is using these classes and wouldn't be affected by changing this on released lines going back over 6 months.\n\nI also get that you don't want to change those in ORC upstream now. That would mean you have to move a lot of stuff out of the way.\n\nAs a consequence I think the best thing to do is nothing for 2.0 and 2.1. If someone wants to use ORC with hive on the classpath in those versions they should probably just use the hive classes. Starting with hive 2.2 they will be able to switch to ORC proper. If they absolutely must suck in the new ORC project they should probably shade it in their code for the time being.
