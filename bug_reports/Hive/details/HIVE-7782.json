Now this may make sense since it's connected a Tez session by that point but it's also misleading because the job progress output in the cli changes to look like MapReduce rather than Tez and the query time is increased from 8 to to 15-16 secs but still less than the 25-30+ secs I usually see with MR. The Resource Manager shows both of these jobs as TEZ application type regardless of setting hive.execution.engine=mr.

This setting causes all native MR jobs in this session to be sent to Tez for execution. \n\n\nWhen the execution engine is changed to MR (i.e. set hive.execution.engine=mr), this setting change is not reverted. So, the subsequent query, which used to go to native MR, now goes to Tez instead (as MR on Tez). That's why its faster than native MR, but slower than native Tez.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pala","name":"pala","key":"pala","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pala M Muthaia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-13T23:01:22.745+0000","updated":"2014-10-13T23:01:22.745+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-7782/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1z207:"}}
