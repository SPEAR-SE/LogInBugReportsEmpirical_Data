If you dont provide support for that in LazySimpleSerDe (which is probably not a big change, i might be mistaken though), then for my requirement, we would have to go through the process of creating a new SerDe. And once we create that serde I'd rather use it than LazySimpleSerDe for all of my future requirements. I am guessing that pretty soon we would have to deprecate LazySimpleSerDe in favor of this new serde because of its expressibility.\n\nRegarding automatically detecting the serialization format for arrays in the data, maybe I am mistaken, but arent you already using some logic to create LazySimpleSerDe when the metastore has MetadataTypedColumnSetSerDe for that table? In that same logic, cant you add a parameter to the lazy serde to indicate which array serialization format to use?\n\nAgain, I am not suggesting that we should add several serialization formats to the same SerDe.

Then another serde to support maps of arrays and so on. I'd rather we make the decision and the code changes now such that LazySerDe becomes the default general serde for nested maps and arrays. I am not saying that you need to make lazy serde support everything as part of this jira. But, what I am hoping for is the decision to *add* support for nested structures to LazySimpleSerDe rather than creating yet another wafer thin serde.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-12T01:54:20.313+0000","updated":"2009-03-12T01:54:20.313+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416592/comment/12681165","id":"12681165","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, let's discuss tomorrow whether our current focus is only to fix this blocker, or we want to add new features at the same time.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-12T05:29:14.886+0000","updated":"2009-03-12T05:29:14.886+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416592/comment/12682962","id":"12682962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"First cut.\n\nThe code is written in a way to make sure it's very easy to extend to nested types.\n\nI also replaced DynamicSerDe/TBinaryProtocol for map-reduce value to LazySimpleSerDe.

Move factory methods in LazyUtils to LazyFactory;\n\n2. LazyArray etc should use Factory methods (with TypeInfo as parameter) to create elements;\n\n3. Comment that LazySimpleSerDe only supports 10 levels of separators currently.\n\n4. Use a global pointer to byte[], and all LazyObjects should point to the global pointer.\nThis helps with garbage collection.\n\n5. More Javadoc.\n\n6. Move the 3 fields (bytes, start, length) from LazyNonPrimitive to LazyObject, add \"parsed\" to LazyPrimitive.\nThis makes the code cleaner because all LazyObjects now behave in the same way - nothing happens in setAll (but cached the values), and actual parsing happens later.\nThe trade-off is that LazyPrimitive takes more memory - 12 bytes for bytes, start, and length.\n\nFor 6, a better way would be to always directly parse the data when \"setAll\" is called (basically, convert the way LazyNonPrimitive works to the way that LazyPrimitive works.) The reason is that there is no point of \"setAll\" if we don't need to parse the data later, so why don't we directly parse the data in the \"setAll\" call?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-03-24T03:39:29.668+0000","updated":"2009-03-24T03:39:29.668+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12416592/comment/12688599","id":"12688599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Done with all the comments except 6.\n\nI also renamed the setAll() function to init() to make it clearer.\n\nBecause we now pass TypeInfo around in LazyObject hierarchy, we don't even need to create the LazyObject for an array element if that element is never accessed (we can create it on demand when it's accessed).\n\nThe current code works fine without the change of 6.  The change of 6 requires either 12 bytes more storage per primitive object (by adding the byte[], int, int to the LazyPrimitive), or more complicated logic in removing the int start and int length from LazyNonPrimitive (we will have to parse the data right in init(..) but we don't have access to the separators because it's in the next-level ObjectInspectors - unless we add the pointers from LazyObject to ObjectInspector, but that's another overhead and complicates the data structure).\n\nAfter all, the implementation of init() is private to the class and I don't think there is a strong need to make the implementation the same across LazyPrimitive and LazyNonPrimitive. The fact that the parsing of LazyPrimitive does not require delimiters and LazyNonPrimitive requires is good enough for them to have different implementations.\n\n\nFuture improvements include:\n1.
