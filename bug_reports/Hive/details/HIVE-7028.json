Unfortunately, this is a huge hassle because that code is only published as the shaded (uber jar) {{hive-exec}} artifact, so it can't be used in another project without repackaging it to remove all the shaded classes.\n\nThere are many ways to solve this, but I think this one is easiest:\n\n# Remove the shade plugin from the {{ql}} module so that it produces a standard JAR with normal Maven dependencies\n# Rename the artifactId in the {{ql}} module from {{hive-exec}} to {{hive-ql}}\n# Create a new module, {{exec}}, with artifactId {{hive-exec}}, that produces the shaded JAR using the rules were removed from the {{ql}} module above\n\nThe result of this should be the same as before, except it will also produce an additional {{hive-ql}} JAR that can be easily used other Maven projects.\n\nIf this plan is acceptable, I can send a patch for this.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"391458","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Publish normal JAR artifact for hive-ql","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=electrum","name":"electrum","key":"electrum","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Phillips","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=electrum","name":"electrum","key":"electrum","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Phillips","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-7028/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1vdtj:"}}
