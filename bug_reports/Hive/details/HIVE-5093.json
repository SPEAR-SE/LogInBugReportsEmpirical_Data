This optimization can lead to significant performance boost for such queries and the code change required is not significant as demonstrated by attached WIP patch. \nI agree that we should look at different ways of adding this optimization. \n\nAs Gopal suggested, using a different sort function for map is one option for the order-by queries. \n\nThe fact that hive uses map-side aggregation is something to consider for optimizing the group-by case. One option would be to push the limit into the map-side aggregation operator, that will also reduce its memory requirements. But that is probably little more complicated than this change which is more factored out in a separate combiner code.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-19T17:08:40.820+0000","updated":"2013-08-19T17:08:40.820+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663731/comment/13744063","id":"13744063","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gopalv","name":"gopalv","key":"gopalv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gopal V","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~appodictic]: HIVE-3562 is actually doing this in the map-side aggregation with a java.util.SortedMap. \n\nI wrote the combiner version for memory efficiency, which is relatively simple as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gopalv","name":"gopalv","key":"gopalv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gopal V","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-08-19T17:56:21.955+0000","updated":"2013-08-19T17:56:21.955+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663731/comment/13744083","id":"13744083","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I have to think this over a little bit.
