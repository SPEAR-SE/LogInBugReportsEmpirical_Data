I hadn't considered expanding GetOperationStatus. I agree that we should try re-use existing methods before adding a new API.\n\nI looked at GetOperationStatus and seems to me that it will make code more complicated to add this method there. As you point out, this call is polling on a running Operation's state, which is set (in Operation) before or after executing the query (i.e. before or after driver.run()).  However, setting the jobIDs in OperationState during currently running MR/Tez tasks would mean making the Operation reference available to the Driver/DriverContext.  Alternatively, we could add operation.getJobIDs in CliServer.getOperationStatus(), however, that seems pretty unclean as those are two separate operations. \n\nOverall I think, keeping the two APIs separate is also cleaner (and less surprising to users) since most users interested in polling for operation status are not interested in JobIDs.\n\nLet me know what you think.

I have more review time now :)\n\nI believe there is a natural \"has many\" association between an operation and the jobs it launches. In fact, the job ids come into existence only when the OperationState transitions to RUNNING. I think operation.getJobIDs will be a useful call to add. So in that sense, IMO there is nothing wrong by returning more related information with GetOperationStatus. Another benefit of doing that is that now, you don't have another potentially polling call that some clients of the thrift API can use in future (I feel polling calls are risky if the server does not have control over them!). In case of GetOperationStatus, CLIService.getOperationStatus prevents the server from getting bombarded by frequent polling RPC calls by using a long polling approach which you don't have to rewrite.\n\nHowever, one issue that I overlooked was the network traffic that it might increase if we return job ids with each call to GetOperationStatus which is used pretty frequently in JDBC driver. We could expand TGetOperationStatusResp to handle that in the following backward compatible manner:\n{code}\nstruct TGetOperationStatusReq {\n  // Session to run this request against\n  1: required TOperationHandle operationHandle\n  2: optional bool getJobIds = false\n}\n\nstruct TGetOperationStatusResp {\n  1: required TStatus status\n  2: optional TOperationState operationState\n  // If operationState is ERROR_STATE, then the following fields may be set\n  // sqlState as defined in the ISO/IEF CLI specification\n  3: optional string sqlState\n  // Internal error code\n  4: optional i32 errorCode\n  // Error message\n  5: optional string errorMessage\n  6: optional bool hasJobIds = false\n  7: optional list<string> jobIds\n}\n{code}\nIn this way, clients which are interested in getting the job ids, can construct the appropriate request object. \n\n[~thejas] What are your thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgumashta","name":"vgumashta","key":"vgumashta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vaibhav Gumashta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-18T07:48:04.599+0000","updated":"2014-11-18T07:48:04.599+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12749975/comment/14215852","id":"14215852","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgumashta","name":"vgumashta","key":"vgumashta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vaibhav Gumashta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mohitsabharwal] One main reason why I am trying to reason a bit more about the need for a new API call is because the Metastore API seems to have suffered over a period of time by adding too many new methods.
