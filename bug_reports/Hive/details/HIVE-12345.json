Unsure why this test is failing in ptest framework.\n * org.apache.hadoop.hive.hwi.TestHWISessionManager.testHiveDriver : hit a java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/hdfs/DistributedFileSystem . This might be transient, or a test env issue.\n * org.apache.hive.jdbc.TestSSL.testSSLVersion : This one is weird, because it expected an SQLException on trying to connect but didn't find one. Does not seem related, but a good candidate to look into further.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-05T22:20:45.882+0000","updated":"2015-11-05T22:20:45.882+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12910667/comment/14992784","id":"14992784","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching port of patch for branch-1.2 as well.
