Otherwise, at runtime to filter this out may cause more time.\n\n2)\nadded a null check for back up tasks. Otherwise will see NullPointerException\n\n3)\nCommonJoinResolver needs to know a full mapping of pathToAliases. Otherwise it will make wrong decision.\n\n4)\nchanges made to the ConditionalResolverCommonJoin: added pathToAliases, aliasToSize (alias's input size that is known at compile time, by inputSummary), and intermediate dir path.\nSo the logic is, go over all the pathToAliases, and for each path, if it is from intermediate dir path, add this path's size to all aliases. And finally based on the size information and others like aliasToTask to choose the big table. \n\n5)\nConditional task's children contains wrong options, which may cause join fail or incorrect results. Basically when getting all possible children for the conditional task, should use a whitelist of big tables. Only tables in this while list can be considered as a big table.\nHere is the logic:\n\n* Get a list of big table candidates. Only the tables in the returned set can be used as big table in the join operation.\n* The logic here is to scan the join condition array from left to right. \n** If see a inner join and the bigTableCandidates is empty, add both side of this inner join to big table candidates. \n** If see a left outer join, and the bigTableCandidates is empty, add the left side to it, and \n** if the bigTableCandidates is not empty, do nothing (which means the bigTableCandidates is from left side). \n** If see a right outer join, clear the bigTableCandidates, and add right side to the bigTableCandidates, it means the right side of a right outer join always win. \n** If see a full outer join, return null immediately (no one can be the big table, can not do a
