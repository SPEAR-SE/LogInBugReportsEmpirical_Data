INSERT queries with UNION ALL will create sub-directories under table/partition directory. For example:\n{code}\ninsert overwrite table outputTbl1\nSELECT *\nFROM (\n  SELECT key, count(1) as values from inputTbl1 group by key\n  UNION ALL\n  SELECT key, count(1) as values from inputTbl1 group by key\n) a;\n{code}\n\nfor the above query, the warehouse/outputTbl1 directory will have 2 sub-directories corresponding to each SELECT queries like\nwarehouse/outputTbl1/15/, warehouse/outputTbl1/16/. Here 15 and 16 are operator identifiers https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/ql/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/ql/optimizer/unionproc/UnionProcFactory.java#L223\n\nThis special case (having directory under table) happens only for union insert. All other cases will have files underneath the table directory for unpartitioned tables. But the metastore utils for updating the fast stats are not aware of this directory structure (it expects files underneath table directory).  The Warehouse.getFileStatusesForUnpartitionedTable() recurses only one level under table directory if it is unpartitioned table https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/trunk/metastore/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/metastore/Warehouse.java#L540. For union insert, if only 1 level is recursed you will get only the folder sizes and not the actual file sizes. Folder sizes are different for different OSes. It looks like original diff was generated using Mac OS X and the new diff was generated using Centos. Both the diffs are *wrong* as they return folder size as opposed to file sizes. \n\n1) One way to fix this is to change the recurse level to a value greater than 1. \n2) Another way would be to fix UNION to create files instead of directories. To resolve filename conflict it can append the operator id to filename.\n\n[~ashutoshc]/[~jdere] do you guys have any thoughts about this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasanth_j","name":"prasanth_j","key":"prasanth_j","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasanth Jayachandran","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-23T01:11:12.388+0000","updated":"2014-04-23T01:11:12.388+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709895/comment/13977712","id":"13977712","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasanth_j","name":"prasanth_j","key":"prasanth_j","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasanth Jayachandran","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Cancelling the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasanth_j","name":"prasanth_j","key":"prasanth_j","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasanth Jayachandran","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-23T01:27:06.152+0000","updated":"2014-04-23T01:27:06.152+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709895/comment/13987161","id":"13987161","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Prasanth has fixed these failures with HIVE-6979","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-01T23:19:48.845+0000","updated":"2014-05-01T23:19:48.845+0000"}],"maxResults":6,"total":6,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-6958/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1uvhz:"}}
