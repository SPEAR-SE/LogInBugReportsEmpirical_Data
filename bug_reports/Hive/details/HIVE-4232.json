We propose controlling the QOP with another parameter qop=auth|auth-int|auth-conf. The patch also takes care of case-sensitive value comparisons.\n\nI feel that these changes result in a more reasonable set of defaults and don't rely upon inferring Kerberos or plain based on the

Thrift SASL transport doesn't detect if the other peer is not using the SASL transport ([THRIFT-1774|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/THRIFT-1774]). Hence if the hiveserver and client are not using the same transport then the connection simply hangs. Hence its using SASL transport as default and NOSASL is more of a backdoor if you are using some non-java bindings that doesn't have thrift sasl transport (and hence not listed in the hive-defaults).\n\nIMO making non-sasl as default will lead to more problems than what it intends to solve. For an end user , it doesn't matter what underlying authentication libraries are used for the implementation.

I agree with your comment regarding JDBC application explicitly adding \"nosasl\". In such case the application is doing a customization by overriding the default, so they should know what they are doing .. \nAlso you are correct about this details not being well documented. I will go ahead and add new advance/custom configuratoin sections to [Setting Up Hive Server|https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/adminmanual-settinguphiveserver.html] as well as [HiveServer2 Clients|https://cwiki.apache.org/Hive/hiveserver2-clients.html]. Thanks for bringing that out!\n\n[~cwsteinbach] Thanks for providing feedback.\nI would still like to argue that the \"PLAIN\" is more tied to the internal implementation and not indicative of the behavior, especially when its a default. We can perhaps change NOSASL to RAW or THRIFT, or leave it with the 'sasl' reference as its more of advance option.\nAnother thing to keep in mind that was available as a patch for HiveServer2 for a very long time. Even though its committed to trunk in 0.11, the community has started using the patch on top of Hive 0.10 as well as through multiple popular distros. Changing the configuration will be a backward incompatible change for such users. This one is not just flipping a config switch, but would also require changing JDBC code and recompiling/redeploying the application.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadm","name":"prasadm","key":"prasadm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Mujumdar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-04-04T19:32:20.863+0000","updated":"2013-04-04T19:32:20.863+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639051/comment/13622931","id":"13622931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdrome","name":"cdrome","key":"cdrome","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Drome","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I was thinking about this a little more and would like to summarize the current state:\n\nhive-site.xml -> transport -> JDBC connection string\n\n1. hive.server2.authentication=NOSASL -> raw transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname;auth=noSasl\n2. hive.server2.authentication=NONE -> plain SASL transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname   (*DEFAULT*)\n3. hive.server2.authentication=KERBEROS -> Kerberos SASL transport -> jdbc:hive2://host:port/dbname;principal=<principal>\n\nSo we need to set auth=noSasl to disable SASL instead of auth=plainsasl|kerberos to enable SASL.\n\nNow if the server is set to Kerberos, then the client still has to know this because it if they exclude the principal parameter it will happily initialize a plain SASL transport because the code infers SASL/Kerberos based on the existence of that value. Granted, in this case the connection throws an exception.\n\nIf it was a requirement to include say auth=plainsasl|kerberos in the connection string, then the code wouldn't have to guess what the intent was and could communicate an error if auth=kerberos and principal is not present.\n\nFurthermore, from what I can see, the plain SASL is really just a no-op as it is not doing anything when authentication=NONE.\n\nIn the end, it comes down to the fact that the client still needs to know the authentication method of the server.\nThat is why I asked whether we had data about the average use case. Do we know how often people are using raw vs plain vs kerberos?\n\nIt seems that the real issue is that a SASL transport doesn't play nicely with a raw transport. If it would be possible to remove the need to support the raw transport, that would resolve this discussion. Even the raw transport much speak thrift, so that isn't an issue. Rather it is a question of whether client should be forced to implement a SASL transport.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdrome","name":"cdrome","key":"cdrome","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Drome","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-04T23:01:57.325+0000","updated":"2013-04-04T23:01:57.325+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639051/comment/13625557","id":"13625557","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hello, [~cwsteinbach].
