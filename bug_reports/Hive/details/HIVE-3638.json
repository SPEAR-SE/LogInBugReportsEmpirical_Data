In the case of this particular test, Hive deviates from the SQL standard and outputs an empty result set instead of a NULL result set when an aggregate function is run on an empty table/partition. I believe MR2 generates splits even though the input directory in empty and Hive in turn outputs an empty result set. The behavior on MR1 used to be the same as MR2, until a recent change that went into HDFS. It would really help to see the failure you are seeing on hadoop23.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shreepadma","name":"shreepadma","key":"shreepadma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shreepadma Venugopalan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-10-30T00:39:20.035+0000","updated":"2012-10-30T00:39:20.035+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613948/comment/13486597","id":"13486597","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cdrome","name":"cdrome","key":"cdrome","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Drome","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"@Shreepadma: I had traced the code a while back and found that Hive was creating an empty file for these types of queries. Hadoop20 didn't care that the file was empty and would create a split, which would get a mapper. With Hadoop23 I noticed that there is a condition which checks to see whether the file is empty or not. If it is empty it doesn't create a split and hence doesn't get a mapper. In this way Hive could trick Hadoop20 into running an MR job, but this tactic doesn't work on Hadoop23. I don't remember the classes off-hand.\n\nHere is the diff of the generated vs expected output.

When no splits are generated Hive takes a different code path and a NULL is emitted from the closeOp() of the groupByOperator.
