I think this is more reasonable then having the query wait and generate its txn state after locks, because that makes the results of the query variable based on when locks are obtained instead of when it is submitted.\n\n(Note that this issue exists no matter what.  Even once locks are acquired it may take some time for the engine (Tez or MR) to submit the job.  Also, once we support cross query transactions we'll have multiple queries where we are acquiring new sets of locks.)\n\nIf the compactor runs between when the query gets its txn list and when it obtains locks we should still be fine.  By definition the compactor does not change the set of valid data.  Some txns listed as aborted in the query's list may now be removed from the file, but that's not a problem.\n\nHave I missed anything?\n\nbq.
