Attached “implicit join.hql” has several join keys (for example store_sales.ss_addr_sk = customer_address.ca_address_sk) and cannot be regonized by Hive. In such cases hive won’t be able to optimize and can only do a cross join first which makes the job runs really long. If I change the log to explicit join keys, then it works well.\n\nFor the below simple query hive can regcogonize the join keys, and I think Hive should be able to handle the complex situations such as my example, right?\n \nSELECT * \nFROM table1 t1, table2 t2, table3 t3 \nWHERE t1.id = t2.id AND t2.id = t3.id AND t1.zipcode = '02535';","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12778164","id":"12778164","filename":"explicit join key.hql","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxzxy1988","name":"zxzxy1988","key":"zxzxy1988","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyong Zhu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-17T02:31:48.871+0000","size":1873,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778164/explicit+join+key.hql"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12778165","id":"12778165","filename":"Implicit Joins.hql","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxzxy1988","name":"zxzxy1988","key":"zxzxy1988","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyong Zhu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-17T02:31:48.879+0000","size":2248,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778165/Implicit+Joins.hql"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12778166","id":"12778166","filename":"job explain plan.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxzxy1988","name":"zxzxy1988","key":"zxzxy1988","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyong Zhu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-17T02:31:48.887+0000","size":12042,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12778166/job+explain+plan.txt"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"complex join keys cannot be recognized in Hive 0.13","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxzxy1988","name":"zxzxy1988","key":"zxzxy1988","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyong Zhu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxzxy1988","name":"zxzxy1988","key":"zxzxy1988","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaoyong Zhu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-12700/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2q0hb:"}}
