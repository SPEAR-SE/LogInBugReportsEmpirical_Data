I think the idea makes good sense, but the description about MR is not correct. At least I wasn't able to make MR not use a single reducer for the query cited. You can rewrite the query though using a subquery to get the result you want.\n\nThere are two more flags to consider (when rewriting):\n\na) set hive.optimize.reducededuplication.min.reducer:\n\nIf this is set to 1 you will have a single reducer regardless of rewrite.\n\nb) hive.fetch.task.aggr\n\nIf this one is true the final count will happen on the client. This is more important in MR than Tez (because it would start a new job in MR, in tez it's just another stage in the DAG).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-03T23:09:47.357+0000","updated":"2014-02-03T23:09:47.357+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-6247/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1rm3j:"}}
