So, let me ask another question. I think failover is present in datanucleus  3.0 and Hive is still on 2.x. So, that may be the reason that Hive implemented its own failover. If this is correct, shall we first upgrade Datanucleus version to 3.x and then switch to Datanucleus functionality instead of our own retrials. If there is an agreement then patch on this ticket can be committed as is and I will open tickets for followup work.

The case that could be handled with the URL hook is as follows - a db host goes down. A failover is performed and a replica on a different host is promoted to be the new master. Using the hook, the client is able to re-execute the query on the new host and the Hive query succeeds without failure. Would it be possible to implement something similar in datanucleus 3.0?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pauly","name":"pauly","key":"pauly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-06-03T20:46:54.177+0000","updated":"2011-06-03T20:46:54.177+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500610/comment/13133723","id":"13133723","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"@Paul,\nFrom the url I quoted above:\nbq. DataNucleus has the capability to switch to between DataSources upon failure of one while obtaining a datastore connection. The failover mechanism is useful for applications with multiple database nodes when the data is actually replicated/synchronized by the underlying database.\nSo, DN will try to connect to a slave automatically when it can't connect with master. But it won't promote the slave to master so metastore can proceed with read only queries on DB. This falls short of what you have described, but once we upgrade to 3.x via HIVE-2084 we can atleast simplify the reconnect logic.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-23T20:19:19.453+0000","updated":"2011-10-23T20:19:19.453+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-2029/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0li2v:"}}
