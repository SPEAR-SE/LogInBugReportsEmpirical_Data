This has following advantages:\n* Client don't need to do any aggregation. After retrieving statistics from JobTracker (via JobClient) it can directly add them to metastore.\n* It lowers memory footprint on JobTracker, since instead of having counters per task per partition, it will have counters per partition only.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-02T22:51:37.660+0000","updated":"2013-12-02T23:04:45.781+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12682245/comment/13837095","id":"13837095","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Unfinished patch illustrating the idea.
