In that case we can either throw an error or \"guess\" what the user means.  My guess is that most other escaping logic will escape \"\\\" to \"\\ \\\" (if they escape something using \"\\\", they have to escape \"\\\" too). And they don't do special handling according to the actual separator (most of them escape all special characters). So if there is actually a \"\\ 0 0 5\", it is most likely be the ascii code 5.\n\n\nI am also OK if we just escape (and unescape reflectively) all characters outside the range of 32-127, plus \"\\\" and all separators.
