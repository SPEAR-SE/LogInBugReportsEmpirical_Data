When this field attribute is set, DynamicSerDeFieldList will call protocol.skip for that field.  \n2. We add an interface for protocols, something like: TFastSkippable { void skip(type); } or maybe need skipI32, skipi64, skipString, skipList, ... \n3. for TCTLSeparatedProtocol, we implement TFastSkippable\n4. Modify the runtime to insert skip attributes in the runtime DDL passed to DynamicSerDe.\n\nThis will need to be prioritized with other optimizations, but for TCTLSeparatedProtocol this is certainly a performance issue and may block replacing TMetadataTypedColumnsetSerDe with DynamicSerDe since the latter is only strings and cost of not skipping is low.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wyckoff","name":"wyckoff","key":"wyckoff","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pete Wyckoff","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-10-30T18:25:58.611+0000","updated":"2008-10-30T18:25:58.611+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12407541/comment/12669500","id":"12669500","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"A recent performance study from Rodrigo showed that creating new String objects for each column in each row is a big performance overhead.\nWe might want to do lazy initialization to get rid of the cost of creating new String objects (or use modified Text class).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-02-02T03:24:12.590+0000","updated":"2009-02-02T03:24:12.590+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-34/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0iv73:"}}
