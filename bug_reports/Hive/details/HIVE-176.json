It looks like there is one history per session - right? In which case - can you just put a hivehistory object as part of sessionstate? Sessionstate captures all the session specific stuff - and is maintained thread local. when a new sessionstate is created - the hivehistory can be created within it.\n\nalso - a little uncomfortable with the fixed /tmp setting for the history file. It would be good to have a new option in HiveConf for the history file directory. This would something that admins would want to tweak for the hive server deployments (hadoop has a similar one) and users would want to tweak to get all their history files in a standard location.

Also - the init() call and HiveHistory.get() both call setHistory on sessionstate. i am actually unsure of why there is a HiveHistory.get() call in the first place. seems like all u have to do is initialize the history object and store it in the sessionstate - both of which can be done by SessionState.getHiveHistory(). probably u don't need a setHiveHistory() function in SessionState as well.\nDriver.java: should move up the TASK_NAME setting up into the startTask code since it seems to me that having the task name would be good for building any kind of UI stuff on top of this query log.\n\nDriver.java:  setJobProperty(command, Keys.TASK_NUM_REDUCE_TASKS, String.valueOf(hasReduce)); - confused by this - this is a task property - right? (ExecDriver sets it as well). HAS_REDUCE_TASKS is questionable from point of view of history (not sure why it's relevant).
