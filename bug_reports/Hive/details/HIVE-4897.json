The tokens can be stored in MS memory and are unique (an incrementing number), they are GCed after a long period (an hour?). For generality, each operation with the token could have a client-maintained per-operation sequence number that is not incremented on retries; to start, just one expected operation per token could be permitted - e.g. createSomething. Success (or error) would be recorded with the token in MS.\nIf a retry comes with the same token(+seq num in case of multiple ops), it would be a no-op, or the original error would be re-thrown.\nComparing objects as originally suggested is both difficult and error-prone, and also not bullet-proof if someone alters the objects in the interim.\n\nThis approach is hard to use for ops that return result because it's not clear what result is to be returned, unless the result of original operation is saved, which is a PITA. We can either throw a special exception (succeeded, but cannot return the result), or return the latest state of the object for some ops; create* do not return any result so we are good here.\nTokens can be stored externally for failover, but I don't think this is really necessary for the first draft.\n\nFor the first draft in-memory, single-operation tokens with no result option would be easy to implement. Oh yeah, it will be configurable, of course :) On by default. [~thejas] should we do that? Opinions?
