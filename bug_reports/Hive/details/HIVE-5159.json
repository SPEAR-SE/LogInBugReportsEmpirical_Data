In this situation the Kind value is set as NULL.  Is the point of setting Kind as optional field of Type so that you would have the ability to call hasKind() on the Type and do appropriate error handling? Looking at OrcProto.java it appears that there is such a Type.hasKind() method already, so this use case is already covered. Or is there another use case that you are thinking of here?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-30T20:42:49.327+0000","updated":"2013-08-30T20:42:49.327+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-5159/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1nm93:"}}
