killed(http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=4770092), but I guess there should be some fixes, I will dig more.\nThe following excellent SDN comment explains what's going on:\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nThe fundamental problem here is that, unlike Unix, Windows does that\nmaintain parent-child relationships between processes. A process can\nkill its own immediate children, but unless you make other\narrangements to obtain the information, can't kill any\n'grand-children' because it has no way of finding them. Ctrl-C types\nat a command prompt is just a character that the command processor\ninterprets and not a signal sent from outside. When you 'destroy' a\nchild command script, that process does not get the opportunity to\nterminate any child processes it may know about.\nRecent versions of WIndows (2000 or later) do provide a \"Job\" concept\nwhich acts as a container for processes. Killing a Job does terminate\nall processes associated with that job. However Jobs do not contain\nother jobs, so fully emulating the Unix behaviour is probably\nimpossible.\n---------------------------------------------------------------------\nNote that Unix emulation environments on Windows, like Cygwin,\nsuffer from the same problem. Any fix would be difficult.\nEven if we could figure out how to fix this, we might choose not to do so\nfor the usual reason – compatibility.\n2005-09-27","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaobingo","name":"xiaobingo","key":"xiaobingo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaobing Zhou","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-03T18:19:02.207+0000","updated":"2014-10-03T18:19:02.207+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745780/comment/14158286","id":"14158286","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xiaobingo","name":"xiaobingo","key":"xiaobingo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xiaobing Zhou","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Removed cmd.exe process as a wrapper of JVM process.
