In hive 0.8.0 the HiveStatement.java class seems to have executeQuery method, not executeSQL. (./hive/jdbc/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/hive/jdbc/HiveStatement.java)\n\nAnyway, the toString() method of the Exception - which is actually inherited from Throwable class - returns the name of the object and the message, as the result of the getMessage() method, concatenated by a colon. Thus when the  SQLException is rethrown from the second catch block, the SQLException will have the original message and also the SQLState string value- \"08S01\".\n\nSee for instance, a simple code to demonstrate it:\n\nimport java.sql.SQLException;\nimport java.io.FileReader;\n\npublic class Exc {\n    public static void main(String[] args) {\n        try {\n           ThrowException();\n        }\n       catch (SQLException ex) {\n          System.out.println(\"String: \" + ex.toString());\n          System.out.println(\"State: \" + ex.getSQLState());\n          System.out.println(\"Message: \" + ex.getMessage());\n          System.exit(1);\n       }\n    }\n\n    public static void ThrowException() throws SQLException {\n       try {\n          FileReader fr = new FileReader(\"test.txt\");    \n       }\n       catch (Exception ex) {\n          System.out.println(\"FileReader exception caught: \" + ex.toString());\n          throw new SQLException(ex.toString(), \"08S01\");\n       }\n    }\n}\n\n\nThe output of this code is as follows (the original FileNotFoundException is returned by the rethrown exception and the SQLState can be retrieved, too):\n\nFileReader exception caught: java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (No such file or directory)\nString: java.sql.SQLException: java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (No such file or directory)\nState: 08S01\nMessage: java.io.FileNotFoundException: test.txt (No such file or directory)\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szegedi","name":"szegedi","key":"szegedi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Istvan Szegedi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-12-27T18:49:08.685+0000","updated":"2011-12-27T18:49:08.685+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-2675/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ll3j:"}}
