I believe that the proposed patch isn't in accordance with the standard though. I might have misinterpreted it - happy to be corrected.\n\nFrom what I remember:\n\n- Precision is always implementation specific\n- Scale is *only* implementation specific for division\n\nIf an exact numeric value cannot be represented without rounding (in mult/add/sub) you're supposed to raise an error. I didn't do that because that seems bad in hive, so I returned \"null\" from the operation. Rounding implicitly for mult/add/sub seems to sort of defeat the purpose of having an exact numeric type.\n\nFor division you can round or truncate but not loose any leading significant digits.\n\n(side note: div by zero is also supposed to error out, but in hive it returns null)\n\nSo, one way to fix this problem would be to more aggressively round or truncate division. That way you will have more \"room\" for subsequent operations. Better yet, with HIVE-3976 we could have a default that's much smaller than the max and just round to the current scale of the dividend. This won't resolve this problem, but make it much less likely to occur.\n\nI also think that [~jdere] makes a good point. If we change the behavior in a non backwards compatible way, it would be really great to do that only once (i.e.: have HIVE-5022 and HIVE-3976 in the same release). In the meantime the \"round manually\" workaround should help.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-30T03:26:03.663+0000","updated":"2013-08-30T03:26:03.663+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12662506/comment/13754950","id":"13754950","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jdere","name":"jdere","key":"jdere","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Dere","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"There's the actual SQL reference rules regarding exact precision arithmetic (6.12 if you're looking at SQL92, and it looks like later references look the same):\n\n         1) If the data type of both operands of a dyadic arithmetic opera-\n            tor is exact numeric, then the data type of the result is exact\n            numeric, with precision and scale determined as follows:\n\n            a) Let S1 and S2 be the scale of the first and second operands\n              respectively.\n\n            b) The precision of the result of addition and subtraction is\n              implementation-defined, and the scale is the maximum of S1\n              and S2.\n\n            c) The precision of the result of multiplication is implementation-\n              defined, and the scale is S1 + S2.\n\n            d) The precision and scale of the result of division is\n              implementation-defined.\n\n\nI'd agree with what hagleitn said about the resulting precision/scale of division operations, Hive is allowed to define what precision/scale it returns on division, and it probably should not be allowed to take up the entire precision.
