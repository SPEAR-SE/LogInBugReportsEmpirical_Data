as they are not being referenced from anywhere else. Maybe we don't even need those variables, as they are just used once within the functions. Thats easier to read.\n * \"a call to tryLock() will immediately acquire the lock if it is available, whether or not other threads are currently waiting for the lock. \" https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html#tryLock(). Looks like  tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) is the better call to make\n * Use SessionState.getConsole().logInfo instead of ol.writeOperationLog. I see that ol.writeOperationLog is being used at few other places, that should be cleaned up. SessionState.getConsole().* methods are used in almost all places for information . We can cleanup the usage of ol.writeOperationLog in a separate patch.\n *   LOG.debug(waitingForLockMsg + \": \" + command)  can be removed once SessionState.getConsole().logInfo is used. It will print to the HS2 log as well.\n * If the 'waiting for lock' is printed, its useful to also have the 'acquired lock' message printed. How about replacing  LOG.debug(lockAcquiredMsg); with SessionState.getConsole().logInfo(lockAcquiredMsg) ?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-22T06:46:18.961+0000","updated":"2016-07-22T06:46:18.961+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990243/comment/15389812","id":"15389812","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=taoli-hwx","name":"taoli-hwx","key":"taoli-hwx","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tao Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for your comments [~thejas].\n\nRegarding #2, according to [doc|https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/locks/ReentrantLock.html#tryLock()] about tryLock, \"If you want to honor the fairness setting for this lock, then use tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) which is almost equivalent (it also detects interruption).\" The only difference between tryLock() and tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) is that the latter throws a InterruptionException. I don't think we really need to use tryLock(0, TimeUnit.SECONDS) except there is a convention there.\n\nRegarding #5, I intentionally left out the \"lock acquired\" message to minimize the number of rows of messages before displaying the query result, since I think that's a little bit intrusive to the users. The original purpose of this change is to indicate the waiting status to the end users when the compilation task is waiting for the lock. So as long as we print out the waiting message, it should satisfy that purpose. In normal cases the query result should be displayed after lock is acquired, so I don't think the \"lock acquired\" message is really useful/necessary for the beeline users.\n\nI will make changes based on other comments. They are good points.
