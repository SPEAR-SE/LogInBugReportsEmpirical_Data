We should simply throw an exception during the parse stage if there is any ambiguity in which table is which, just like we do if the column names are ambiguous.\n\nOr, if for some reason we need people to be able to use 'a' to refer to multiple tables or subqueries, it would be excellent if the exact parsing structure were made clear and added to the wiki.
