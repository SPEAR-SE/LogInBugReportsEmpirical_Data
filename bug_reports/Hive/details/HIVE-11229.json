Although this does not happen in practice (see HIVE-11228), the API does communicate with the meta store in this manner to obtain partition paths and create new partitions. Therefore the issue described does in fact exist in the current implementation, albeit in a different code path. Iâ€™d like to make such communication optional like so:\n\n* When the user chooses not to create partitions on demand, no meta store connection will be created in the {{MutationCoordinators}}. Additionally, partition paths will be resolved using {{org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.Warehouse.getPartitionPath(Path, LinkedHashMap<String, String>)}} which should be suitable so long as standard Hive partition layouts are followed.\n* If the user does choose to create partitions on demand then the system will operate as is does currently; using the meta store to both issue {{add_partition}} events and look up partition meta data.\n* The documentation will be updated to describe these behaviours and outline alternative approaches to collecting affected partition names and creating partitions in a less intensive manner.\n\nSide note for follow up: The parameter names {{tblName}} and {{dbName}} seem to be the wrong way around on the method {{org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.IMetaStoreClient.getPartition(String, String, List<String>)}}.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12744722","id":"12744722","filename":"HIVE-11229.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2015-07-10T14:41:24.909+0000","size":36979,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12744722/HIVE-11229.1.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Mutation API: Coordinator communication with meta store should be optional","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10430","value":"Patch","id":"10430"}],"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12844183/comment/14622393","id":"14622393","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Attached patch [^HIVE-11229.1.patch] that provides the user with an option to use {{MutationCoordinators}} in a manner that does not require a meta store connection.
