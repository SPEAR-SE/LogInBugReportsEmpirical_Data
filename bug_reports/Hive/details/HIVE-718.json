If the renamer crashes in the middle of the operation, the files will have been moved out of the original location and into the tmpdir, but the tmpdir has not been renamed into the destination. Is this OK? I feel like the solution would be to make dstdir/_staging_<timestamp>, move the files one-by-one into there, and then rename _staging_<timestamp> to the destination.

It caught my attention as Todd brought up whether we should get this into 0.4.0 release as this is a regression when compared to 0.3.0. I checked the code on 0.3.0 and it seems to be the same as that in 0.4.0. So I am not sure if this is a regression. If this is not a regression then potentially we can go out with 0.4.0 without this and document this?\n\nAs is evident by this discussion LOAD INTO and its cousin INSERT INTO (when we have it) are very tricky. Almost all our code has been written with the overwrite semantics. Appending new data to an existing partition would need more work to get right and I feel we should punt it and document that insert into is not reliable - I think it has never been reliable.\n\nIn order to safely implement the INSERT INTO and LOAD INTO semantics one approach is to introduce a notion of versions on the DML commands which is encoded in the directory structure i.e.\n\ninstead of storing things as \n\nxyz/part-0000\n\nwe store the files as\n\nxyz/v1/part-0000\n\nand so on so forth. We store the latest created version in the metastore entry for that table. When a reader comes in it first looks at this entry and then finds a version corresponding to that in the table. The versions themselves could be garbage collected by deleting version directories that are older than say some configurable duration old and this could either be done lazily by the writer on the table or by an active garbage collector in the background. These are of course somewhat involved changes and would solve the isolation and atomicity problems. The later becase v1 is a directory so moving data to that directory would be a rename and hence atomic.

Given this, I think we may need to avoid depending on HDFS for atomicity or locking.\n\nThere was another discussion on hive-users@ about providing some kind of locking so that two different jobs can do conflicting things to a directory (if there is one writer and a reader). So if we go down that route, this problem can be solved by acquiring write locks (or leases). Ofcourse, this won't work if one of the processes is a non-Hive process. Even ashish's solution will not work since the external process needs to handle the version numbers correctly.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadc","name":"prasadc","key":"prasadc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Chakka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-09-11T21:03:54.523+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T21:03:54.523+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432077/comment/12754384","id":"12754384","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"@Todd, I dont think it is a regression, and there is no easy fix for this.\n\nDo you think we should hold the release for this ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-09-11T22:25:05.456+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T22:25:05.456+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432077/comment/12754397","id":"12754397","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@prasad, can you explain your comment about the external process stuff?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-09-11T22:47:06.454+0000","updated":"2009-09-11T22:47:06.454+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432077/comment/12754402","id":"12754402","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prasadc","name":"prasadc","key":"prasadc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prasad Chakka","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"It is possible for users now to add new files to the table/partition directory without going through Hive to load files.
