For a specified last_value() OVER X. The ordering spec within X is used in addition to the partition spec for partitioning. i.e. last_value(a) OVER (PARTITION BY i ORDER BY j) operates last_value(a) on all rows within the unique combination of (i,j). The behavior I'd expect is for PARTITION BY i to define the partitioning, and ORDER BY to define the ordering within the PARTITION. i.e. last_value(a) OVER (PARTITION BY i ORDER BY j) should operate last_value(a) on all rows within the unique values of (i), ordered by j within the partition. \n\nThis was changed to be consistent with how SQLServer handled such queries. [SQLServer Docs|https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh231517.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396] describe their example (which performs as Hive does): \n\n{quote}\nThe PARTITION BY clause partitions the employees by department and the LAST_VALUE function is applied to each partition independently. The ORDER BY clause specified in the OVER clause determines the logical order in which the LAST_VALUE function is applied to the rows in each partition.\n{quote}\n\nTo me, their behavior is inconsistent with their description. I've filled an [upstream bug|https://connect.microsoft.com/SQLServer/feedback/details/1753482] with Microsoft for the same. \n\n[Oracle|https://oracle-base.com/articles/misc/first-value-and-last-value-analytic-functions] and [Redshift|http://docs.aws.amazon.com/redshift/latest/dg/r_Examples_of_firstlast_WF.html] both exhibit the behavior I'd expect.\n\nConsidering Hive-4262 has been in core for 2+ years, I don't think we can change the behavior without potentially impacting clients. But I would like a way to enable the expected behavior at the least (behind a config flag maybe?).
