Should probably remove it.\n\nI could not get rid of ant package since there was no way for me to directly call ant install-hadoopcore in trunk/build.xml. That would require us to refactor build-common.xml and other */build.xml files which is a bigger change.\n\nWill add the comment back to getDatabases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rsm","name":"rsm","key":"rsm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Raghotham Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-12-31T18:48:52.125+0000","updated":"2008-12-31T18:48:52.125+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12411510/comment/12660763","id":"12660763","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I was able to import the project using this patch (this is very useful), however I got the following errors:\n\n1.
