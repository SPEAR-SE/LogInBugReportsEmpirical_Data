way, but I'm not certain if I will tread on any toes if I change that, since this has been public interface for a while - also, I'm not certain if expecting \"null\" from getPartitions might be used in any code to determine if this is a List<Partition> based or PartitionSpec-based AddPartitionEvent. So, I've not messed with the current implementation of getPartitions. That said, [~mithun], could you please comment if you're okay with me fixing getPartitions so that it doesn't return null in the case where it has been instantiated from a PartitionSpec? I could at the very least do that.\n\nAlso, to handle the base problem, we should fix AddPartitionEvent.getPartitionIterator to correctly work in correctly in both cases - this should at least not be controversial.\n\nAfter that, we should change MessageFactory.buildAddPartitionMessage to work on Iterator<Partition> rather than List<Partition> - this is trivially fixable, and have JSONMessageFactory use that instead, thereby solving our initial problem of getPartitions call from AddPartitionEvent not being usable in cases of events fired with PartitionSpec rather than List<Partition>","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-08T03:55:39.067+0000","updated":"2015-02-08T03:55:39.067+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12773267/comment/14311097","id":"14311097","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch attached.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-08T03:57:15.341+0000","updated":"2015-02-08T03:57:15.341+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12773267/comment/14311130","id":"14311130","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\n{color:red}Overall{color}: -1 no tests executed\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12697307/HIVE-9609.patch\n\nTest results: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/2706/testReport\nConsole output: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/2706/console\nTest logs: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-2706/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nTests exited with: ExecutionException: org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ssh.SSHExecutionException: RSyncResult [localFile=/data/hive-ptest/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-2706/succeeded/TestHBaseMinimrCliDriver, remoteFile=/home/hiveptest/54.196.66.93-hiveptest-0/logs/, getExitCode()=12, getException()=null, getUser()=hiveptest, getHost()=54.196.66.93, getInstance()=0]: 'Address 54.196.66.93 maps to ec2-54-196-66-93.compute-1.amazonaws.com, but this does not map back to the address -
