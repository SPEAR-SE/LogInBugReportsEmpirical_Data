For example, HIVE-12049 is adding new tests in same class.\n\nI think we should revert the optimization inn HIVE-13149 temporarily because of the test case breakage and possible other production issues it might bring about (as we haven't really nailed down the interaction). We can bring it back after the changes you are making to make things thread safe (or other fixes to get the test working).\nDoes that sound OK ?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-15T07:32:24.238+0000","updated":"2016-04-15T07:32:24.238+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12958393/comment/15242972","id":"15242972","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aihuaxu","name":"aihuaxu","key":"aihuaxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aihua Xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yeah.
