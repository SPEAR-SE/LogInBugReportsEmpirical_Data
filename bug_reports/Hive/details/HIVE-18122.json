However, the existence of partition columns for a non-native table is problematic when using {{HCatInputFormat}}. Nothing disallows the table creation, and the documentation [1] does not mention that non-native tables cannot have partition columns. In fact, it suggests that \"PARTITIONED BY\" can be specified.\r\n\r\nWith such a table definition, for any job using {{HCatInputFormat}} no data can ever be read and the cause is not immediately obvious, only revealed via debugging. The bug stems from the {{org.apache.hive.hcatalog.mapreduce.InitializeInput}} class's logic in the {{getInputJobInfo}} method, where it attempts to identify the partitions to read. With partition columns defined, {{table.getPartitionKeys().size()}} is > 0 so it proceeds to the {{listPartitionsByFilter(...)}} code which will never find any partitions, because partitions cannot be added to a non-native table (HIVE-1223). The returned {{InputJobInfo}} then has an empty {{List<PartInfo>}} set rather than taking the \"Non partitioned table\" path where the table's {{StorageDescriptor}} and parameters are used to build a singleton {{PartInfo}} to use.\r\n\r\nThis bug is quite similar to HIVE-18087 although it resides in a different layer of Hive.\r\n\r\nWe encountered this using the {{HBaseStorageHandler}}, although I don't believe that's a particularly relevant detail.\r\n\r\n[1] https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/Hive/StorageHandlers#StorageHandlers-DDL","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HCatInputFormat cannot read any data when non-native table has partition columns","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noslowerdna","name":"noslowerdna","key":"noslowerdna","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Olson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noslowerdna","name":"noslowerdna","key":"noslowerdna","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Olson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13120069/comment/16261578","id":"16261578","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noslowerdna","name":"noslowerdna","key":"noslowerdna","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Olson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Until non-native tables officially support being created with \"PARTITIONED BY\", changing the InitializeInput line:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nif (table.getPartitionKeys().size() != 0) {\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nto:\r\n\r\n{noformat}\r\nif (!table.isNonNative() && table.getPartitionKeys().size() != 0) {\r\n{noformat}\r\n\r\nseems like a reasonable solution.
