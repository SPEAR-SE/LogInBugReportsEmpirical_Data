Are you using sql standard authorization in this case or another custom V2 authorization implementation ? Would it work to move the logic from your custom filter hook to HiveAuthorizer.filterListCmdObjects implementation ?\n{quote}\nYes, I'm using {{another custom V2 authorization implementation}}, I think it's good suggestion to move the logic to HiveAuthorizer.filterListCmdObjects implementation. \nHi [~Ferd]\n{quote}\n I think it's not a good practice to override METASTORE_FILTER_HOOK by hard code. In a conservative way, we may provide the user a warning in the log or description to warn this property is overrided in the run time. \n{quote}\nThis is a good suggestion, I'm agreed with you. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dapengsun","name":"dapengsun","key":"dapengsun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dapeng Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-07-08T06:38:09.042+0000","updated":"2015-07-08T06:38:09.042+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843102/comment/14618073","id":"14618073","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dapengsun","name":"dapengsun","key":"dapengsun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dapeng Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi [~thejas], if you are also agreed with [~Ferd], I would rename the title of jira and work on the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dapengsun","name":"dapengsun","key":"dapengsun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dapeng Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-07-08T06:41:16.538+0000","updated":"2015-07-08T06:41:16.538+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12843102/comment/14618184","id":"14618184","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dapengsun","name":"dapengsun","key":"dapengsun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dapeng Sun","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi [~thejas]\nAbout {{AuthorizationMetaStoreFilterHook}}, I found {{commandString}} didn't set to HiveAuthzContext.
