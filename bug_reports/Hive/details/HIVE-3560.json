Make sure to provide a valid value for hive.metastore.uris if you are connecting to a remote metastore.\n{code}\n\nThe reason is {{javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL}} has a default value and will never be null. I set this property in {{hive-site.xml}} and walked through the configuration loading in a debugger. If the value is not empty it takes effect, and is ignored if empty.\n\nSince {{javax.jdo.option.ConnectionURL}} has a default and cannot be unset, this warning will always be printed if someone sets {{hive.metastore.uris}}.\n\nPer the review comments, the error message was added to reduce user confusion, and prevent surprises by using the wrong metastore (either embedded or remote). In {{HiveMetaStoreClient.java}} we see a very clear info message printed saying that a remote metastore is used.\n\n{code}\nLOG.info(\"Trying to connect to metastore with URI \" + store);\n...\nLOG.info(\"Connected to metastore.\");\n{code}\n\nSince we clearly communicate to the user that a remote metastore at the given URI is being used we'll remove that message. Additionally, to further clarify a remote metastore is used I'll make the following HiveMetaStoreClient logging change:\n\n{code}\nLOG.debug(\"Trying to connect to remote HiveMetaStore: \" + store);\n...\nLOG.info(\"Connected to remote HiveMetaStore: \" + store);\n{code}\n\nThe change is at debug level we print connection attempts, and always print which remote HiveMetaStore we actually connected
