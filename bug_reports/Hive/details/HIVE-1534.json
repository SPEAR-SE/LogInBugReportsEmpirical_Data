I will go through semi join and its expected output with filters. Will update the patch if any changes are needed and add tests.\n\nbq. Why did you add a genExprNode() ? Cant you re-use the one from SemanticAnalyzer ?\ngenExprNode() in SemanticAnalyzer is not a static method. It uses unparseTranslator while generating. Will change genExprNode() in SemanticAnalyzer to use the new static method introduced and remove duplicate code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-09-15T06:02:49.936+0000","updated":"2010-09-15T06:02:49.936+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471377/comment/12910503","id":"12910503","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.
