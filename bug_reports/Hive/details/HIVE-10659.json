The commands executed via beeline can include stored procedures. For e.g. the following command used to create a stored procedure is a valid command :\n\n{code}\nCREATE PROCEDURE RM_TLBS_LINKID() BEGIN IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`COLUMNS` WHERE `TABLE_NAME` = 'TBLS' AND `COLUMN_NAME` = 'LINK_TARGET_ID') THEN ALTER TABLE `TBLS` DROP FOREIGN KEY `TBLS_FK3` ; ALTER TABLE `TBLS` DROP KEY `TBLS_N51` ; ALTER TABLE `TBLS` DROP COLUMN `LINK_TARGET_ID` ; END IF; END\n{code}\n\nMySQL stored procedures have semi-colon ( ; ) as the statement terminator. Since this coincides with beeline's only available command terminator, semi-colon, beeline will not able to execute the above command successfully . i.e, beeline tries to execute the below partial command instead of the complete command shown above.\n\n{code}\nCREATE PROCEDURE RM_TLBS_LINKID() BEGIN IF EXISTS (SELECT * FROM `INFORMATION_SCHEMA`.`COLUMNS` WHERE `TABLE_NAME` = 'TBLS' AND `COLUMN_NAME` = 'LINK_TARGET_ID') THEN ALTER TABLE `TBLS` DROP FOREIGN KEY `TBLS_FK3` ; \n{code} \n\nThe above situation can actually happen within Hive when Hive SchemaTool is used to upgrade a mysql metastore db and the scripts used for the upgrade process contain stored procedures(as the one introduced initially by HIVE-7018). As of now, we cannot have any stored procedure as part of MySQL metastore db upgrade scripts because schemaTool uses beeline to connect to MySQL. As of now, beeline fails to execute any \"create procedure\" command or similar command containing ; . This is a serious limitation; it needs to be fixed by allowing the end user to provide an option to beeline to not use  semi-colon as the command delimiter and instead use new line character as the command delimiter.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12731639","id":"12731639","filename":"HIVE-10659.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-08T22:43:26.831+0000","size":4643,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12731639/HIVE-10659.1.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Beeline command which contains semi-colon as a non-command terminator will fail","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828488/comment/14535795","id":"14535795","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"cc-ing [~thejas] / [~sushanth] for review.

Sorry for the misleading title here; my bad, I should have mentioned that this fix proposed here is intended to fix the delimiter issue only when beeline is accessed via schematool. I.e, this change is internal and is used only by the hive schematool and need not be documented. For the general solution to the issue mentioned in the jira, i.e. for beeline to support this feature we need to introduce a command similar to DELIMITER used in MySQL client.
