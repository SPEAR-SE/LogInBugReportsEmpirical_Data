(bin and src are already available)\n\nBUT, beeline which is included to apache-hive-1.2.0-bin.tar.gz is also jdbc client. It needs hive-jdbc-standalone.jar to open jdbc connection to Hiveserver2.\nbeeline.sh location is bin/ext/beeline.sh   so it has \"ext\" in path\nThis is why beeline specific jars should also have \"ext\" in path\nThis is why I put hive-jdbc-standalone.jar to extlib folder.\nWe can use another folder for hive-jdbc-standalone.jar but it should not be mixed with hive/lib jars. \nWhy have class duplicates in hive classpath and non-determenistic java classpath behaviours. Who knows from what jar particular class is loaded.\n\nThe only purpose of having hive-jdbc-standalone.jar in apache-hive-1.2.0-bin.tar.gz is beeline requirements to have it in classpath.\nLets put hive-jdbc-standalone.jar to beeline lib specific folder (or more generic jdbc-lib folder)\n\nAll other client application (like SQuirrel SQL, SQL Workbench/J, Tableau, etc) should get apache-hive-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT-jdbc.jar from Hive Download website.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=apivovarov","name":"apivovarov","key":"apivovarov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851"},"displayName":"Alexander Pivovarov","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-04T00:05:09.998+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T00:05:09.998+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770696/comment/14304716","id":"14304716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=apivovarov","name":"apivovarov","key":"apivovarov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=apivovarov&avatarId=25851"},"displayName":"Alexander Pivovarov","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"patch #2 -

Thanks, such suggestions really help improve hive!\n\n * I agree that it makes sense to publish the jdbc-standalone jar as something that can be downloaded without having to download the entire tar.gz. Most end users (who are not hadoop admins) would just need that, not the entire tar.gz. We should probably have discussion about that in the hive-dev mailing list, just to make sure everyone thinks the same. Would you like to start one ?\n * As we have been putting the standalone jar in the lib dir, people might be expecting the jar there, even after they upgrade their version of hive. So changing the jar location is a backward incompatibility issue in that regard (though not a major issue). Lets avoid that change unless there is a very strong reason to do it. I agree with you that we should have put it in a different dir in the first place.\n\nThanks again for the patch!\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-04T19:00:07.906+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T19:00:07.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770696/comment/14309744","id":"14309744","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch committed to trunk.
