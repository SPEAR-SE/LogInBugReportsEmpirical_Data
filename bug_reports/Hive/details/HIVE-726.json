The versions in the ivy.xml there were picked as the most recent versions, but as Ashish said, we could use the .0 releases instead - it's somewhat arbitrary. After the shims have been built with each of the hadoop versions, it makes a hive_shims.jar which includes *all* of the implementations.\n\nAt this point, when Hadoop is built, it can be built against any version of Hadoop using the -Dhadoop.version flag. In actuality this should not matter - it may be that there is still some work yet to be done, but in my testing I build with the default hadoop.version (0.19.0) and then ran the build products against 18 and 20 with no recompile. The ShimLoader class determines the current hadoop version at runtime and loads the correct implementation class out of hive_shims.jar.\n\nSo, -1 on the patch, since it would result in a hive_shims.jar that only includes one version of the shims, and thus the build product would only work on that version of Hadoop.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-08-05T21:27:39.978+0000","updated":"2009-08-05T21:27:39.978+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432308/comment/12739825","id":"12739825","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"HIVE-726.3.patch: This patch is even simpler. just add the hadoop.version that user specified for ivy to download.\nshims will be compiled as it was, but other parts of hive will be compiled against the version that the user specifies.\nI've verified all the following command runs fine:\n{code}\nant -Dhadoop.version=0.17.0 clean package\nant -Dhadoop.version=0.17.2.1 clean package\nant -Dhadoop.version=0.19.0 clean package\nant -Dhadoop.version=0.20.0 clean package\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-05T23:37:45.756+0000","updated":"2009-08-05T23:37:45.756+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432308/comment/12739850","id":"12739850","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I think there was still an issue which you've uncovered. ant's semantics for the <param> element inside <antcall> are somewhat screwy - you can't override something that has been passed on the command line. Since you guys were passing hadoop.version on the command line, it was actually compiling the shims for 17 four times rather than compiling each version, as best I can tell.\n\nAttaching a patch which gets around this by introducing a new ant property called \"hadoop.version.ant-internal\". This property is set in build.properties to default to hadoop.version, and hadoop.version is left as is. Everywhere in the build files that used to reference hadoop.version now references hadoop.version.ant-internal. Since we're not specifying this on the command line, the <antcall>s inside shims/build.xml can properly override it.\n\nOne question: I think the condition in build.xml's eclipsefiles targets that defaults to 0.19 is now dead code, since the property itself is defaulted to 0.19.0.\n\nAlso, can we change ${final.name} to simply ${name}-${version} since one build can work with any hadoop?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-08-06T00:57:34.096+0000","updated":"2009-08-06T00:57:34.096+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432308/comment/12750110","id":"12750110","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think we need this for 0.4 release","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-09-01T21:30:01.863+0000","updated":"2009-09-01T21:30:01.863+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12432308/comment/12750830","id":"12750830","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Todd, when I opened this issue I didn't know the way shims work (as you commented above).\n\nWhen I first saw that, it didn't work for me -
