[~madhan.neethiraj], one of the reviewers of that patch observed that this could lead to following two potential usability issues:\n# In Ranger a user's access privileges can be specified using wildcards. Say, a user in finance department has been given create privileges at the database level for any table that starts with fin, i.e. {{fin*}}. If such a user attempts to import a table named, say, {{fintemp}} then that operation would fail since we currently require database level privilege.\n# Ranger audits various user actions. Since table name isn't specified we can't record which table was got created. In some cases this could be inferred from the command string passed that is into the {{checkPrivilages}} (which we store off in our audit). However, when {{IMPORT}} does not specify the table name then in that case that information may not be readily available to user.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aloklal99","name":"aloklal99","key":"aloklal99","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alok Lal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-12-08T17:57:37.571+0000","updated":"2015-12-08T17:57:37.571+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12901364/comment/15049092","id":"15049092","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~aloklal99], that's a good point.
