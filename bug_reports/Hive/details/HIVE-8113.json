Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Actually, I was thinking about this further, and as I was getting ready to commit this patch, I saw this comment in metastore/pom.xml:\n\n{noformat}\n<!-- XXX we probably shouldn't be shipping this but the tests depend on it -->\n<dependency>\n  <groupId>org.apache.derby</groupId>\n  <artifactId>derby</artifactId>\n  <version>${derby.version}</version>\n</dependency>\n{noformat}\n\nand that made me wonder why we use that dependency in that pom.xml without specifying scope as test, and that made me think again about including derbynet also as a core dependency, which I don't think we should. I think the way to proceed ahead with this would be to do the following:\n\na) Create a new profile (maybe called \"windows\" ?). There already seems to be a profile called windows-test (maybe combine with that?)\nb) Add the derbynet dependency in as a dependency only if that profile is active, and add it in a packaging scope, not in compile or test. Adding it in the compile scope will guarantee that it's available in lib/, but the problem with that is that we'll pass on those additional dependencies to any other modules that want to include this even as a compile-time dependency.\nc) Additionally, we should probably change that derby dependency to be limited to test scope as well.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth
