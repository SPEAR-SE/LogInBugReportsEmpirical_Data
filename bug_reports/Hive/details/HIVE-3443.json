If its not Hive's responsibility to support non-ASF code such as Haivvreo, then Haivvreo specific property such as schema.url shouldn't be past of the metastore in the first place. Given that it is and users need a way to migrate to HA, there is not a better and a convenient way to do this migration other than make Metatool flexible enough to take in serdeParamKey from the user. This change is fixing what you are specifically objecting to i.e., Hive shouldn't know about Haivvreo.
