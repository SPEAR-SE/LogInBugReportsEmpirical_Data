then gets an instance with that conf, or if someone already happened to call (1) or (2) from this thread, it returns the existing instance with whatever conf was set before (but still resets the current conf to new conf).\n\nThis doesn't make sense even in an already-thread-safe case (like linear CLI-based tests), and can easily lead to bugs as described; the config propagation logic is not good (example - HIVE-12167); some calls just reset config blindly, so there's no point in setting staticConf, other than for the callers of method (1) above who don't have a conf and would rely on the static (which is bad design).\nHaving connections with different configs reliably in not possible, and multi-threaded cases would also break - you could even set conf, have it reset and get instance

HBaseStore and HBaseReadWrite\n* Each instance needs a copy of the config file, but they should all have the same copy.  Thus the attempt to set it up front with a static call.\n* Not all places that need an instance of HBaseReadWrite will have a reference on hand nor will they have the proper config file.  Thus they need to be able to get the instance without the config file, and they need to get the right instance for the thread they are running in.  Hence the calls to getInstance with no config and the reference being threadlocal.\n\n So first, a question.  Why are we seeing different threads have different config files?  I certainly didn't expect that.  Is there a valid reason for it?\n\nI've attached a proposed patch that deals with this by moving getInstance(conf) to setConf(conf) and only having getInstance().

For the test, it appears that the different configs might have been caused by the issue fixed in HIVE-12062, where config in testing util is reset after HBase minicluster config is set, so all subsequent code uses a different config.\nAnother scenario is for embedded metastore usage for any service that gets different configs, like Tez AM. Tez AM should not rely on default config to create metastore and should instead rely on config of the query; I had problems with that before due to some static call to metastore where Tez AM would create ObjectStore even though it was configured later to connect to remote metastore via a query config. \nFor HS2, I don't know if we support connecting to multiple metastores. However, accessing embedded metastore from multiple threads may cause a thread safety problem.\nAlso a static like that seems pretty brittle in an abstract sense, and the API get(conf) is misleading, because it will return the instance with potentially different conf, and only set up the conf for the next call. \n\nIf we assume the same conf perhaps we should not reset staticConf if already set, and should throw if it's a different conf\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-15T19:29:24.506+0000","updated":"2015-10-15T19:30:51.720+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12904727/comment/14959785","id":"14959785","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch looks good.
