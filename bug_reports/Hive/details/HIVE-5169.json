a bulk-ETL operation is in progress, the query plan only sorts based on the SORTED BY key.\n\nThis means that the FileSinkOperator in the reducer has to keep all the dynamic partition RecordWriters open till the end of the reducer lifetime.\n\nA more MR-friendly approach would be to sort by <partition_col,sorted_col> so that the data entering the reducer will not require to keep exactly one partition and bucket open at any given time.\n\nAs a test-case a partitioned insert for the TPC-h benchmark's lineitem table will suffice\n\n{code}\ncreate table lineitem\n(L_ORDERKEY INT,\n...\npartitioned by (L_SHIPDATE STRING)\nclustered by (l_orderkey)\nsorted by (l_orderkey)\ninto 4 buckets\nstored as ORC;\n\nexplain from (select\nL_ORDERKEY ,\n...) tbl \ninsert overwrite table lineitem partition (L_SHIPDATE)\nselect *\n;\n{code}\n\nThe generated plan very clearly has \n\n{code}\n         Reduce Output Operator\n                key expressions:\n

       tag: -1\n{code}\n\nAnd col0 being L_ORDERKEY.\n\nIn the FileSinkOperator over at the reducer side, this results in a larger than usual number of open files.\n\nThis causes memory pressure due to the compression buffers used by ORC/RCFile and really slows down the reducers.\n\nA side-effect of this is that I had to pump 350Gb of TPC-h data through 4 reducers, which on occasion took > 1 hour to get from opening a file in the FS to writing the first ORC stripe.\n\nThis caused HDFS lease expiry and the task dying from that error.\n\nAll of these can be avoided by adding the partition column to the sort keys as well as the partition keys & keeping only one writer open in the FileSinkOperator.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12600643","id":"12600643","filename":"orc2.sql","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gopalv","name":"gopalv","key":"gopalv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gopal
