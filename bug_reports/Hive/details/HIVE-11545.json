This causes the operation to not attempt to parse any of the data in the table and just count it. With Tez, {{ColumnProjectUtils#isReadAllColumns}} returns true, which causes data to be deserialized. In combination with HIVE-11544, this was causing my queries using Tez to run over 100x slower than with MR.\n\nI finally traced this through, and found that the issue lies in {{HiveInputFormat#pushProjectionsAndFilters}} when the {{RecordReader}} is created. The {{JobConf}} that {{HiveInputFormat}} sees, and subsequently modifies, is the same instance the {{MapOperator}} sees when the execution engine is MapReduce. When the {{ColumnarSerDe}} instance is created, {{ColumnProjectUtils#isReadAllColumns}} is set to {{false}}.\n\nUnder Tez, {{HiveInputFormat}} sees a copy of the original {{JobConf}}, so its modifications are lost. The {{JobConf}}/{{Configuration}} that the {{MapOperator}} sees doesn't have {{hive.io.file.read.all.columns}} set, so {{ColumnProjectUtils#isReadAllColumns}} defaults to {{true}}.\n\nAs for what the fix should be, I don't really know. I debated on making this a Tez issue, but I'm generally of the opinion that passing around mutable state leads to problems, but MR has been allowing that for a while now. Maybe the client can force  {{hive.io.file.read.all.columns}} to {{false}}, but I don't know how it'd work with multiple input splits of different types.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HiveInputFormat#pushProjectionsAndFilters modifies JobConf, which is ignored","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bills","name":"bills","key":"bills","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"William Slacum","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bills","name":"bills","key":"bills","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"William Slacum","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"HDP 2.2.4.2","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-11545/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2iuzb:"}}
