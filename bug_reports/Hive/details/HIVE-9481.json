The expectation is that 'x' is written to column 'c' and 'y' is written column 'b' and 'a' is set to NULL, assuming column 'a' is NULLABLE.\n\nHive does not support this.  In Hive one has to ensure that the data producing statement has a schema that matches target table schema.\n\nSince Hive doesn't support DEFAULT value for columns in CREATE TABLE, when target schema is explicitly provided, missing columns will be set to NULL if they are NULLABLE, otherwise an error will be raised.\n\nIf/when DEFAULT clause is supported, this can be enhanced to set default value rather than NULL.\n\nThus, given {noformat}\ncreate table source (a int, b int);\ncreate table target (x int, y int, z int);\ncreate table target2 (x int, y int, z int);\n{noformat}\n{noformat}insert into target(y,z) select * from source;{noformat}\nwill mean \n{noformat}insert into target select null as x, a, b from source;{noformat}\nand \n{noformat}insert into target(z,y) select * from source;{noformat}\nwill meant \n{noformat}insert into target select null as x, b, a from source;{noformat}\n\nAlso,\n{noformat}\nfrom source \n  insert into target(y,z) select null as x, * \n  insert into target2(y,z) select null as x, source.*;\n{noformat}\n\nand for partitioned tables, given\n\n{noformat}\nGiven:\nCREATE TABLE pageviews (userid VARCHAR(64), link STRING, \"from\" STRING)\n  PARTITIONED BY (datestamp STRING) CLUSTERED BY (userid) INTO 256 BUCKETS STORED AS ORC;\n\nINSERT INTO TABLE pageviews PARTITION (datestamp = '2014-09-23')(userid,link)  \n   VALUES ('jsmith', 'mail.com');\n{noformat}\nAnd dynamic partitioning\n{noformat}\nINSERT INTO TABLE pageviews PARTITION (datestamp)(userid,datestamp,link) \n    VALUES ('jsmith', '2014-09-23', 'mail.com');\n{noformat}\n\nIn all cases, the schema specification contains columns of the target table which are matched by position to the values produced by VALUES clause/SELECT statement.  If the producer side provides values for a dynamic partition column, the column should be in the specified schema.  Static partition values are part of the partition spec and thus are not produced by the producer and should not be part of the schema specification.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12697214","id":"12697214","filename":"HIVE-9481.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene
