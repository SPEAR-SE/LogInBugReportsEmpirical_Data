Further, we do not exploit e.g. the symmetry of '=' (i.e. a = b iff b = a).\n\n- A first extension would be to normalize comparisons between field references and literals so that the lower field reference is always on the left. So, \"$6 = $3\" becomes \"$3 = $6\"; \"$6 > $3\" becomes \"$3< $6\". And \"literal <= $5\" becomes \"$5 >= literal\". This would not damage performance, and would improve a few plans.\n\n- Another possible extension. Given the predicate \"(a or b) and ((x and a) or (y and b))\", the first factor can be removed so the expression consists only of \"(x and a) or (y and b)\".\nOne possible way to recognize such cases is to transform the second factor to CNF i.e. \"(x or y) and (x or b) and (a or y) and (a or b)\", and as it contains \"(a or b)\", we would know that we can discard it. Then we could just use the original expression i.e. \"(x and a) or (y and b)\" in the predicate, once we have done the check.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Recognize additional common factors in Filter predicates","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-10770/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2ezw7:"}}
