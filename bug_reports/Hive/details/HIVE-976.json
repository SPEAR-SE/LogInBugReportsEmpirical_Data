But aren't there lines in the test output that begin with 'file:/' that should be ignored completely?\n\nAnyway, assuming that we can look at just the last token of lines that begin with 'file:/', it doesn't seem like there is a way to use only diff to handle this case. The man page for diff does not describe any useful options. I have two ideas \n\n1. Instead of using diff directly, write a script that uses diff + some additional logic to detect this condition.
