I think rand(seed) may not work if the mapper's input is not in deterministic order. As an example, suppose a mapper needs to process key {{1, 2, 3, 4, 5}}. The partition in 1st attempt is as below:\r\n{noformat}\r\nkey   rand(seed)\r\n 1  ->   1\r\n 2  ->   2\r\n 3  ->   3\r\n 4  ->   4\r\n 5  ->   5\r\n{noformat}\r\nSo there'll be 5 reducers to fetch data from this mapper. Suppose the first 4 reducers have finished. And when the 5th reducer starts, the node hosting the mapper's output is lost, so the mapper is rerun. And the 2nd attempt has the following partition:\r\n{noformat}\r\nkey   rand(seed)\r\n 1  ->   1\r\n 3  ->   2\r\n 5  ->   3\r\n 2  ->   4\r\n 4  ->   5\r\n{noformat}\r\nThen the 5th reducer is rerun and fetches key 4, which means key 4 is duplicated and key 5 is lost.\r\n\r\nTo avoid the issue, we need to make sure record reader can guarantee an order when reading data from HDFS, and we don't use shuffling that doesn't order the keys, e.g. groupByKey of Spark.
