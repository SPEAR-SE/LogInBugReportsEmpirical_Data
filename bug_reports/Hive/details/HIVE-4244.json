This number can be configurable.  It's still smaller in memory, so we may be able to get away with on writing the stripe, writing out the data directly there.  This should be comparable in performance to converting the dictionary index that is already done.\n\nAlso, if the uncompressed (but encoded) size of the dictionary + index (data stream) is greater than the size of the uncompressed size of the original data, the compressed data tends to be larger as well despite the sorting.  This will be more expensive to figure out as we don't know the size of the index until it has been run length encoded.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kevinwilfong","name":"kevinwilfong","key":"kevinwilfong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Wilfong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-28T19:09:18.484+0000","updated":"2013-03-28T19:09:18.484+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639607/comment/13616657","id":"13616657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We should play with different values, but I was guessing the right cutover point for the heuristic was at a loading of 2 to 3 (50% to 33% distinct values).\n\nWe aren't really going to know whether the heuristic is right or wrong unless we compare both encodings, which is much too expensive.
