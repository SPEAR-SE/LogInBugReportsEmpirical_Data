Given that filters are right now min-max only we can even get rid of ORC dependency and use standard HBase filters, but it will make pushdown difficult for future improvement, need to talk to Gopal and Owen/Prasanth before doing that.\n\nThis is a patch on top of umpteen other patches that are not committed, in particular HIVE-11553 and HIVE-11705, maybe others.
