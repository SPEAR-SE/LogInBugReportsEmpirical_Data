Out of 100 reducers, 99 complete in less than 40 seconds. The last reducer is doing the bulk of the work processing nearly 570 million rows. \n\nSo, let us understand what is going wrong here ..\n\non a table having 600 million records with orderkey column sorted, i created temp table with 10% sampling.  \n\ninsert overwrite table sampTempTbl (select * from lineitem tablesample (10 percent) t);\n\nselect min(l_orderkey), max(l_orderkey) from sampTempTbl ;\n12306309,    142321700\n\nwhere as on the source table, the orderkey range (select min(l_orderkey), max(l_orderkey) from lineitem)  is 1 and 600000000  \n\nSo naturally bulk of the records will be directed towards single reducer. \n\nOne way to work around this problem is to increase the hive.optimize.sampling.orderby.number to a larger value (as close as the # rows in the input source table). But then we will have to provide higher heap (hive-env.sh) for hive, otherwise it will fail while creating the Sampling Data. With larger data volume, it is not practical to sample the entire data set.
