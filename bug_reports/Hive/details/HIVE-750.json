while walking down the tree. \n\na better option would be\n\n1) merge the children's pushdown preds with the current filter op's preds\n2) run the ppd algorithm to extract pushdown predicates\n3) if step 2 does not return an empty set then skip to step 6 (new)\n4) if the current op's child is a filter operator then skip to step 6 (new)\n5) create a new filter op with the child's pushdown preds
