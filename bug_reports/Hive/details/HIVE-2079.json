The solution is still under investigation but here is the flow of the directory creations and permission settings:\n1) Have the real warehouse directory owned by the hive-thrift-server user and let that have 755 permissions.\n2) Have a temp warehouse directory for staging the creation of tables/databases, and let that have 777 permissions.\n3) When a user issues a create_table/database command, the hive-thrift-server creates the corresponding directory in the temp location. This operation happens as the user in question and the directory ends up getting owned by the user.\n4) The hive-thrift-server then moves the directory to the real warehouse directory. This operation is done as the hive-thrift-server user.Since the temp directory has 777 permissions, and the real warehouse directory is owned by the hive-thrift-server user, the move will succeed.\n\nWith all the work that has been done in mostly HIVE-1842 & HIVE-1696, the above seems possible.\n\nGranted, this won't work when hive runs in the fat-client mode. So, most likely, we will make the above be based on whether metastore is running in the local mode or not (hive.metastore.local config).\n\nMakes sense ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2011-03-30T17:51:08.386+0000","updated":"2011-03-30T17:51:08.386+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12502643/comment/13013604","id":"13013604","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Ok thanks that clears it up.
