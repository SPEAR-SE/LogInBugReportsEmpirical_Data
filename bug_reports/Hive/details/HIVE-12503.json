When we test out HepPlanner scalability properly we can enable this rule to be fired in rule collections so that we can give a globally optimal plan.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-24T15:52:21.901+0000","updated":"2015-11-24T15:52:21.901+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12915663/comment/15024716","id":"15024716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ashutoshc], makes sense, +1\n\nDo you think I should close HIVE-12508 as duplicate, or do those changes make still sense to avoid the call to {{areColumnsUnique}} till we fix CALCITE-794?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jcamachorodriguez","name":"jcamachorodriguez","key":"jcamachorodriguez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesus Camacho Rodriguez","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-24T15:55:41.209+0000","updated":"2015-11-24T15:55:41.209+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12915663/comment/15024723","id":"15024723","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am not sure of impact of CALCITE-794 [~gopalv] may test this patch out to see if he still sees that issue.
