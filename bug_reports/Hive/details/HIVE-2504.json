But, I am not sure about *always* inheriting permissions either, since this effectively implies the whole sub-tree of warehouse dir will have same permissions as warehouse dir itself. Concretely, lets consider following example. Lets say, wh dir has 700 perms. Then, if I create table (which only owner of wh can do) I will end up with either 775 or 755 (depending on whether it was before or after the earlier patch of jira). However, with your patch, table dir will end up with 700. In the earlier case, anyone could have read the tables, but now with your approach only owner can read. Now, which of this is correct behavior is open for debate and depends on which security model you have as your premise. Additionally, this will be change of behavior then the current behavior. So, I suggest you define a new config variable like {{hive.warehouse.inherit.perms}} or something similar and set it to false by default. And then take your code path of inheriting parent perms in case it is set to true. Thoughts?

The default behaviour of hive-0.8 stays. i.e directories will be created with the permissions of dfs.umask or dfs.umaskmode. If hive.warehouse.subdir.inherit.perms is set to true, then table directories will inherit the permission of the default warehouse or the custom database location. This comes in handy when you have databases created with different permissions or if the warehouse directory has permissions like 775. \n\nAshutosh,\n   Your argument of warehouse having 700 permissions will not hold. If warehouse has 700 and even if the table directories have 755 or 775 they will not be accessible by any one other than the owner because if you don't have access to the parent directory you cannot access sub-directories in dfs (Same as Linux). So the warehouse has to be at least 755 or 750 to start with. So with the initial patch, the sub-directories would have been created with 775. But with my patch, they would have been created the same as warehouse directory(755 or 750) which would still allow read access to group. But anyways to avoid any confusion and provide backward compatibility added the new config.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohini","name":"rohini","key":"rohini","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohini Palaniswamy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-09T18:40:42.726+0000","updated":"2012-04-09T18:40:42.726+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12527138/comment/13250080","id":"13250080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Closing this ticket again since Chinna's patch for HIVE-2504 was committed back in January.\n\nPlease do not reopen tickets that have been marked fixed/resolved (i.e. tickets for which a patch has already been committed).
