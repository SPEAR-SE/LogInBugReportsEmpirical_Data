Now the SerDe author has to know what options they might be interested in and what options whatever code they are invoking might be interested in. This is a non-starter.\n\nhere's some background: almost all hadoop classes implement Configurable - which means they get a Configuration object passed in at initialization time. If someone asked me what made it possible to implement Hive on Hadoop easily - this would be one of the single biggest reasons. Entire Hive execution system is bootstrapped by configuring all manners of parameters inside Hadoop's Conf with minimal overhead from our side.\n\nalso - the goal you have is nice (create a registry of options to control serde behavior - possibly with metadata about semantics/values). so yes - we can have additional interface. But we should not FORCE people to provide this metadata and implement this interface for correct functioning (and take away the flexibility to have parameters that are not declared via the new interface). does that make sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-08T22:36:18.318+0000","updated":"2008-12-08T22:36:18.318+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410215/comment/12654629","id":"12654629","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zshao","name":"zshao","key":"zshao","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=zshao&avatarId=14358"},"displayName":"Zheng Shao","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"btw there is a difference between configuration and jobconf: jobconf is a subclass of configuration: http://hadoop.apache.org/core/docs/current/api/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobConf.html\n\nWe are requiring configuration instead of jobconf.\n\nJoy and Raghu and I discussed offline and agreed this is not the current hadoop way of doing things.
