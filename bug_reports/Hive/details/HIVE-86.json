Patch looks pretty good.\n\nCouple of concerns:\n- i think we can just have one version of the isExternal command. The ql/.../Table.java has a metastore.api.Table object - and we can have an isExternal definition over that which can be shared in both places.\n- other concern is that the isExternal setting is being checked by the client side code. it seems to me that the server side should be enforcing this setting (otherwise any thrift client can come and delete data based on the thrift api regardless of the external setting). So we should (as a safety measure) be enforcing this check in HiveMetaStore.java:drop_table as well (regardless of the delete_data setting.)\n\nregarding RWTable versus HiveMetaStoreClient - sorry for all the confusion. The thing is that there are two implementations of the MetaStore available - one db backed which is the new one that we use normally. There is an old one that's file based and RWTable is used by that one (AFAIK).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-03T02:57:50.225+0000","updated":"2008-12-03T02:57:50.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409464/comment/12652751","id":"12652751","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've updated the patch to do all the checks server side as suggested, much cleaner.\nThe reason I didn't override the deleteData boolean in the previous patch is that I thought it might be useful if someone wanted to force delete an external table for whatever reason.
