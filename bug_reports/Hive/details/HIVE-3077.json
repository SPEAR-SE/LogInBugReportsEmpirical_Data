buckets; \ncreate table dest(x string) clustered by( x ) sorted by ( x ) into 32 buckets; \n\nNow, put some data into x (after enable hive.enforce.bucketing and hive.enforce.sorting to be true).\n\nThen, do:\ninsert into table dest select * from src; \n\nThis should fail since dest is a bucketized table.
