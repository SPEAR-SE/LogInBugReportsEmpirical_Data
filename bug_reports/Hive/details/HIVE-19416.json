This support can be enabled via a config flag, and is on by default.\r\n\r\nThis is achieved via the following changes, that basically start us on the path of treating ACID stats the same way we treat ACID data:\r\nIn addition to existing JSON blob, we store a write ID of the latest stats writer with each table and partition. Any writer updating the stats or altering the stats state for a txn table has to record his write ID - if the write ID and some other context is not provided by the caller of alter, the alter table/partition operation fails. It's the responsibility of the writer to not commit its transaction if the operation fails.\r\nIn future, we'd like to move the stats state into actual stats tables, but for now it's (logically) colocated with the existing json parameter.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its write ID, most callers (with the exception of the ones that cannot have races, e.g. create table) provide their own txn state (write ID list) for the table. The existing stats' write ID is verified against this state. If the write ID is not visible to the updater, we still update the stats, but set the stats state to invalid; that basically means that two parallel operations that cannot see each others' data output are updating the stats.\r\n\r\nThis way, txn stats stay valid as the result of a sequence of non-conflicting updates that can all see each other and account for each others' data for the stats. Any parallel updates invalidate the stats.\r\nThis is necessary because unlike data, stats are a single version summary of the table. To be able to support parallel operations with valid stats, each stats update would need to write a separate record, and would also need to write mergeable records that only reflect its own changes, instead of the final view of the table stats (two of those are hard or impossible to merge).\r\n\r\nThis approach resulted in a few changes to alter/etc APIs in metastore; it also requires that many alter operations, as well as analyze table, allocate a write ID (because they affect stats-that-are-treated-like-data, and so are essentially a write operation).\r\n\r\nThe reader, in turn, verifies that the stats are valid and written by a write ID that is itself valid given the reader's transactional state (i.e. not aborted, nor in progress). This is done on metastore side; if the stats are invalid for the reader, we transparently update the stats state returned to the caller to mark the stats as inaccurate.\r\n\r\nWe've considered (and actually implemented) an alternative approach of recording the full txn state of the stats writer to be compared with the state of the stats reader (to see if they are compatible and avoid the extra write IDs and strict write-time checks), however it results in problems with partitioned tables, where not all writes affect all partitions, and so the stats state of all the untouched partitions becomes invalid once a subset of partitions is updated (because we cannot tell whether the write ID, a table level operation, didn't touch the partition, or did touch it but didn't record the stats). Additionally, storing full txn state for every partition and table can be expensive, especially in extreme cases where the watermark doesn't advance for a while for some reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Create single version transactional table metastore statistics for aggregation queries","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steveyeom2017","name":"steveyeom2017","key":"steveyeom2017","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10448","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10448","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10448","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10448"},"displayName":"Steve Yeom","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[{"id":"13157007","key":"HIVE-19417","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13157007","fields":{"summary":"Modify metastore to have/access persistent tables for stats","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.

Definitions and Categories\r\n  - Valid transactional stats: \r\n    I.e., a conjunction of the three:\r\n    ~ a committed transaction created the stats \r\n    ~ COLUMN_STATE_ACCURATE(CSA) state is true\r\n    ~ Isolation-level (snapshot) compliant\r\n  - Two kinds of stats: table and column \r\n  - COLUMN_STATS_ACCURATE(CSA) states for a table/partition: true or false.\r\n     one for table, one per each column\r\n  - Categories of clients: \r\n    ~ Stats reader: \r\n      ^ StatsOptimizer for aggregation query: transactional stats reader\r\n      ^ The rest that uses stats for cost computation inputs: non-transactional stats reader\r\n    ~ Stats updater: transactional stats updater\r\n\r\n2. Transactional Stats Operations\r\n  2.1 Stats Update\r\n    Update the single version stats, both table and column and save a table snapshot to UPD_TXNS.\r\n    - A client requests an update with stats and a table snapshot [1].\r\n    - creates a TBLS/PARTITIONS row adding a row into UPD_TXNS row with table write snapshot.\r\n      ~ Updates \"table stats\" by updading TABLE_PARAMS/PARTITION_PARAMS\r\n    - Updates \"column stats\" by updating TAB_COL_STATS/PART_COL_STATS\r\n    - commit/abort\r\n      ~ abortTcn() deletes the UPD_TXN row for the transaction.\r\n\r\n    Note: now stats reader determines the state of the transactional stats' updater transaction\r\n      by checking TXNS for open state, and checking existence of a row in UPD_TXNS for committed/aborted.\r\n\r\n  2.2 Stats Read\r\n    StatsOptimizer determines validity of the MetaStore transactional stats \r\n    to use stats for an aggregation query.\r\n    2.2.1 Table stats\r\n      The reader gets a TBLS/PARTITIONS row that includes table stats. \r\n      Then check the validity of the table stats.\r\n      - A client comes in with its request that includes the client's table snapshot. \r\n      - Reads a row from TBLS/PARTITIONS.\r\n      - Check if the CSA for table stats is true.

The rest will remain the same.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-15T23:06:24.371+0000","updated":"2018-06-15T23:27:17.590+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13157004/comment/16523931","id":"16523931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"RE: lock acquisition.  The lock manager doesn't have an y deadlock detection logic in it.  It works by acquiring all locks for a given txn in 1 atomic operation.  So if locks are acquired piece meal, it can lead to deadlock.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-26T16:21:56.142+0000","updated":"2018-06-26T16:21:56.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13157004/comment/16552191","id":"16552191","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vgarg","name":"vgarg","key":"vgarg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=vgarg&avatarId=30430","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=vgarg&avatarId=30430","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=vgarg&avatarId=30430","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=vgarg&avatarId=30430"},"displayName":"Vineet Garg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~steveyeom2017] [~sershe] Is there a design document or some kind of documentation for this?
