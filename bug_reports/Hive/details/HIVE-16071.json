It seems that your patch basically reverts the change made in HIVE-15671. There is a long discussion in that JIRA, and you might want to visit that. The short summary is that hive.spark.client.connect.timeout is for SASL handshake, which happens after the remote driver is launched. This timeout doesn't need to be too long. On the other hand, hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout is the timeout for Hive to wait for the remote driver to connect back. Because launching the remote driver takes time, not to mention there could be resource constraint, it takes much longer. I understand this is a frequent confusion that bothers many of us, so it's not surprising that this comes back again.\n\nThe particular problem you saw might not be attributed to a bug. SASL usually takes little time to establish. If the default value is too short for your network, you might consider to increase the timeout value a bit.\n\nCC: [~vanzin]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-01T04:17:19.350+0000","updated":"2017-03-01T04:17:19.350+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13047177/comment/15889641","id":"15889641","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12855287/HIVE-16071.patch\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to no test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to 2 failed/errored test(s), 10298 tests executed\n*Failed tests:*\n{noformat}\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestMiniLlapLocalCliDriver.testCliDriver[schema_evol_text_vec_table] (batchId=147)\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestPerfCliDriver.testCliDriver[query23] (batchId=223)\n{noformat}\n\nTest results: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/3859/testReport\nConsole output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-HIVE-Build/3859/console\nTest logs: http://104.198.109.242/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-Build-3859/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.TestCheckPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\nTests exited with: TestsFailedException: 2 tests failed\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12855287 - PreCommit-HIVE-Build","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-03-01T06:55:57.071+0000","updated":"2017-03-01T06:55:57.071+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13047177/comment/15889695","id":"15889695","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lirui","name":"lirui","key":"lirui","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rui Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"My understanding is the timeout on SparkClient side is longer because it needs to wait for the RemoteDriver to launch. The timeout on the RemoteDriver side should be shorter because the SparkClient is already running when RemoteDriver starts - and it usually won't take long to just connect back and finish SASL handshake. Although the default 1000ms may be a little too short.\n\nLooking at the stack trace in description, we detect the channel is closed and eventually get a {{SaslException}} instead of a {{TimeoutException}}. I wonder why the channel is closed before the handshake finishes.

It happened when SaslServerHandler and SaslClientHandler were undergoing handshaking. The timeout caused the registerClient in SparkClientImpl to throw out an error which interrupted the process calling spark-submit, therefore ending the channel between HS2 and RemoteClient. The channel termination was detected by SaslClientHandler.channelInactive at RemoteDriver side, which in term invoked SaslClientHandler.dispose(). Therefore we saw the SASLException with msg \"SaslException: Client closed before SASL negotiation finished.\"I have managed to reproduce this error by adjusting the hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout value to make the HS2 timeout happen during SASL negotiation but RemoteDriver has not reached its own timeout.\n\nLooking more into the code, I think that the [cancelTask|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/RpcServer.java#L100] is not used at all in the code. It never has a chance to effect because it has the same timeout value as that used for [registerClient|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/RpcServer.java#L170], and the latter one always kicks in before it.\nTimeout at RemoteDriver side could happen at two places. If it happens when driver [connects|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/Rpc.java#L110] back to HS2, HS2 could not detect this timeout error at driver site and has to wait until its own timeout set in  [registerClient|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/RpcServer.java#L170] effects. If the [timeout|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/Rpc.java#L122] happens during SASL handshaking, the RemoteDriver main will exit abnormally. The SaslServerHandler.channelInactive at HS2 side could detect this channel termination and invokes the SaslServerHandler.dispose, which in term cancels this cancelTask (not be used again). Depending on the stage where HS2 is at (see following code snippet) \n{code}\n    protected void onError(Throwable error) {\n      cancelTask.cancel(true);\n      if (client != null) {\n        client.timeoutFuture.cancel(true);\n        if (!client.promise.isDone()) {\n          client.promise.setFailure(error);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n{code}\nHS2 should either wait until its hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout when clientInfo is null, or terminates the process immediately.\nSo the [cancelTask|https://github.com/apache/hive/blob/master/spark-client/src/main/java/org/apache/hive/spark/client/rpc/RpcServer.java#L100] is currently useless in the code unless its timeout could be set with a different (shorter) value than that set for registerClient (hive.spark.client.server.connect.timeout).

This way, we are consistent on both server side and client side.\n\nOn the other hand, if we user server.connect.timeout for both registerClient and cancelTask, then what can happens is that if Sasl handshake happens right after registerClient but failed to establish and if the connection isn't actually broken at that point, then the server will detect a connection loss and so will not react to this until registerClient timeout, which can be significantly delayed (1hr in our case rather just a few seconds).\n\nThus, what your found seems to be a bug, however rarely it happens.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-07T03:43:52.968+0000","updated":"2017-03-07T03:43:52.968+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13047177/comment/15898962","id":"15898962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lirui","name":"lirui","key":"lirui","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rui Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi [~xuefuz] and [~ctang.ma], I'd prefer removing the cancelTask.

If the cluster resource is available, while the network is super busy at the moment, then Sasl handshake may have issues. In such case, we don't want HiveServer wait for 1 hour before declaring a failure. The same thing on the remote driver side. In HIVE-15671 we fixed the problem on driver side.
