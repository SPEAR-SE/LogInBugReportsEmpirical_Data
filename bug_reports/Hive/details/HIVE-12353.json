highestTxnId;\n{code}\nThroughout you seem to assume this will be 0 and never null, but I'm not clear why.\n\nIn markCleaned, why do the insert into COMPLETED_COMPACTIONS as a prepared statement?  You're only executing this once per call, what's the value of preparing the statement?  This isn't a big deal.\n\nA concern on the history stuff.  By keeping not just the last x records, but the last number of success, fails, and attempts it may be hard for users to see that there were actually 50 successes since the 2 fails shown in the compaction history.  How will we make that clear to users?  Perhaps you have enough info in the sequence numbers to communicate that.\n\nIn checkFailedCompactions:\n{code}\n812\t        while(rs.next() && ++numTotal <= failedThreshold) {\n813\t          if(rs.getString(1).charAt(0) == FAILED_STATE) {\n814\t            numFailed++;\n815\t          }\n816\t          else {\n817\t            numFailed--;\n818\t          }\n819\t        }\n{code}\nThis logic doesn't look right to me.  This will allow an accumulation of failures over time to stop compaction, even if there have been intervening successes.  It seems it should stop counting as soon as it sees a success in the list of compactions, on the assumption that whatever was previously blocking compaction is fixed at that point.\n\nIt also seems users could unwittingly mess things up by setting config values poorly.  If, for example, they set the number of retained failures to be 2 but the number of consecutive failures that prevents further compactions to 5, they'd most likely never block compaction, as the new house keeping thread would remove the history too quickly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alangates","name":"alangates","key":"alangates","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Gates","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-01-21T01:50:39.775+0000","updated":"2016-01-21T01:50:39.775+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12910849/comment/15110009","id":"15110009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. info.highestTxnId = rs.wasNull() ? null : highestTxnId;\nResultSet.getLong() returns 0 when value was actually NULL so I thought it would be more consistent with other places in the code that use 0 as invalid txn id\n\nbq.
