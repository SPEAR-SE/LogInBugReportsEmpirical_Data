So the behavior is inconsistent depending on the value of {{recursive}}.\n\nWe should decide whether or not permission inheritance should fail queries or not, and then ensure the code consistently follows that decision.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12842306","id":"12842306","filename":"HIVE-15385.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-12-08T07:59:24.150+0000","size":11326,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12842306/HIVE-15385.1.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12842388","id":"12842388","filename":"HIVE-15385.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-12-08T18:33:57.347+0000","size":22942,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12842388/HIVE-15385.2.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Failure to inherit permissions when running HdfsUtils.setFullFileStatus(..., false) causes queries to fail","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13026518/comment/15730435","id":"15730435","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~spena] does my explanation of the situation make sense?

Here is the failure that I am hitting:\n\nHDFS permission inheritance follows the BSD rule: when a new file is created, it inherits the group of the parent directory. There are situations in Hive when trying to inherit the group of the parent can fail, failure to set the group can occur in the following situation:\n\n1: {{user1}} uploads a file into HDFS directory {{/test1/}} where {{/test1/}} has group {{user1}}\n2: The {{/user/hive/warehouse}} directory was created by the {{hive}} user and has group {{hive}}\n3: {{user1}} runs a query that loads data from {{/test1/}} and writes it to {{/user/hive/warehouse/}}\n4: The problem is that when the data is moved from {{/test1/}} to {{/user/hive/warehouse/}}, it retains its original group {{user1}}\n5: Hive then tries to set the group to {{hive}} in order to preserve permission inheritance, but this fails because the query is running as {{user1}}, but {{user1}} is not part of the {{hive}} group and is not allowed to change the group of a file to {{hive}}\n\nI think the {{chgrp}} logic is similar to other standard POSIX systems.\n\nI think there can be other situations too, but I'm not an expert in this area so I would have to play around with it some more.\n\nI've confirmed that everywhere this method is used inherit perms is true, except for one place: {{DDLTask.truncateTable}} (which looks like it should be checking if inherit perms is true).\n\nMost of the invocations of {{setFullFileStatus}} are wrapped by a try-catch block which just logs the exception. There are only a few place where they are propagated up to the caller, these were all introduced by HIVE-12988, HIVE-13716, and HIVE-13933 - seemingly by accident.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stakiar","name":"stakiar","key":"stakiar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sahil Takiar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-12-08T21:37:08.912+0000","updated":"2016-12-08T21:37:08.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13026518/comment/15735896","id":"15735896","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=spena","name":"spena","key":"spena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergio Peña","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks [~stakiar] for the explanation.
