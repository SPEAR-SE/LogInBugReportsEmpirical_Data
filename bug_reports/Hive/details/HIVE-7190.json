Launcher jobs are 1-map jobs (a single task jobs) which kick off the actual user job and monitor it until it finishes. Given that the launcher is a task, like any other MR task, it has a retry policy in case it fails (due to a task crash, tasktracker/nodemanager crash, machine level outage, etc.). Further, when launcher task is retried, it will again launch the same user job, *however* the previous attempt user job is already running. What this means is that we can have two identical user jobs running in parallel. \n\nIn case of MRv2, there will be an MRAppMaster and the launcher task, which are subject to failure. In case any of the two fails, another instance of a user job will be launched again in parallel. \n\nAbove situation is already a bug.\n\nNow going further to RM HA, what RM does on failover/restart is that it kills all containers, and it restarts all applications. This means that if our customer had 10 jobs on the cluster (this is 10 launcher jobs and 10 user jobs), on RM failover, all 20 jobs will be restarted, and launcher jobs will queue user jobs again. There are two issues with this design:\n1. There are *possible* chances for corruption of job outputs (it would be useful to analyze this scenario more and confirm this statement).\n2. Cluster resources are spent on jobs redundantly\n\nTo address the issue at least on Yarn (Hadoop 2.0) clusters, webhcat should do the same thing Oozie does in this scenario, and that is to tag all its child jobs with an id, and kill those jobs on task restart before they are kicked off again.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12648742","id":"12648742","filename":"HIVE-7190.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan

Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Attaching the initial patch.\n\nApproach in the patch is similar to what Oozie does to handle this situation. Specifically, all child map jobs get tagged with the launcher MR job id. On launcher task restart, launcher queries RM for the list of jobs that have the tag and kills them. After that it moves on to start the same child job again. Again, similarly to what Oozie does, a new {{templeton.job.launch.time}} property is introduced that captures the launcher job submit timestamp and later used to reduce the search window when RM is queried. \n\nI have validated that MR, Pig and Hive jobs do get tagged appropriately. I have also validated that previous child jobs do get killed on RM failover/task failure.\n\nTo validate the patch, you will need to add webhcat shim jars to templeton.libjars as now webhcat launcher also has a dependency on hadoop shims. \n\nI have noticed that in case of the SqoopDelegator webhcat currently does not set the MR delegation token when optionsFile flag is used. This also creates the problem in this scenario. This looks like something that should be handled via a separate Jira.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-06-06T21:15:55.183+0000","updated":"2014-06-06T21:15:55.183+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12718938/comment/14020435","id":"14020435","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Review board: https://reviews.apache.org/r/22329/ ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-06-06T22:03:29.152+0000","updated":"2014-06-06T22:03:29.152+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12718938/comment/14020437","id":"14020437","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Rebasing patch against latest hive trunk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-06-06T22:03:58.117+0000","updated":"2014-06-06T22:03:58.117+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12718938/comment/14028618","id":"14028618","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Addressing Eugene's feedback.
