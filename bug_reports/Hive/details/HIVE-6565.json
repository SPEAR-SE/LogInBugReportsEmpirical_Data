I got few problems when I work on Cascading and Hive/HCatalog integration(https://github.com/branky/cascading.hive). They can be fixed along with HIVE-6163 (was also reported by me) and HIVE-5728. I did patch on my own fork of Hive(https://github.com/branky/hive/commit/20c62b3ec73a55d84eeffca6eab4af066e04e22a) to make the integration work. \n\nRegarding this issue, I found the fix may not be that simple. OrcSerde is included in ql module which depend on serde module actually. Then it will cause cyclic dependency. I would cancel this issue and try to find other workaround.
