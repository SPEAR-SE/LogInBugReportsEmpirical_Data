This can break many TRANSFORM queries.\n\nThe solution is to have a ROW FORMAT semantics that can be attached to an individual TRANSFORM instance. It would have the same semantics as table creation, but during serialization it would ensure that any formal delimiter characters that did not indicate an actual break between columns would be escaped.\n\nAt the very least, it is a bug that TRANSFORM statement deserialization does not backslash out literal tabs in the current implementation.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"123796","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"TRANSFORM statements should come with their own ROW FORMATs.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=akramer","name":"akramer","key":"akramer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adam Kramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=akramer","name":"akramer","key":"akramer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adam Kramer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-2311/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ljf3:"}}
