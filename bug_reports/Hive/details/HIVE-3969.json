a client add jar files for initializing, hive server makes a new classloader and attach it to thread as a context loader. Cause hive server uses thread pool and there is no cleanup for threads, number of class loader increases constantly, which can make possibly a memory issue.

I know HiveServer2 is already on a way to be committed. Would it be better to fix session problems in hiveserver also or to make it deprecated quickly after hiveserver2 is committed? I don't know.

It is insufficient to reset the classloader as this doesn't close connections to jar files. I've pasted the relevant part of the blog here:\n\nThere was one issue that was a little perplexing. After running for a week or so, QHS (Qubole Hive Server) starting throwing “too many files open” exceptions. A quick lsof call confirmed that there were numerous open file handles. Surprisingly, though, these all pointed to jar files. After some investigation, we found that the URLClassLoader leaks file handles to jars it opens (see this [link|http://management-platform.blogspot.in/2009/01/classloaders-keeping-jar-files-open.html] for some dirty details). These are never garbage collected. We ended up using the non-standard ClassLoaderUtil.releaseLoader to free up resources. Java 7 has a nicer solution for this where URLClassLoader has a close method that performs the necessary cleanup.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=snarayanan","name":"snarayanan","key":"snarayanan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sivaramakrishnan Narayanan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-09-02T10:13:15.018+0000","updated":"2013-09-02T10:13:15.018+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12630265/comment/13758804","id":"13758804","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=navis","name":"navis","key":"navis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885"},"displayName":"Navis","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"[~snarayanan] Thanks for your comment.
