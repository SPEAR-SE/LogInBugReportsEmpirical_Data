mapred.input.dir is too long.\n\nAny other environment variable that is \"too long\" for the host OS will still cause a job failure.\n\nIn my case:\nWhile creating a table with a large number of columns, a large hive variable is temporarily created using SET, the variable contains the columns and column descriptions.\nA CREATE TABLE statement then successfully uses that large variable.\nAfter successfully creating the table the hive script attempts to load data into the table using a TRANSFORM script, triggering the error:\njava.io.IOException: error=7, Argument list too long\nSince the variable is no longer used after the table is created, the hive script was updated to SET the large variable to empty.\nAfter setting the variable empty the second statement in the hive script ran fine.\n\nHive should more gracefully notify the user as to the cause of the problem and offer a configurable approach for automatically handling the condition.\n\nIn this case, originally identifying the cause of the issue was somewhat confusing since the portion of the hive script that referenced the long variable ran successfully, and the portion of the script that failed didn't even use/reference the variable that was causing that portion to fail.\n\nSince HIVE-2372 has already been \"Fixed\" this JIRA re-opens the issue since the original issue was worked around, not resolved...\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12651328","id":"12651328","filename":"HIVE-7218.1.patch.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=navis","name":"navis","key":"navis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885"},"displayName":"Navis","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"created":"2014-06-19T00:42:39.189+0000","size":13165,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12651328/HIVE-7218.1.patch.txt"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"398993","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"java.io.IOException:
