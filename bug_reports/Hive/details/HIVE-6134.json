A few questions/comments:\n1. Could you elaborate on why you think it makes sense to only merge small files for queries resulting in a new table? Alternatively, what are the issues for supporting these properties for regular queries? I'd love to have this support for regular queries, unless there's a strong reason against it.\n2. If indeed these properties are designed only for queries resulting in a new table, then we should mention that in the documentation. Currently it's misleading - it sounds like they'd work for regular queries as well.\n3. The main pain point here is that users won't know that there are many output files until AFTER the query is run. Imagine analysts who don't know these details and HUE is the only query interface for them. It's frustrating and time consuming to run a long-running query in Hue, only to find out they can't get the results b/c HUE times out trying to read these many small files, and so they'll have to run the query again as CTAS. Having a table just so they could download the result seems to be an overkill.\n4. Do you have a suggestion for the aforementioned HUE issue? Hue starts timing out when the query results in thousands of small output files. This is a major pain point for our analysts today.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ericchu30","name":"ericchu30","key":"ericchu30","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Chu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-03T20:18:29.143+0000","updated":"2014-01-03T20:18:29.143+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12687216/comment/13861903","id":"13861903","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ericchu30] I guess my above comments was a little off the topic.

I'm wondering if the problem #2 (too many small files from a query) is root caused by problem #1 (too many small files for a table). I cannot image a case of that (besides too many mappers or reducers), but appreciate if you can share your case.\n\nIf the answer is yes, then the proposal that I outlined above may prevent problem #2 from happening. If no, then it may makes sense to have both.

However, the comments did mention about movetask, which may be related to the code you saw.\n\nFor the Hue issue you mentioned, I'd think that getting rid of the small files one way or the other seems reasonable.

If we choose to selectively, then the challenge is to know when to merge the result.\n\nIf the user has a better idea, then we can extend the Hive syntax to provide a construct such as \"SELECTM col1, col2 FROM table1\",  but from your description, the users may not have that sense. They will not know until the query fails. \"Select and merge\" approach is close to your workaround of a temp table, right?\n\nHaving too many partitions pose many challenges including the problem you're facing. I'd suggest you revisit your partition strategy and try to reduce the number of partitions that a query would involve.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-06T19:25:18.758+0000","updated":"2014-01-06T19:25:18.758+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12687216/comment/13863512","id":"13863512","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ericchu30","name":"ericchu30","key":"ericchu30","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Chu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~xuefuz] Regarding when to merge, isn't that precisely what hive.merge.mapfiles, hive.merge.mapredfiles, and hive.merge.smallfiles.avgsize are for?
