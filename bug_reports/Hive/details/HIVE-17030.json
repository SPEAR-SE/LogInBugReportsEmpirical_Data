Addressing some or all of these issues would make HPL/SQL more accessible to newcomers.\n\nConsider this code:\n{code}\n  val1d := cast('10.0' as double);\n  val2d := cast('5.0' as double);\n  declare val1i int = 5;\n  declare val2i int = 5;\n  val1i = val1d;\n  diff := val1i - val2i;\n{code}\n\nWhat is the value of diff? You might think it is 5 but in fact it is 0. Why? Because when you attempt to assign val1i to val1d, this code in Var.java is executed:\n\n{code}\n    else if (type == Type.BIGINT) {\n      if (val.type == Type.STRING) {\n        value = Long.parseLong((String)val.value);\n      }\n    }\n    else if (type == Type.DECIMAL) {\n{code}\n\nSince there is no case for assigning a double to a bigint, the expression is essentially ignored and the value remains the same. This behavior leads to many surprising results.\n\nIt would be best if HPL/SQL could re-use the cast code from Hive since there are a lot of cases to consider.\n\nVersion = 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT r71f52d8ad512904b3f2c4f04fe39a33f2834f1f2","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12886087","id":"12886087","filename":"HIVE-17030.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmtolpeko","name":"dmtolpeko","key":"dmtolpeko","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dmitry Tolpeko","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-09-08T14:22:59.878+0000","size":5130,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12886087/HIVE-17030.1.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HPL/SQL: Many cast operations are ignored without warning or notice.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cartershanklin","name":"cartershanklin","key":"cartershanklin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carter Shanklin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cartershanklin","name":"cartershanklin","key":"cartershanklin","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carter Shanklin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13084629/comment/16159590","id":"16159590","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12886087/HIVE-17030.1.patch\n\n{color:green}SUCCESS:{color} +1 due to 1 test(s) being added or modified.\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to 4 failed/errored test(s), 11035 tests executed\n*Failed tests:*\n{noformat}\nTestAccumuloCliDriver -
