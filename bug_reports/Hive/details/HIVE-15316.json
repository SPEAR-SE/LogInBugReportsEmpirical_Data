table that has been created as Avro via CTAS when the target struct is at least 2 struct-levels deep. It can be replicated with the following steps:\n\n{code}\nCREATE TABLE a\n  STORED AS AVRO\n  AS\nSELECT named_struct('c', named_struct('d', 1)) as b;\n\nSELECT b FROM a;\n\norg.apache.avro.AvroTypeException: Found default.record_0, expecting union\n{code}\n\nThe reason for this is that during table creation, the Avro schema is generated from the Hive columns in {{AvroSerDe}} and then passed through the Avro Schema Parser: {{new Schema.Parser().parse(schema.toString())}}. For the above example, this creates the below schema in the Avro file. Note that the lowest level struct, {{record_0}} has {{\"namespace\": \"default\"}}.\n\n{code}\n{\n  \"type\": \"record\",\n  \"name\": \"a\",\n  \"namespace\": \"default\",\n  \"fields\": [\n    {\n      \"name\": \"b\",\n      \"type\": [\n        \"null\",\n        {\n          \"type\": \"record\",\n          \"name\": \"record_1\",\n          \"namespace\": \"\",\n          \"doc\": \"struct<c:struct<d:int>>\",\n          \"fields\": [\n            {\n              \"name\": \"c\",\n              \"type\": [\n                \"null\",\n                {\n                  \"type\": \"record\",\n                  \"name\": \"record_0\",\n                  \"namespace\": \"default\",\n                  \"doc\": \"struct<d:int>\",\n                  \"fields\": [\n                    {\n                      \"name\": \"d\",\n                      \"type\": [ \"null\", \"int\" ],\n                      \"doc\": \"int\",\n                      \"default\": null\n                    }\n                  ]\n                }\n              ],\n              \"doc\": \"struct<d:int>\",\n              \"default\": null\n            }\n          ]\n        }\n      ],\n      \"default\": null\n    }\n  ]\n}\n{code}\n\nOn a subsequent select query, the Avro schema is again generated from the Hive columns. However, this time it is not passed through the Avro Schema Parser and the {{namespace}} attribute is not present in {{record_0}}. The actual Error message _\"Found default.record_0, expecting union\"_ is slightly misleading. Although it is expecting a union, it is specifically expecting a null or a record named {{record_0}} but it finds {{default.record_0}}.\n\nI believe this is a bug in Avro. I'm not sure whether the correct behaviour is to cascade the namespace down or not but it is definitely an inconsistency between creating a schema via the builders and parser. I've created [AVRO-1965|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AVRO-1965] for this. However, I believe that defensively passing the schema through the Avro Schema Parser on a select query would fix this issue in Hive without an Avro fix and version bump in Hive.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"CTAS STORED AS AVRO: AvroTypeException Found default.record_0, expecting union","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nahguam","name":"nahguam","key":"nahguam","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Maughan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nahguam","name":"nahguam","key":"nahguam","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Maughan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-15316/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i36yiv:"}}
