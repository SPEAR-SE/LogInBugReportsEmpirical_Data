This isn't a problem in HiveInputFormat since the directory you're looking up always uses the same format as the keys, but in CombineHiveInputFormat, we take that path and look up its children in the file system to get all the block information, and then use one of the returned paths to get the partition info -- and that returned path does not include the port.  So, in any stage after the first, we are looking for a path without the port, but all the keys in the map contain a port, so we don't find a match.\n\nThe attached patch may not be ideal -- it doesn't fix the underlying problem of inconsistent path formats in pathToPartitionInfo -- it just works around it by walking through the map and looking for a matching path rather than doing a hash lookup.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12428735","id":"12428735","filename":"hive.1006.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlerman","name":"dlerman","key":"dlerman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Lerman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-22T15:14:05.793+0000","size":1158,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12428735/hive.1006.1.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12428739","id":"12428739","filename":"hive.1006.2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlerman","name":"dlerman","key":"dlerman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Lerman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-22T16:40:19.316+0000","size":1398,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12428739/hive.1006.2.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"122743","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"getPartitionDescFromPath failing from CombineHiveInputFormat","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlerman","name":"dlerman","key":"dlerman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Lerman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dlerman","name":"dlerman","key":"dlerman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Lerman","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444020/comment/12793657","id":"12793657","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=namit","name":"namit","key":"namit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Namit Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I am getting some compilation errors while applying this patch -
