Hive.java internally uses ThreadLocal to hand out instances, but since Task.initialize() is called by a single thread from the Driver multiple tasks share an instance of Hive.\n\nEach Hive instances has a single instance of MetaStoreClient; the later is not thread safe.\n\nWith hive.exec.parallel=true, different threads actually execute the tasks, different threads end up sharing the same MetaStoreClient.\n\nIf you make 2 concurrent calls, for example Hive.getTable(String), the Thrift responses may return to the wrong caller.\nThus the first caller gets \"out of sequence response\", drops this message and reconnects.  If the timing is right, it will consume the other's response, but the the other caller will block for hive.metastore.client.socket.timeout since its response message has now been lost.\n\nThis is just one concrete example.\n\nOne possible fix is to make Task.db use ThreadLocal.\n\nThis could be related to HIVE-6893","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"hive.exec.parallel=true causes \"out of sequence response\" and SocketTimeoutException: Read timed out","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ekoifman","name":"ekoifman","key":"ekoifman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eugene Koifman","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822412/comment/15308100","id":"15308100","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ngangam","name":"ngangam","key":"ngangam","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naveen Gangam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"This should be resolved by HIVE-10956 (session threadlocals are shared by other threads in the same hive session) + HIVE-12790.
