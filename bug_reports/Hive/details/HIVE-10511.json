For #1, Beeline provides or is supposed to provides equal functionality, yet is implemented differently from Hive CLI.\n\nAs it has been a while that Hive community has been recommending Beeline + HS2 configuration, ideally we should deprecating Hive CLI. Because of wide use of Hive CLI, we instead propose replacing Hive CLI's implementation with Beeline plus embedded HS2 so that Hive community only needs to maintain a single code path. In this way, Hive CLI is just an alias to Beeline at either shell script level or at high code level. The goal is that  no changes or minimum changes are expected from existing user scrip using Hive CLI.\n\nThis is an Umbrella JIRA covering all tasks related to this initiative. Over the last year or two, Beeline has been improved significantly to match what Hive CLI offers. Still, there may still be some gaps or deficiency to be discovered and fixed. In the meantime, we also want to make sure the enough tests are included and performance impact is identified and addressed.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Replacing the implementation of Hive CLI using Beeline","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xuefuz","name":"xuefuz","key":"xuefuz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Xuefu Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[{"id":"12825349","key":"HIVE-10515","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12825349","fields":{"summary":"Create tests to cover existing (supported) Hive CLI functionality","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/5","description":"A resolution has been taken, and it is awaiting verification by reporter.
