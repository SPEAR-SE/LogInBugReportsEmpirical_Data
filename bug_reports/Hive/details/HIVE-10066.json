When it runs on a worker node, everything was pre-packaged and made available to the worker node via the distributed cache via the client code. Hence, its client-side configs are also only needed on the same (client) node as where it is installed. The only other install step needed is to have the tez tarball be uploaded to HDFS and the config has an entry “tez.lib.uris” which points to the HDFS path. \"\n\n\n\n\nWe need a way to pass client
