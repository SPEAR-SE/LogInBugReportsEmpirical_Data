The included TestArrayCompatibility tests will run on trunk and can be used to verify that the current array representation has not been changed and to see the current behavior for Avro, Thrift, and repeated types without annotations.\n\nThis patch has the following behavior consequences:\n1. Avro and Thrift data structures that could be read previously will match the original Avro or Thrift type. This is the case when Avro stored, for example, a {{array<struct<f1: int>>}}. This structure matched Hive's 3-level representation of arrays, so it could be read, although the inner Avro record level was discarded by the SerDe and the type in Hive would be {{array<int>}}.\n2. Lists must be annotated with {{LIST}} and maps with {{MAP}}. This was assumed by the previous version. This is a safe change because all Parquet object models have correctly used these annotations.\n3. Repeated groups with 3 or more fields and repeated primitive types are now supported.\n\nThe Hive SerDe expects an extra {{ArrayWritable}} layer from the Parquet {{Converter}}. This expectation has been preserved and all list and map structures artificially include it so that the SerDe doesn't need to be changed. This should be done as a follow-up issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdblue","name":"rdblue","key":"rdblue","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387"},"displayName":"Ryan Blue","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-19T01:01:21.965+0000","updated":"2014-11-19T01:01:21.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12756268/comment/14217179","id":"14217179","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdblue","name":"rdblue","key":"rdblue","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387"},"displayName":"Ryan Blue","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~spena], [~brocknoland], and [~mickaellcr], I think you will all be interested in this issue, which fixes Hive with data written by other formats.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdblue","name":"rdblue","key":"rdblue","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rdblue&avatarId=20387"},"displayName":"Ryan Blue","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-19T01:02:36.755+0000","updated":"2014-11-19T01:02:36.755+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12756268/comment/14217190","id":"14217190","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=brocknoland","name":"brocknoland","key":"brocknoland","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brock Noland","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Excellent work!

Otherwise, the repeated field's type is the element type with the repeated field's repetition.\n\nIt also structures the converters to match the other projects. LIST and MAP will use ElementConverter and KeyValueConverter and the list version supports these rules while matching the ArrayWritable structure expected by the SerDe (confirmed by tests that pass in both trunk and this patch).\n\nRepeated groups that aren't annotated are deserialized into lists as before, but I changed this to put less work on the DataWritableGroupConverter that is now called StructConverter. Struct needs to support repeated inner groups, but rather than keeping a second array of objects, it passes its start() and end() calls to the repeated children converters, which use them to add the correct object to the struct.
