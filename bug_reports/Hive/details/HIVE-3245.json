That should already be a requirement for client's wishing to display utf-8 characters.\n\nThe code that Mark Grover mentioned does not apply anymore, as new JDBCDriver gets results from HiveServer directly via ThriftString field, and does not do another round of serialization/deserialization on client side, where it is said the error occurred.  So in my opinion, the issue can be closed for Hive driver.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szehon","name":"szehon","key":"szehon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Szehon Ho","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Paris"},"created":"2013-12-07T00:52:57.811+0000","updated":"2013-12-07T00:52:57.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12598024/comment/13842258","id":"13842258","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=the6campbells","name":"the6campbells","key":"the6campbells","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"N Campbell","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Re the prior comment.

That is different from old JDBC driver in which there was code (as pointed out by Mark Grover), that did do some decoding and re-encoding.
