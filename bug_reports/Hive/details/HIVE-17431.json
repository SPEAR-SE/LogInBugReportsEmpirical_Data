That calls canWork..., that only checks doAs and queue name; then calls the private getSession/2. That again checks doAs and queue, also validates the config; however, if doAs and queue check out, it returns the session from the pool without ever using conf again.\r\nThen, the only way conf interacts with the session is if it's not open (shouldn't happen with pool sessions on main path), or to add resources. Adding resources passes the conf from TezTask around, and doesn't interact with session's own config. Only resources are changed based on the external (to the session) conf object.\r\nSo, on this path the user config is never applied (beyond what's sent with the DAG, if anything).\r\n\r\nSo it seems like it's inconsistent between special cases (custom queue, doAs, reopen, pool session not open - the new session will be opened with the new conf from TezTask) and the normal case where the session will not get the new config, it will just come from the pool with whatever config it had. When the files are missing it looks like they are added without reopen (first in in TezTask::updateSession, and then eventually via calling addAppMasterLocalFiles in submit).\r\nGiven that the normal case appears to work, I think the whole new config propagation is unnecessary (beyond doAs, queue, and file list verification).
