We had gone that route originally and were maintaining three different code drops for 0.17 (which we use in production at facebook), 0.18 which was a port requested by some external folks and 0.19 which was the hadoop version at the time hive was open sourced, and making these bug fixes and checking it into 3 different places was 3x the amount of work for the developers. Add to that, these branches would invariably diverge in the short term because the sequence of the checkins would not be the same, it became a big pain to port ones changes from one branch to the other because of the numerous merge conflict. So the solution for us, specially during this active phase of development was to have a single branch and compile it and run it with the different versions of hadoop.\n\nFor Hbase this probably works because they are perhaps a tad more mature at this point or at least have figured out the dependencies with hadoop to a large extent. It seems that they were also having a separate versioning scheme (different from hadoop) intially - I can hazard a guess that perhaps it was for the same reasons.\n\nAnyway, given the minor tweaks that were needed in the code to port it to 0.18 and 0.19, we saw this as the better of two evils.\n\nRegarding the unit testing template code - we have really taken the pains to ensure that the actual run time code is in QTestUtil.java and the velocity templates are just used to generate the front end junit test cases for different queries.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-09T18:29:03.483+0000","updated":"2008-12-09T18:29:03.483+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410280/comment/12654891","id":"12654891","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Perhaps I'm misunderstanding, but what I meant was a release schedule similar to what HBase uses.

This is also how Hadoop does it. So there would be very few patches of bugfixes to backport to a previous version of Hive. HBase also only supports the last two versions with new bugfixes, limiting how far back to port fixes.\nThis naturally forces people to upgrade to a recent version of Hadoop to get the latest Hive version but I don't think that's much of a drawback.\n\nPerhaps doing it differently in the early days of the project is ok, but it also sets a precedent that people are likely to follow further down the line.\n\nFrom the HBase wiki on the version numbering: \"Going forward, new releases of HBase will have the same version number as the Hadoop release so there will be less confusion over which release of HBase works with which version of Hadoop.\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johanoskarsson","name":"johanoskarsson","key":"johanoskarsson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johan Oskarsson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-12-09T18:49:51.055+0000","updated":"2008-12-09T18:49:51.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410280/comment/12654983","id":"12654983","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I would really like to see Hive be available for multiple versions of Hadoop.

The reality right now is that there are a lot of bug fixes and fixing them in all the 3 versions at the same time is too much of an overhead. Once we start cutting release branches, we would also follow the same methodology (which is quite standard) in that only blocker bugs get checked into the old branches, but right now, we have a number of those bugs which we want to get in before we embark on creating the first release. We do need an exercise to categorize those bugs - which I think we should do this week.\n\nOne thing we can do to alleviate some of the problems is to restrict the preprocessing to a specific list of files (right now there is only 1 file that needs this).
