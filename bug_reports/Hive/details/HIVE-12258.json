of the same table,\nit creates a deadlock. \nThe worse part is that once the deadlock is active, you can't query the table until it times out. \n\n* How to reproduce :\n\n\nCREATE TABLE test_table (id INT) \nPARTITIONED BY (part STRING)\n;\n\nINSERT INTO TABLE test_table PARTITION (part=\"test\")\nVALUES (1), (2), (3), (4) \n;\n\nINSERT OVERWRITE TABLE test_table PARTITION (part=\"test2\")\nSELECT id FROM test_table WHERE part=\"test1\";\n\nNothing happens, and when doing a SHOW LOCKS in another terminal we get :\n\n| lockid   | database  | table      | partition  | lock_state  | lock_type    | transaction_id  | last_heartbeat  |  acquired_at   |\n| 3765     | default   | test_table | NULL       | WAITING     | SHARED_READ  | NULL            | 1440603633148   | NULL           |\n| 3765     |

presents in 1.2.1.\nI could not reproduce it easily locally because it requires a pseudo-distributed setup with zookeeper to have concurrency enabled.\n\nFrom looking at the code I believe the problem comes from the EmbeddedLockManager method \npublic List<HiveLock> lock(List<HiveLockObj> objs, int numRetriesForLock, long sleepTime)\nthat keeps trying to acquire two incompatible locks, and ends up failing after \nhive.lock.numretries*hive.lock.sleep.between.retries which by defaut is 100*60s = 100 minutes.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"read/write
