A typical case would be like the following:\n\n{noformat}\n     inputRDD     inputRDD\n        |            |\n       MT_11        MT_12\n        |            |\n       RT_1         RT_2\n{noformat}\n\nHere, {{MT_11}} and {{MT_12}} are {{MapTran}} from a splitted {{MapWork}},\nand {{RT_1}} and {{RT_2}} are two {{ReduceTran}}. Note that, this example is simplified, as we may also have {{ShuffleTran}} between {{MapTran}} and {{ReduceTran}}.\n\nWhen multiple Spark threads are running, {{MT_11}} may be executed first, and it will ask for an iterator from the {{HadoopRDD}} will trigger the creation of the iterator, which in turn triggers the initialization of the {{IOContext}} associated with that particular thread.\n\n*Now, the problem is*: before {{MT_12}} starts executing, it will also ask for an iterator from the\n{{HadoopRDD}}, and since the RDD is already cached, instead of creating a new iterator, it will just fetch it from the cached result. However, *this will skip the initialization of the IOContext associated with this particular thread*. And, when {{MT_12}} starts executing, it will try to initialize the {{MapOperator}}, but since the {{IOContext}} is not initialized, this will fail miserably.
