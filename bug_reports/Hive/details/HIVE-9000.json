LAST_VALUE being last value should always be more (in terms of the specified 'order by s') than the lead by 1. While this doesn't directly apply to the above query, if the result set had more rows, you would clearly see records where lead is higher than last_value which is semantically incorrect.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"LAST_VALUE Window function returns wrong results","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mgrover","name":"mgrover","key":"mgrover","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Grover","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mgrover","name":"mgrover","key":"mgrover","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Grover","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12758685/comment/14249520","id":"14249520","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=navis","name":"navis","key":"navis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=navis&avatarId=19885"},"displayName":"Navis","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"body":"[~mgrover] I think it's correct.
