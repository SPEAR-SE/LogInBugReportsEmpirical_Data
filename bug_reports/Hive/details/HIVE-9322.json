We discussed the data vs key null-check as an aside.)\n\nAt the moment, the semantics aren't uniform across OIs. {{LazyBinaryMapOI}} and {{DeepParquetHiveMapOI}} already guard against null-keys, while the others don't. Wouldn't uniformity be best? In light of your performance concern, should we consider removing the null-checks in all MapOIs?\n\nI don't think we're changing semantics of what can be stored in a Map because I'd expect an NPE when writing a null-key (although I might be mistaken).
