This is needed for example when a pig job is submitted via WebHcat, and the Pig script uses HCat, which has to access metadata and thus the metastore.\n\nWhen the job is complete the delegation token should be cancelled.  HIVE-5133 implements it as an OutputCommitter but this requires relevant jars to be shipped to the node where TempletonControllerJob is run.  This makes configuration more difficult.\n\nSince Hive (and thus all the necessary jars for token cancellation) must be installed on the same node where WebHCat is running, the token can be cancelled from WebHCat when it receives a callback from Hadoop that the job is finished.  Thus no additional jars need to be shipped anywhere.\n\n
