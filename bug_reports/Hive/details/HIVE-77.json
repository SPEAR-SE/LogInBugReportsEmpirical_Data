I am assuming that log4j itself is multithread safe. The main issue is that all log events are going to end up in the same log file - and log entries from different sessions will be interleaved without any clear headers. There's something called NDC that's apparently used widely in multi-threaded environments to put prefixes on log entries per thread (in our case session). we can use NDC interfaces from log4j - but it's more work - potentially more disruptive changes.\n\nQTestUtil: don't understand this. today every query file is run independently in a different junit test. if QTestUtil ran all of them (either in sequence or in parallel) - this would not be possible. can u explain a bit more?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-01T23:05:44.285+0000","updated":"2008-12-01T23:05:44.285+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409031/comment/12652211","id":"12652211","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Log4j has a variable that will print the thread name. \n\nhttp://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/apidocs/org/apache/log4j/PatternLayout.html\n\n%t should do it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-02T00:10:32.993+0000","updated":"2008-12-02T00:10:32.993+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409031/comment/12652247","id":"12652247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=athusoo","name":"athusoo","key":"athusoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashish Thusoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@Joy\n\nI meant rolling up the TestMTQueries into QTestUtil so that we just have a single tool to deal with when it comes to query testing.\n\n%t as suggested by Edward should work for now.
