This could happen if the CLI got killed at any time between 1) and 2). \n\nAnother option is to use the traditional 'mark-then-delete' trick that you mark the partition as deleted on the metastore first and then clean up the data. In case of any failure, redoing the drop partiton will resume the data deletion process. It is also easier from the administrator's point of view that you can periodically check the metastore for deleted partitions (which are left uncommitted) and re-drop the partition.
