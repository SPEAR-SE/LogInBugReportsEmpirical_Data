   <name>hive.metastore.db.type</name>\n    <value>MYSQL</value>\n  </property>\n{code}\n\nSubstitute your DB name if it's not MySQL. Note that lower case mysql just won't do, it must be uppercase. Be sure to restart your metastore.\n\n(2) Use the right schematool invocation\n\nYou need to use dbType hive with the correct metaDbType + give it the correct JDBC endpoint to HiveServer2.\n\n{code}\nschematool -metaDbType mysql -dbType hive -initSchema -url jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000/default -driver org.apache.hive.jdbc.HiveDriver\n{code}\n\n(3) At runtime, add a bunch of JARs\n\nIn CLI you can use\n\n{code}\nadd jar /home/vagrant/hivedist/apache-hive-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/commons-dbcp-1.4.jar;\nadd jar /home/vagrant/hivedist/apache-hive-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/commons-dbcp2-2.0.1.jar;\nadd jar /home/vagrant/hivedist/apache-hive-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/commons-pool-1.5.4.jar;\nadd jar /home/vagrant/hivedist/apache-hive-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/commons-pool2-2.2.jar;\nadd jar /home/vagrant/hivedist/apache-hive-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT-bin/lib/hive-jdbc-handler-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar;\nadd jar /usr/share/java/mysql-connector-java.jar;\n{code}\n\nFor HiveServer2 you'll need to deal with AUX JARs or something like that.\n\n--\n\nAt a minimum it's important to eliminate Step (3) as it affects end users rather than being a one-time setup pain.\n\nThe second biggest pain I had personally was getting schematool to work right, this was largely because of missing validation checks that caused it to do things that had no chance of working.
