If we have binaries, they're supposed to be brought in as a download step during the compile or test-compile phase from a well-known published location such as a maven repository. The postgres jar we can depend on as a download, and it is an open source product that is compatible with the Apache License, but DummyDriver is worse, because there is no source attached to it either, which makes it not okay to include in the binary release of hive either.\n\nThus, for branch-1.2, I am going to do a git rm of those two jars right away. This, unfortunately, might cause a few tests added here to fail for branch-1.2, but this should be acceptable for the time being.\n\nI'm opening this jira to track the following:\n\na) git rm of the postgres and DummyDriver jar from master\nb) adding source code for DummyDriver into master, and changing the build so we depend on it being compiled, rather than included from test-resources.\nc) changing the postgres inclusion to a download.\n\nThis should also be applied to branch-1.2 after release, preferably before 1.2.1, so that future updates of 1.2 have this fixed as well.\n\nNote: In addition, there are two more jars added by HIVE-7553 which also need to have this same fix applied to them : ql/src/test/resources/SessionStateTest.jar.v1 and ql/src/test/resources/SessionStateTest.jar.v1 .
