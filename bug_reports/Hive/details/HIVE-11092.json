Initially I tried to use 'schema on read' but found some inconsistencies in the schema returned from the initial delta file and subsequent delta and base files. To reproduce the issue by example:\n\n{code}\nCREATE TABLE base_table ( id int, message string )\n  PARTITIONED BY ( continent string, country string )\n  CLUSTERED BY (id) INTO 1 BUCKETS\n  STORED AS ORC\n  TBLPROPERTIES ('transactional' = 'true');\n  \nINSERT INTO TABLE base_table PARTITION (continent = 'Asia', country = 'India')\nVALUES (1, 'x'), (2, 'y'), (3, 'z');\n\nUPDATE base_table SET message = 'updated' WHERE id = 1;\n{code}\n\nNow examining the raw data with the {{orcfiledump}} utility (edited for brevity):\n{code}\ncd hive/warehouse/base_table/continent=Asia/country=India/\n\nhive --orcfiledump delta_0000001_0000001/bucket_00000\nType: struct<operation:int,originalTransaction:bigint,bucket:int,rowId:bigint,currentTransaction:bigint,row:struct<_col0:int,_col1:string>>    \n        \nhive --orcfiledump delta_0000002_0000002/bucket_00000\nType: struct<operation:int,originalTransaction:bigint,bucket:int,rowId:bigint,currentTransaction:bigint,row:struct<id:int,message:string>>    \n{code}\n\nThe row schema for the first delta that resulted from the inserts has its field names erased: {{row:struct<_col0:int,_col1:string>}}, whereas the delta for the update reports the correct schema: {{row:struct<id:int,message:string>}}. I have also checked this with my own reader code so am confident that {{FileDump}} is not at fault.\n\nI believe that the row field names, and hence schema, should be consistent across all ORC files in the ACID data set. This will enable schema on read with field access by name (not index), which is currently not possible. Therefore I'd like to get this issue resolved.\n\nI'm happy to work on this, however after working through {{OrcRecordUpdater}} and {{FileSinkOperator}} and related tests I've failed to reproduce or isolate the issue at a smaller scale. I'd be grateful for some suggestions on where to look next.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"First delta of an ORC ACID table contains non-descriptive schema","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12840182/comment/14978476","id":"14978476","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=teabot","name":"teabot","key":"teabot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Elliot West","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Fixed by HIVE-4243 apparently.
