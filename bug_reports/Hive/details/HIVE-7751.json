But at runtime, the query can fail due to memory overhead issues. The improvement to prevent such failures would be to use table statistics instead of calling ql.exec.Utilities.getTotalInputFileSize() inside the CommonJoinTaskDispatcher. This would make sure that we take better decisions for MR mode. Tez on the other hand would handle such scenarios better because it actaully relies on table stats to get the data size.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"412498","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Mapjoin set in a non-conditional task  can fail in MR mode because of  memory overhead issues","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12734571/comment/14223741","id":"14223741","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Revisiting this issue.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hsubramaniyan","name":"hsubramaniyan","key":"hsubramaniyan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hsubramaniyan&avatarId=23453"},"displayName":"Hari Sankar Sivarama Subramaniyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-24T23:17:07.432+0000","updated":"2014-11-24T23:17:07.432+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-7751/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1yyq7:"}}
