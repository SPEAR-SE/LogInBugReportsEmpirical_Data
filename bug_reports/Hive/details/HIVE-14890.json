It turned out that some part of handler setup was inserted into an explain-related method (I don't know why) that was called for every query. Then thru some unrelated changes, the explain-related method was changed to only be called for explain queries (which is a logical change)... the end result was that handler was no longer configured properly and there was a bug that was hard to figure out.\nI stumbled upon this code and wanted to avoid a similar pattern here...
