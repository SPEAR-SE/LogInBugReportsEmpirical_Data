This was done since the number of tasks for large databases will generate a very large graph with hundreds of thousands of objects, this would put additional memory pressure on hive. \r\n\r\nThe execution hook's however still keep reference to the query plan which gets dynamically modified and at the end of all task execution hive will have the whole DAG in memory which is what we have to prevent, Additionally for PostExecution Hive hooks we are additionally storing the TaskRunner objects for each task that is executed. \r\n\r\nWe have to handle these issues to prevent excessive memory usage for replication specifically bootstrap replication.
