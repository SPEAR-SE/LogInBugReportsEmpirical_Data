If there is enough need for a 0.13.2, and someone ( maybe you? :D ) wants to drive that, then we vote on it, and go through the process.\n\nFor 0.13.1, soon after 0.13.0 was released, we hit several important bugs/breakages including a CVE that made 0.13.0 essentially unusable for some usage patterns. We fixed them in 0.14 trunk, but since it would be quite some time before a new stable hive release was released, we needed to make sure that the latest stable release of hive had those bugs fixed - this was what made 0.13.1 necessary. That bar of need, of having this bug fixed in this branch so that the latest stable hive has this fix, imo, does not exist for a 0.13.2 for this bug, since 0.14 is already out. That bar of need probably exists for 0.14.1, but you already have this checked in there.\n\nTo that end, for 0.13.1, I proposed that we have a 0.13.1 as a bugfix release in the hive dev list, volunteered to be the RM for it, got a bunch of +1s, and then proceeded to roll it out. If you think that this deserves a new release, then I would invite you to suggest to the hive dev list that a 0.13.2 be rolled out, and proceed with the same process I followed for 0.13.1.\n\nIf we were going through that process though, there might be a good point for a wholesale backport of a number of other bugfixes on 0.14.x to 0.13.2 as well, if there were enough people that wanted to upgrade from 0.13.1 to 0.13.2 instead of upgrading to 0.14.1.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-10T22:56:15.593+0000","updated":"2014-12-10T22:56:15.593+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760586/comment/14244811","id":"14244811","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Removing fix version tag of 0.13.1 from this jira, please feel free to add 0.13.2 when/if you get a community go-ahead for the same.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sushanth","name":"sushanth","key":"sushanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sushanth&avatarId=26812"},"displayName":"Sushanth Sowmyan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-12T21:36:35.515+0000","updated":"2014-12-12T21:36:35.515+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760586/comment/14244865","id":"14244865","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I don't think this JIRA is enough justification for doing an entire release on such an old version","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-12T22:04:45.010+0000","updated":"2014-12-12T22:04:45.010+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-9057/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2391r:"}}
