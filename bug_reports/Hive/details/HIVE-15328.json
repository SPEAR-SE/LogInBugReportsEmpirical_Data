Overview\n\nPerforming {{IS NULL}} checks against a null struct that is generated as part of a UDF correctly returns {{true}}. However, the same check against the same null struct that has been persisted to a table incorrectly returns {{false}}. Additionally, when a child field of the null struct is inspected in the same query, the result of the null check on the struct itself reverses itself to {{true}}.\n\nThe issue does not appear to be dependent on the storage format of the table as the same result is repeated with TEXTFILE, PARQUET, ORC and AVRO.\n\nh2. Example\n\nIn this example I have used {{if(1=1, null, named_struct('c', 1))}} as a crude method of generating a simple null struct.\n\nh4. 'b' is correctly reported as {{true}}.\n{code}\nhive> select\n    >   b is null,\n    >   b\n    > from (\n    >   select\n    >     if(1=1, null, named_struct('c', 1)) as b\n    >   ) as a;\nOK\ntrue\tNULL\n{code}\n\nh4. 'b' is correctly reported as {{true}} when also inspecting 'b.c'.\n{code}\nhive>\n    > select\n    >   b is null,\n    >   b.c is null,\n    >   b\n    > from (\n    >   select\n    >     if(1=1, null, named_struct('c', 1)) as b\n    >   ) as a;\nOK\ntrue\ttrue\tNULL\n{code}\n\nh4.
