which it opens on that file in readResults() and setupSessionIO() methods. This will result in leaking of file-descriptors. HiveServer2 has copy-pasted this code, so this leak occurs there too.\n\n* I am not sure about changes in SessionState per task. With your patch, each task will close the {{SessionState}} when it finishes. A query may have multiple tasks, so this implies every task will create SessionState when it begin executing, which seems counter-intuitive, since there should be one sessionstate object across all tasks of the query which was the case earlier too, isnt it?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-26T22:10:42.204+0000","updated":"2012-11-26T22:10:42.204+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617022/comment/13505047","id":"13505047","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Good points.
