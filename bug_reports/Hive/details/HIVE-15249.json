I have had to run schema tests, upgrade scenarios against 4 different databases installations that I may have missed this failure. \n[~massdosage@gmail.com] To me, it makes sense to remove this check and just have the JDO layer (or database layer in case of DirectSQL) enforce it. I will look into the history as to why this was put in place in the first place. Thanks for the suggestion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ngangam","name":"ngangam","key":"ngangam","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naveen Gangam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2017-03-01T20:35:13.228+0000","updated":"2017-03-01T20:35:13.228+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022106/comment/15901465","id":"15901465","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=massdosage%40gmail.com","name":"massdosage@gmail.com","key":"massdosage@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mass Dosage","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"[~ngangam] - agreed on the approach of removing the check if possible, good luck in digging into the history to find why this was added, we're very curious too!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=massdosage%40gmail.com","name":"massdosage@gmail.com","key":"massdosage@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mass Dosage","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2017-03-08T15:52:11.790+0000","updated":"2017-03-08T15:52:11.790+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13022106/comment/15942451","id":"15942451","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ngangam","name":"ngangam","key":"ngangam","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naveen Gangam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Fix for this issue has been included as part of a larger fix in HIVE-12274.
