I noticed that HadoopShims.checkFileAccess() returns void and indicates access-failures using exceptions.\nIn the use cases that were in mind when it was implemented, it is useful to have an error message detailing why the permission was denied. I would argue that isWritable() should also return an exception and we should log that in the error  that is getting logged when it returns false.\n\nRegarding the duplicate check in HMS, I agree we should at least have a config to turn it off. The purpose of adding it there i believe was to prevent cases where metadata change is made but it is not possible to make the file change.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-24T23:47:06.385+0000","updated":"2015-02-24T23:47:06.385+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12750935/comment/14338798","id":"14338798","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mithun] Can you please rebase this patch ?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-26T17:55:05.228+0000","updated":"2015-02-26T17:55:05.228+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12750935/comment/14338824","id":"14338824","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, [~thejas], will do.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-26T18:11:42.596+0000","updated":"2015-02-26T18:11:42.596+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12750935/comment/14342807","id":"14342807","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Rebased, and simplified slightly.
