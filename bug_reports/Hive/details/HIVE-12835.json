Documentation says they run from year 0 to year 9999 (\"depending on Java support\"). Tests I have done are consistent with supporting BC dates, but not identifying the dates as BC dates. Also there is some incorrect boundary handling. This is Hive 1.2.1 and Java 1.7.0_91.\n\nTo reproduce, create some table with 1 record and run these.\n\n{code}\nhive> select cast('2000-01-01' as date) - interval '2000' year from date_test;\nOK\n0001-01-01\n{code}\n\nSo far so good\n\n{code}\nTime taken: 0.067 seconds, Fetched: 1 row(s)\nhive> select cast('2000-01-01' as date) -
