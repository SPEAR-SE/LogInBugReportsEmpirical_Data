In fact, I prefer the platform independent code but I targeted to minimize the number of changes in my initial patches to get it working on Windows and avoid any regressions on UNIX. Let me explore the option to use code based archiving too. Is it ok if we address this in follow-up jira?\n\nThanks","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kannakar%40microsoft.com","name":"kannakar@microsoft.com","key":"kannakar@microsoft.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kanna Karanam","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-06-18T04:48:15.820+0000","updated":"2012-06-18T04:48:15.820+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12560540/comment/13395871","id":"13395871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=appodictic","name":"appodictic","key":"appodictic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Edward Capriolo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"If you think you need a follow up Jira please create one, but as this issue is concerned: Do not worry about minimizing the changes.
