So, we might want to add a bit to the PartitionWrapper(org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.metadata.Table,org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.Partition) ctor so that it's similar to the PartitionWrapper(org.apache.hadoop.hive.metastore.api.Partition,  PreEventContext) ctor, and then we can use a TableWrapper instead. Note that if the TableWrapper itself has a null sd, we have a potential failure condition - fetching using  context.getHandler().get_table_core is the right call instead of using a TableWrapper then.
