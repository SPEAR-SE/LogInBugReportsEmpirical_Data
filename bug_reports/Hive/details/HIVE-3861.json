I remember last time we had trouble with hbase integration on windows for which this thing was related.\n\nYou need the three slashes especially on windows. The RFCs require \"///\" (two for the authority, one to separate host from path). When you don't have a host that leaves \"file:///<path>\". On unix you typically get away with two, but on windows (\"C:...\") you need the third.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-21T08:52:45.772+0000","updated":"2013-04-21T08:52:45.772+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626204/comment/13637590","id":"13637590","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 will commit if tests pass.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-21T16:27:49.539+0000","updated":"2013-04-21T16:27:49.539+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626204/comment/13638083","id":"13638083","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashutoshc","name":"ashutoshc","key":"ashutoshc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashutosh Chauhan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Committed to trunk.
