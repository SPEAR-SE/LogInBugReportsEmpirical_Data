Gates","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This patch makes several changes in vectorization.  [~mmccline] and [~ashutoshc], as I am not very familiar with this code and as I know the code is very performance sensitive I would appreciate your feedback on the patch.\n\nThe issue causing problems was that VectorizedBatchUtil.addRowToBatchFrom is used by VectorizedOrcAcidRowReader to take the merged rows from and acid read and put them in a vector batch.  But this method appears to have been built to be used by vector operators, not file formats where columns may be missing because they have been projected out or may already have values set as they are partition columns.  So I made the following changes:\n# I changed addRowToBatchFrom to skip writing values into ColumnVectors that are null.  This handles the case where columns have been projected out and thus the ColumnVector is null.\n# I changed VectorizedRowBatch to have a boolean array to track which columns are partition columns and VectorizedRowBatchCtx.createVectorizedRowBatch to populate this array\n# I changed addRowToBatchFrom to skip writing values into ColumnVectors that are marked in VectorizedRowBatch as partition columns, since this results in overwriting the values that have already been put there by VectorizedRowBatchCtx.addPartitionColumnsToBatch\n\nMy concern is whether it is appropriate to mix in this functionality to skip projected out and partition columns into addRowToBatchFrom.  If you think it isn't good, I can write a new method to do this.  But that will involve a fair amount of duplicate code.  \n\n[~owen.omalley], I also changed VectorizedOrcAcidRowReader to set the partition column values after every call to VectorizedRowBatch.reset in next.  Without doing this the code was NPEing later in the pipeline because the partition column had been set to null.  It appeared that you had copied the code from VectorizedOrcInputFormat, which only called addPartitionColsToBatch once, but which never called reset.  I tried removing the call to reset but that caused other issues.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alangates","name":"alangates","key":"alangates","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alan Gates","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-17T22:59:01.994+0000","updated":"2014-10-17T22:59:01.994+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12748406/comment/14175914","id":"14175914","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\n\n{color:red}Overall{color}: -1 at least one tests failed\n\nHere are the results of testing the latest attachment:\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12675606/HIVE-8474.patch\n\n{color:red}ERROR:{color} -1 due to 1 failed/errored test(s), 6567 tests executed\n*Failed tests:*\n{noformat}\norg.apache.hadoop.hive.cli.TestCliDriver.testCliDriver_index_in_db\n{noformat}\n\nTest results: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/1332/testReport\nConsole output: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/jenkins/job/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build/1332/console\nTest logs: http://ec2-174-129-184-35.compute-1.amazonaws.com/logs/PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build-1332/\n\nMessages:\n{noformat}\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.PrepPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ExecutionPhase\nExecuting org.apache.hive.ptest.execution.ReportingPhase\nTests exited with: TestsFailedException: 1 tests failed\n{noformat}\n\nThis message is automatically generated.\n\nATTACHMENT ID: 12675606\n - PreCommit-HIVE-TRUNK-Build","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiveqa","name":"hiveqa","key":"hiveqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hiveqa&avatarId=17060"},"displayName":"Hive QA","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-18T08:17:22.021+0000","updated":"2014-10-18T08:17:22.021+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12748406/comment/14176496","id":"14176496","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mmccline","name":"mmccline","key":"mmccline","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046"},"displayName":"Matt McCline","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\nSome background on vectorization.\n\nThere are are \"shadow\" VectorizationContext data structures that track which columns of vectorized row batches for used by each vectorized operators.\n\nIn row-by-row mode an operator can easily form a new row Object Array to correspond to the outputObjInspector.\n\nHowever, in Vectorization we mask or project away columns in a VectorizedRowBatch (e.g. VectorFilterOperator) so the same batch can travel down the operators without being copied.  Or, in the case of computing new columns, VectorSelectOperator will compute new scratch columns.\n\nSo, the VectorizationContext starts as all the table columns for Map or the keys and values for Reduce and then as we go down the operators new VectorizationContext objects are cloned and their column and scratch column maps are modified.\n\nSo, some operators do not use inputObjInspectors or outputObjInspector.  Others, do use them when the vector operator unpacks batches into rows to call an row mode operator.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mmccline","name":"mmccline","key":"mmccline","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046"},"displayName":"Matt McCline","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-20T00:28:03.170+0000","updated":"2014-10-20T00:28:03.170+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12748406/comment/14176500","id":"14176500","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mmccline","name":"mmccline","key":"mmccline","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mmccline&avatarId=36046"},"displayName":"Matt McCline","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"\nI would prefer a clone of addToBatchFrom be cloned and chaged.
