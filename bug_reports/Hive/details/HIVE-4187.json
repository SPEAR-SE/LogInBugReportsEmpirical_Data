I do think that dependencies specified in fewer places leads to something that's easier to maintain.\n\nClearly we're incapable of maintaining the discipline necessary to keep these files up to date. What you're proposing sounds like the most pragmatic alternative. However, we should do this the right way instead of abusing transitive dependencies. Ivy has supported a parent descriptor inheritance mechanism since version 2.2 that would allow us to consolidate all of the submodule dependencies into a single parent file. More details are here: http://ant.apache.org/ivy/history/latest-milestone/ivyfile/extends.html\n\nbq. Having said that, I was simply jumping on this one first, because a broken build seems more urgent and I want to fix that right away. However, in order to do that I would like to know how your build is broken. Ivy should pick up the right version, the build machine doesn't have the problem and I can't reproduce it. Do you have any pointers?\n\nThe root cause of this problem is that Ivy and/or Ant is failing to enforce a deterministic ordering for elements in the generated classpath. This wouldn't be an issue if we managed our dependencies correctly, but obviously we don't:\n{code}\n% ant clean package\n...\n% find . -name \"antlr*.jar\"\n./build/ivy/lib/default/antlr-2.7.7.jar\n./build/ivy/lib/default/antlr-3.0.1.jar\n./build/ivy/lib/default/antlr-3.4.jar\n./build/ivy/lib/default/antlr-runtime-3.0.1.jar\n./build/ivy/lib/default/antlr-runtime-3.4.jar\n{code}\n\nVersion 3.4 is the only thing we should be retrieving, but because of a transitive dependency we're also pulling down 3.0.1 and 2.7.7. HIVE-4148 did not cause this problem -- it was already there -- but on my machine it seems to have caused Ant/Ivy to alter the way it orders elements in the classpath. I think it should be pretty easy to find the offending transitive dependency by looking at the reports in build/ivy/report.\n\nbq. A pure-red diff! Nothing better than removing code.\nbq. Nice! Nothing like a patch that is entire deletes\n\nI agree that removing unnecessary code has a lot of benefits. The problem is that HIVE-4148 removed metadata, not code. The metadata that was removed were statements of fact of the form \"module A directly depends on module B\". If we decide that we're incapable of adequately maintaining these facts on a per-module basis then I'm fine with using a global set of facts instead. I also have no objection to removing inaccurate facts. However, I strongly object to removing facts simply to make these files shorter.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwsteinbach","name":"cwsteinbach","key":"cwsteinbach","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carl Steinbach","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-17T04:18:37.144+0000","updated":"2013-03-17T04:18:37.144+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12637251/comment/13605072","id":"13605072","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hagleitn","name":"hagleitn","key":"hagleitn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hagleitn&avatarId=16035"},"displayName":"Gunther Hagleitner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I've tracked down why antlr 2.7.7 is included.
