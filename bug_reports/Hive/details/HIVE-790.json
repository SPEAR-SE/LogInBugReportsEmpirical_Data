So it is the second semantics. What you proposed is the first semantics, to implement which we need to move the statement to set the state to CLOSE to the beginning of the close() function (just after the check of the CLOSE state and return if true). \n\nWe need both both states since if we just have 1 state (CLOSE) and assign it in the beginning, if there are two parents to the operator, when the first parent call close(), this operator will set it state to CLOSE and just return without calling close() to all its children (since the other parent has not been closed). When the second parent call close(), it just return since its state is already closed. So this end up all children are not closed. We should not remove the CLOSE state checkup in the beginning since that may cause an operator being closed multiple times.\n\nWe cannot use just the CLOSE state as it is in the current implementation as well since the CLOSE state is set at the end of the close() function. When a parent calls this operator's close(), the parent's state is still not in CLOSE. So we end up just return and don't close the child operators. If we have the FINISH state and this state is set at the beginning of close(), whenever a parent calls close(), the parent is in the FINISH state and this operator can check and treat FINISH the same as CLOSE except that this operator hasn't return yet. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nzhang","name":"nzhang","key":"nzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ning Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-27T05:05:34.132+0000","updated":"2009-08-27T05:05:34.132+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433894/comment/12748265","id":"12748265","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nzhang","name":"nzhang","key":"nzhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ning Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This patch incorporated Zheng's comments. \n\nAlso changed the UnionOperator.processOp to synchronized.
