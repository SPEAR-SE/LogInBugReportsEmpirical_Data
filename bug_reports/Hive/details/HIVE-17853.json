At this point, {{close}} is called explicitly, followed by a call to {{open}} to establish a new connection. However, the reconnect call is not being performed in a doAs context, so it will create a new connection to the metastore as {{oozie}}.\r\n\r\nThere is no specific stack trace to attach here as it depends on the operations executed after the reconnect, and typically manifests as a failure caused by insufficient privileges. Worst case, if {{oozie}} has more privileges than {{mithun}}, it will successfully perform operations that {{mithun}} is not allowed to perform.\r\n\r\nAccording to the API, fetching the UserGroupInformation object can throw an IOException. I'm not familiar with the cases under which this would occur. However, I didn't want to fail immediately, because if the connection was initially established within a doAs, the calling code should have been able to establish a proper identity.
