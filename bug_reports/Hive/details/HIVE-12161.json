Could it be due to some Tez changes in new version? Will it affect real clusters? \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-13T21:42:24.986+0000","updated":"2015-10-13T21:43:47.674+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12904653/comment/14955831","id":"14955831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am looking at local repro...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-13T22:31:36.176+0000","updated":"2015-10-13T22:31:36.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12904653/comment/14955837","id":"14955837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Actually, nm, it looks like time difference locally is actually in the test...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-13T22:35:30.534+0000","updated":"2015-10-13T22:35:30.534+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12904653/comment/14986092","id":"14986092","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sershe","name":"sershe","key":"sershe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergey Shelukhin","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Fixed via session reuse.
