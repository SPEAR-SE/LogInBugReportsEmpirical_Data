After switching to hive 3.1.0 which uses orc 1.5.1 we've got an issue with predicate push down filtering out matching stripes by timestamp. E.g. consider a table (it's orc data is in the attachment):\r\n{quote}{{create external table test_ts (ts timestamp) stored as orc;}}\r\n\r\n{{insert into test_ts values (\"2018-12-24 18:30:00\");}}\r\n\r\n{{// No rows selected}}\r\n\r\n{{select * from test_ts where ts < \"2018-12-24 19:00:00\";}}\r\n\r\n// the lowest filter to return the value\r\n\r\n{{select * from test_ts where ts <= \"2018-12-24 21:30:00\";}}\r\n{quote}\r\nThe issue only affects external orc tables statistics. Turning ppd off with _set hive.optimize.index.filter=false;_ helps.\r\n\r\nWe believe it was the https://jira.apache.org/jira/browse/ORC-341, which introduced it.\r\n\r\norg.apache.orc.impl.SerializationUtils utc convertion is rather strange:\r\n{quote}public static long convertToUtc(TimeZone local, long time){\r\n {color:#cc7832}  int {color}offset = local.getOffset(time - local.getRawOffset()){color:#cc7832};{color}{color:#cc7832}  return {color}time - offset{color:#cc7832};{color}\r\n }\r\n{quote}\r\nThis adds a 3 hour offset to our timestamp in UTC+3 timezone (shouldn't it substract 3 hours, btw?).\r\n\r\nIf org.apache.orc.impl.TimestampStatisticsImpl is used with useUTCTimestamp=false, the timestamp is converted back in a compatible way via SerializationUtils.convertFromUtc. But hive seems to override default org.apache.orc.OrcFile.ReaderOptions with org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.io.orc.ReaderOptions which have useUTCTimestamp(true) in it's constructor. With useUTCTimestamp=true evaluatePredicateProto predictate is using  TimestampStatisticsImpl.getMaximumUTC(), which returns the timestamp as is, i.e. in the example it's \"2018-12-24 21:30:00 UTC+3\".\r\n\r\nAt the same time the search predicate is not shifted (the value in this tez log is in UTC+3):\r\n{quote}2018-12-24 22:12:16,205 [INFO] [InputInitializer \\{Map 1} #0|#0] |orc.OrcInputFormat|: ORC pushdown predicate: leaf-0 = (LESS_THAN ts 2018-12-24 19:00:00.0), expr = leaf-0\r\n{quote}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12953054","id":"12953054","filename":"000000_0","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=reimai","name":"reimai","key":"reimai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34050","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34050","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34050","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34050"},"displayName":"Rei Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-12-26T09:33:00.624+0000","size":224,"mimeType":"text/html","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12953054/000000_0"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Timestamp statistics in orc is wrong if read with useUTCTimestamp=true","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=reimai","name":"reimai","key":"reimai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34050","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34050","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34050","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34050"},"displayName":"Rei Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=reimai","name":"reimai","key":"reimai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=34050","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=34050","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=34050","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=34050"},"displayName":"Rei Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"timezone for both client and server \"Europe/Moscow\" (UTC+3) \r\n hive version 3.1.0.3.0.1.0-187","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/HIVE-21069/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|u00b0w:"}}
