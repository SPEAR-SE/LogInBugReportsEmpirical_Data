This was done because Path handles issues like some string representations have paths that start with \"/C:\" (result of Path.toUri().getPath()), while others have \"C:\" (Path.toString()). But once when Path comparison were introduced, I saw issues because given path in CombineFilter.accept(path) didn't have scheme but paths CombineFilter.filterPaths had scheme, and hence the change to make given path fully qualified in checkFilterPathContains.\nThough using Path makes the code more extensible (eg in case of query against files on different file system, scheme should be considered), I think it needs a more holistic change is required to use it (HIVE-3616).\n\nAs a quick fix,I think the code can be changed back to using strings instead of path, and change the way path in accept(Path path) is converted to string - (replace Path.toString() with Path.toUri().toString().)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=thejas","name":"thejas","key":"thejas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=thejas&avatarId=15902"},"displayName":"Thejas M Nair","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-09T04:05:07.076+0000","updated":"2012-11-09T04:05:07.076+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12615410/comment/13493770","id":"13493770","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gangtimliu","name":"gangtimliu","key":"gangtimliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gang Tim Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"OK.\n\nMaybe we revert HIVE-3483 first?
