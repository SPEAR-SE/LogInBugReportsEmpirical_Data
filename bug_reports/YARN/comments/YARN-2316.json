[I suspect some new added tests recently on Web-Services didn't do proper cleanup., Hi [~djp], I think there are two kind of possibility - 1. new added tests recently on Web-Services didn't do proper cleanup as you mentioned 2. infra change for Jenkins CI influences and the problem appear.

As I mentioned on YARN-2304, we don't support parallel test now because JerseyTest 1.9 doesn't support it. If the test run in parallel on single machine, it goes fail., Close this as dup off YARN-2304, because the cause of YARN-2304, YARN-2316, MAPREDUCE-5973 look same. Let's consolidate them and deal with on YARN-2304., +1 on resolving it as duplicated. It looks like these failures are all for the same reason.]
