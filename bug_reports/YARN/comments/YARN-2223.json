[looks like the some attempt data is missing . Can you find out the list of attempt files are under the state-store directory for application_1398453545406_0001 ? , we have fixed a few similar NPE on RM recovery problem recently. Probably this has been fixed in one of them. 
I'm closing this for now.  [~jonbringhurst], please feel free to reopen this if you still see this problem in latest build., Hey [~jianhe], that sounds good to me -- I haven't seen this problem in a long time. We're running 2.6.0 now.]
