[simple fix...adding no tests., lets add add a null check or else literally "null" will be printed if the diagnostics was null, If possible please modify some existing test or add a simple test. This will ensure that in future noone can inadvertently cause a regression that you spent a lot of time in debugging., Thanks [~bikassaha] ..
Added a null check and also updated test case which verifies both diagnostic message and exitCode., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
