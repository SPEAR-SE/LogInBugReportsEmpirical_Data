[cc:[~rohithsharma], [~bibinchundatt] As per the docs and my understanding this command needs to be run with hbase:

bin/hbase org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.timelineservice.storage.TimelineSchemaCreator -create

And the location of hadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice-hbase-2.9.1.jar needs to be added in classpath of hbase for running this command.

I referred to [https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/TimelineServiceV2.html#Enable_the_coprocessor] and was able to run this command successfully., [~abmodi]

I referred following documentation

https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r3.1.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/TimelineServiceV2.html#Timeline_Service_v.2_REST_API, Seems YARN-7378 got committed to only 2.9.0, [~bibinchundatt] sorry I missed checking the latest documentation. I think in this case, we should add timeline service folder to the Hadoop classpath. [~rohithsharma] or [~vrushalic] can confirm., [~abmodi]

https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/TimelineServiceV2.html#Enable_the_coprocessor 
Seems all the headers are lost too.. Could you cross check the same. , [~bibinchundatt] Yes all headers are lost.

But when I checked in branch-2 code headers are there. One change that I noticed is the extension. In trunk we are using .md extension while in branch-2 .md.vm extension is being used. Though I am not sure whether that is causing this., There is discrepancy in the documentation which need to be updated post YARN-7190. ]
