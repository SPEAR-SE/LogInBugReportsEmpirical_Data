[Thanks for the patch [~brookz]. 
I think we would have to consider the Localization Scope as well though. In case of private localizers, the {{LocalizerResourceRequestEvent::getVisibility()}} can be PRIVATE or APPLICATION. If it is application scope, the resource can technically be used by other containers of the same app, in which case, we should probably not endContainerLocaliztion.
[~jianhe], Thoughts ?]
