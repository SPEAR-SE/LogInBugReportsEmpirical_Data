[Patch to add diagnostics for finished apps.

This adds a new {{RMAppFinishedAttemptEvent}} class which contains the diagnostics from the finished attempt, but we could also repurpose the existing {{RMAppFailedAttemptEvent}} class.  The name would have to change to clarify its new role, e.g. RMAppEndedAttemptEvent.

I could see benefits of implementing it either way, so let me know if you prefer one or the other., Good catch, Jason!

Patch looks good too, it's better to keep the events separate like you did.

, Jason the patch does not apply cleanly to 0.23 could you port it?, Patch for branch-0.23.  Verified test case passes and manually verified on a single-node cluster with a fail job that the diagnostics appear on the RM page for the failed app., The new patch looks good.  Looks like it was mostly removing test code.  +1 thanks I'll pull this in now., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #388 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/388/])
