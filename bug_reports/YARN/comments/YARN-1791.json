[The distributed cache only preserves the basename of files and links them into the containers working directory.  If two names collide one can use the URI fragment to provide an alternative name for the symlink.  For example, hdfs:/a/b/c#d will be seen as "d" in the container working directory rather than "c".  If you require paths to be preserved then you can specify an archive (e.g.: .tar.gz, .zip, etc.) which will be expanded when localized and paths can exist within that.

In the future please use [mailto:user@hadoop.apache.org] for asking questions.  Apache JIRA is for reporting bugs and tracking features/improvements., Thank you Jason! I'll use that email for any further query.]
