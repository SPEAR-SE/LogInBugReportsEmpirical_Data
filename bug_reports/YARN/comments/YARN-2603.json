, This is not correct. We deliberately avoided putting compile time references to MapReduce in all of YARN.

You should instead use yarn.nodemanager.env-whitelist and set HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME while starting nodemanager.

OTOH, we are moving away from cluster installs of MapReduce to instead use DistributedCache: See MAPREDUCE-4421.

I am going to wait a couple of hours before reverting this., Given enough time elapsed since my comment, I reverted this from trunk and branch-2.

Will close this as Invalid in a day or two unless I hear otherwise., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6540 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6540/])
