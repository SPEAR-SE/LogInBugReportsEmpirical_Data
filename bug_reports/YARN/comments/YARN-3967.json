[Attaching the patch, At least for the YARN CLI, i think that right now we have this redirection. , Yes, the YARN client has this redirection built into it, but the web proxy isn't using that client., \\

This message was automatically generated., Fixed checkstyle and whitespaces, Thanks for working on this. [~mitdesai]. The patch looks good overall. Just one minor comment:
Could we create a common function for this
{code}
if (conf.getBoolean(YarnConfiguration.APPLICATION_HISTORY_ENABLED,      YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_APPLICATION_HISTORY_ENABLED)) {
    isAHSEnabled = true;
	    }

	    if (isAHSEnabled) {
	      try {
	        historyManager = getAHSProxy(conf);
	      } catch (IOException e) {
	        throw new YarnRuntimeException(e);
	      }
	    }
	    else {
              this.historyManager = null;
{code}
Since this piece of code is used in multiple place ?

This message was automatically generated., Refined the patch

[~xgong], I actually tried doing that before. But historyManager is a final member and cannot be initialiez outside. So it is not possible to make that change. There are 2 constructors for this class so initialization will have to be in 2 places., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~mitdesai] Ah, sorry for missing that...

+1 for the patch, checking this in, Sorry for the late arrival, can I get a chance to review?
, Committed into trunk/branch-2/branch-2.7. Thanks, [~mitdesai]., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8215 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8215/])
YARN-3967. Fetch the application report from the AHS if the RM does not (xgong: rev fbd6063269221ec25834684477f434e19f0b66af)

, I'm confused why we are not simply adding a separate explicit clause to catch ApplicationNotFoundException instead of YarnException.  Seems like it should just be:
{code}
    try {
      response = applicationsManager.getApplicationReport(request);
    } catch (ApplicationNotFoundException e) {
      if (!isAHSEnabled) {
        // Just throw it as usual if historyService is not enabled.
        throw e;
      }
      response = historyManager.getApplicationReport(request);
    }
{code}

This code also needs to be updated to handle the case when the appreport doesn't have a tracking URL and we got the report from the history server, as we will direct the user to the RM app page.  We already know the RM app page doesn't exist due to the ApplicationNotFoundException earlier:
{code}
      // fallback to ResourceManager's app page if no tracking URI provided
      if(original == null || original.equals("N/A")) {
        resp.sendRedirect(resp.encodeRedirectURL(
            StringHelper.pjoin(rmAppPageUrlBase, id.toString())));
        return;
      } else {
        if (ProxyUriUtils.getSchemeFromUrl(original).isEmpty()) {
          trackingUri = ProxyUriUtils.getUriFromAMUrl(
              WebAppUtils.getHttpSchemePrefix(conf), original);
        } else {
          trackingUri = new URI(original);
        }
      }
{code}
, bq. I'm confused why we are not simply adding a separate explicit clause to catch ApplicationNotFoundException
[~jlowe] This was to keep the implementation consistent with what the YarnClient does. If we want to make the change, I would suggest changing both YarnClient and AppReportFetcher to behave in a similar manner.

Nice catch. This is a rare case that should not happen in practice. I'll file another Jira to fix that issue., Created YARN-2975, * YARN-3975, Thanks for filing the followup.

That's unfortunate, since it's a convoluted way to handle the exception.  It's much clearer to catch the specific exception rather than the parent exception and rethrow it when it's not the specific one.  Even elsewhere in YarnClientImpl it does the right thing and catches ApplicationNotFoundException directly, see YarnClientImpl.submitApplication., Agreed. We should make the change in at both places than. I'll file a Jira for that as well., Filed YARN-3976, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #267 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/267/])
