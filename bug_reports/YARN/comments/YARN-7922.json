[This shouldn't be able to happen.  Distributed shell gets the renewer from {{YarnClientUtils.getRmPrincipal}} which calls {{SecurityUtil.getServerPrincipal}} to substitute _HOST.  Yet somehow the substitution did not occur.

The most conceivable, yet unlikely, way I see this failing is the principal has more than 3 components, ie. <REALM> contains another / or @, which would cause the substitution to short-out.]
