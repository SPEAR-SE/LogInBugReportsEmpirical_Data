[I looked into the problem and found that the root cause was that the default timeout for the rpc clients was infinite and moreover it was not configurable. This has been fixed as [~iwasakims] has made the rpc client timeout configurable in a later version. So I am closing this jira as a duplicate. Thanks to [~brookz] for cherry-picking HADOOP-11252 and validating that it resolves our issue.  ]
