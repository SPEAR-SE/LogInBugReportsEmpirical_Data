[Could you please provide me details ? I can not reproduce this error on my local environment. , This was happening on any application I just started and was running. I was just running wordcount at the time. What version are you using?  I haven't tried it on trunk or branch-2. , I was not able to reproduce this on a recent 0.23 build.  The yarn logs command simply returned nothing while the application was running.  After the job finished the same command dumped the logs.]
