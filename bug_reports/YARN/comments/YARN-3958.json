The code has tabs before {{.YARN_SECURITY_...}}. I'm +1 if that is addressed., [~ajisakaa], updated a new patch., +1 pending Jenkins. Thanks., \\

This message was automatically generated., Rethinking this issue, can we move YarnConfiguration.java to hadoop-yarn-common to fix the problem? If the patch is committed, Jenkins cannot run the test when yarn-default.xml is changed., [~ajisakaa],
Checked the test. You are correct.
But I think this would be a major change.
I have a concern that there might be some projects which might have induced dependency in their pom on hadoop-yarn-api because they want to use YarnConfiguration class. Pls note hadoop-yarn-api does not have dependency on hadoop-yarn-common in its pom.xml
Change can be made but this should go in branch-2 then ?

Moreover, realistically will somebody add a YARN related config in yarn-default.xml but not add it in YarnConfiguration class ?
I think unlikely. The reverse happens far more frequently.

So in branch-2 we can just move this test to hadoop-yarn-api and in trunk, move YarnConfiguration to hadoop-yarn-common.  Thoughts ?, Thanks [~varun_saxena] for the comment.

bq. Pls note hadoop-yarn-api does not have dependency on hadoop-yarn-common in its pom.xml Change can be made but this should go in branch-2 then ?

I understand. We cannot move YarnConfiguration class in branch-2.

bq. Moreover, realistically will somebody add a YARN related config in yarn-default.xml but not add it in YarnConfiguration class ? I think unlikely. The reverse happens far more frequently.

Make sense to me.

bq. So in branch-2 we can just move this test to hadoop-yarn-api and in trunk, move YarnConfiguration to hadoop-yarn-common.

I'll commit your latest patch in trunk and branch-2. Now I'm thinking moving YarnConfiguration to yarn-common in trunk makes little sense because it is unlikely that someone adds a config in yarn-default.xml but not add it in YarnConfiguration.java, as you said., Committed this to trunk and branch-2.
