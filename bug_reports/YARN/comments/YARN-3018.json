This message was automatically generated., hi [~nijel], 
below code in CapacitySchedulerConfiguration actually uses 0 instead. How about change it to be 0 ? and simplify below code to {{return getInt(NODE_LOCALITY_DELAY, DEFAULT_NODE_LOCALITY_DELAY);}}
{code}
  public int getNodeLocalityDelay() {
    int delay = getInt(NODE_LOCALITY_DELAY, DEFAULT_NODE_LOCALITY_DELAY);
    return (delay == DEFAULT_NODE_LOCALITY_DELAY) ? 0 : delay;
  }
{code}, Thanks [~jianhe] for the comment
Agree with you. Updated the patch with the changes, \\

This message was automatically generated., The test failure can be solved by changing the following lines in TestLeafQueue.testLocalityConstraints() 

-    verify(app_0,never()).allocate(eq(NodeType.RACK_LOCAL), eq(node_1_1),  - line number 2394
+    verify(app_0, never()).allocate(eq(NodeType.NODE_LOCAL), eq(node_1_1),  
         any(Priority.class), any(ResourceRequest.class), any(Container.class));
     assertEquals(0, app_0.getSchedulingOpportunities(priority)); 
-    assertEquals(1, app_0.getTotalRequiredResources(priority));        - line number 2397
+    assertEquals(0, app_0.getTotalRequiredResources(priority));

But i am not sure about the impact. Can any one help me in this ? , We should set it the other way round. The value in the config files is the right one (see YARN-408)., Thanks [~vinodkv].
I completely missed this JIRA.

Updated the patch to keep the value as 40., \\
