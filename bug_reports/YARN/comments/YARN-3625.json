This message was automatically generated., [~zjshen], this is a small bug that was found. The end result is that sometimes there are missing related entities. As a domain is required now, it is safe to say that a missing domain can represent an entity that is permitted to relate to. Checkstyle issue is existing for this method.

Jon, Hi, Jonathan! Would you mind give me an example to help understanding why the entity exists but the entity's domain is missing?

BTW, there's a special logic for LeveldbTimelineStore, where domain is implemented after the first version of store is done. So we need to to be compatible with the existing db data, which doesn't have domain. For RollingLevelDBTimelineStore, this shouldn't be a problem, right? We don't need the special treatment as well as the test case for it., [~zjshen], one difference between Leveldb and RollingLevelDB is in the way that batch writes are done. In LeveldbTimelineStore, each entity is processed and written to the db before the next. In RollingLevelDBTimelineStore, all entities in the put are processed one after then next, however they are written all together in one batch. This has created a temporary inconsistency for RollingLevelDB where related entities in the same put have the start time in the db, but nothing else until the last entity in the put is processed. To handle this scenario, I relax the domain checking to mean if a domain is non-existent we can treat this as if we are in the temporary state we have staged the domain to be written for the related entity but have not yet written it to the database.
Jon, Do have any more thoughts on this [~zjshen]?, bq. To handle this scenario, I relax the domain checking to mean if a domain is non-existent we can treat this as if we are in the temporary state we have staged the domain to be written for the related entity but have not yet written it to the database.

I see. What to do with the following case if entity1 of domain1 relates to entity2 of domain2, and they're put in a same batch? According to the patch, it seems that the relation will be allowed, right? However, we previously stop the relationship across domains., Check relationship between the entities in one put request shouldn't be a big additional cost. Perhaps we can pre check the domains of related entities in one batch, remember FORBIDDEN_RELATION if necessary, drop forbidden related entities, and then we can ignore the my aforementioned case in the later process. Thoughts?, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
