[Does the cluster have YARN-24?, No, this is a 0.23 cluster, and YARN-24 did not go into branch-0.23.

The problem is not verifyAndCreateRemoteLogDir, rather it's createAppDir.  That unconditionally tries to mkdir and setPermission each of the three log levels (user, user/logs, and user/logs/appID).  The mkdir isn't so bad since it already exists, but the setPermission always occurs and that causes a write operation on the namenode.  That's three write operations per application, per node.  In this cluster's case, that's a lot of operations due to the average number of nodes used by the applications and number of applications per day., Patch to walk back up the app log dir path to check for the existence of a directory before blindly proceeding to create it.  It gets out early if it finds a path that exists.

In addition to the unit test, I manually tested this on a single-node cluster verifying the directories are created iff they are missing and permissions are set iff necessary due to a too-restrictive umask., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I've noticed a new kind of HDFS integration failures recently. This time, it is caused by TestNNThroughputBenchmark exiting prematurely. Will file a jira if not reported already.]
