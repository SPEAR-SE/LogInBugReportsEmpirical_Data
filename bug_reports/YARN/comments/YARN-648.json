[Patch that documents the pluggable policies., Looks great.  Two comments:

We should probably keep some mention to hierarchical queues in the introduction. Maybe add on to the end of this sentence:
bq. Queues can be configured with weights to share the cluster non-evenly.
something like "and can be arranged in a hierarchy to subdivide resources within different pools*.

bq. affecting the scheduling latencies in other queues.
What do you mean by latency? A policy that is compute-intensive can still slow down things for everyone.  Would it be fair to say that it's more that we don't want to affect policies that are working working out fairness-wise for other queues?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Agree, I should probably leave out the latency and just leave it as configure appropriate policy.

However, I believe latency is also one of the reasons. Consider a configuration where root.a and root.b are to parent queues, configured to use fairshare and SP (a sophisticated scheduler with higher latency than fairshare) respectively. root itself has fairshare. Now, the apps under root.a don't suffer from the overhead of SP. Further, in the future, scheduling within a queue can be done asynchronously to achieve even higher throughput and the time to schedule an app depends on the cumulative latencies of parent queue schedulers? If I understand it right, Omega (Google) was built to handle such latencies in the presence of sophisticated schedulers.
