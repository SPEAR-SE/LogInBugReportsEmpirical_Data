[Where do you think is a good place to put the dump call? In the UpdateThread#run after the fsOpDurations.addUpdateThreadRunDuration(duration)  ?  (looking at trunk code). , Should be before {{fsOpDurations.addUpdateThreadRunDuration(duration)}} since {{UpdateThreadRunDuration}} should include all operation inside the update thread.]
