[ATS is only designed to support aggregation.  In other words, each new primary filter or related entity is added to what is already there for the entity.  You cannot remove previously put information.  In this example, I would expect oldprop and newprop both to appear., Agree with [~billie.rinaldi]'s comments above, this is expected behavior.]
