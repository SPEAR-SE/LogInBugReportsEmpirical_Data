Hey, Chen. Have you figured out why this happens ? I am very curious., I think it is because of mismatching during log parsing. I found this problem when I was running a Pig on Tez job running on Hadoop-2.4., bq. because of mismatching during log parsing

When we aggregates the logs into HDFS, we write the file_name and size of the files before we write the log contents.
When it tries to read back size of the log, but somehow the mismatching happens. That cause the exception.

Not sure why this can happen.
, If you take a look of the log aggregation, you may get some hint there.
What if the size of file is not right?, It is the same problem in YARN-1670., I looked at it. The problem is due to the corner case in the fix. I will file another JIRA to track the issue. Thanks [~airbots]]
