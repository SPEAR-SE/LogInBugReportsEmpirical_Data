This message was automatically generated., Sounds like a 2.7.1 blocker to me.., Tested my own version of this patch yesterday which does the same thing and works, so +1 LGTM, [~varun_saxena] the patch you had doesn't apply properly for me, I've uploaded a patch which does the same things which does, and which I've had the opportunity to test.

@xgong, can you take a look at this one (.0.patch)?  Thanks., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~cwelch], it has to do with line endings.
I have to run {{unix2dos}} to convert line endings for Jenkins to accept it. Windows batch files patches do not always apply depending on settings of line endings done by the user. I think my patch did not apply for you because of that reason., Use git apply -p0 --whitespace=fix could apply the patch.
The patch looks good to me.
