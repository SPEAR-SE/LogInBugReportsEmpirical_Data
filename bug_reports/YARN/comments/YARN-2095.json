[[~sunliners81], we have run much bigger jobs (100K maps) and those that run for long time without any issues. There is only one limitation that I know of - in secure clusters tokens expire after 7 days.

In any case, please pursue this on user mailing lists and create a bug when you are sure there is one. Closing this as invalid for now, please reopen if you disagree., Vinod, could you read the email below. Would you agree that there should be a log entry from Yarn in this case?

Clay,

What I noticed is that your reducers were overloaded and were on the brink of running out of memory. The Java heaps were running at 99% and continuously GC’ing while the app was reading from disk. So it was trying it’s best to process the job with limited resources. I agree with you that it would be helpful if the container could put out a log message that there was GC issues to help with debugging.

Thanks,]
