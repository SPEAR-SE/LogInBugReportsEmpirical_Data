[Did some investigation. Bellow is the summary:

1. Methods in Times can be integrated to Time (hadoop-common).

2. join and percent in StringHelper are duplicate with those in StringUtils (hadoop-common). It's better to combine them as well.

3. toAppID in Apps is duplicate with toApplicationID in ConverterUtils, The patch merge Times and StringHelpers to the corresponding classes in hadoop-common. Apps is combined with ConverterUtils., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
