This message was automatically generated., Hi [~gliptak], thank you for taking this issue. Would you create separate jiras for each subproject and split the patch?, [~ajisakaa] Done (I hope correctly ...)
, I think there is typically 3 reasons we would like to split the patch into different projects:
- We would like to see Jenkins result against different projects (HDFS, MAPREDUCE, YARN). 
- Committers actively on different projects can help to review different part of the code.
- The change, if involved with any bug, can be easily traced out through the patch history.
For small patch like this case, I don't see any necessary to split it into different sub projects. [~vinodkv], [~ajisakaa] and [~gliptak], what do you think?
, I agree, it makes committing process easier if we just have a single patch., Interesting...Where is patch? ;), [~djp] I just uploaded the patch again. It was split into the subtasks as per [~ajisakaa]'s request.

While I do not have vote here, I agree with [~djp], for a small patch like this, working it as separate items probably adds too much overhead ..., Thanks [~gliptak] for updating the patch. Latest patch LGTM. Also, I checked other reviewer's comments in YARN-3599 get addressed as well. 
+1 pending on Jenkins result. It could be one line or 2 slightly longer than 80 characters but if that is only complain together with no unit test, I should be fine., \\
