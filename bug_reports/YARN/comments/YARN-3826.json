This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~chengbing.liu] for the patch.

bq. Since we are calling setDiagnosticsMessage in nodeHeartbeat, which can be called concurrently, the static resync and shutdown may have wrong diagnostics messages in some cases.
I see diagnostics message is setting into resync/shutdown response objects before returning them. Can you give more details about a case where race condition could occur?

bq. these static members can hardly save any memory, since the normal heartbeat responses are created for each heartbeat.
I agree on this., [~devaraj.k], is it possible that two heartbeats happen at the same time? Because the following code
{code}
      shutDown.setDiagnosticsMessage(message);
      return shutDown;
{code}
is not atomic, race can happen when two threads run to this point simultaneously., Thanks [~chengbing.liu] for details., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~chengbing.liu], patch looks good to me overall except this comment.

The similar code is duplicated in three places, can you extract as a method something like below and invoke from those 3 places.

{code:xml}
  private NodeHeartbeatResponse getResponse(NodeAction action, String message) {
    NodeHeartbeatResponse response = recordFactory
        .newRecordInstance(NodeHeartbeatResponse.class);
    response.setNodeAction(action);
    response.setDiagnosticsMessage(message);
    return response;
  }
{code}, [~chengbing.liu], Did you get any chance to look into the above comment on the patch? Thanks, Sorry for the delay. I'll submit a new patch shortly., \\
