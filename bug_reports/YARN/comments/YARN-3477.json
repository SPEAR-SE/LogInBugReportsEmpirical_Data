[taking this on; urgent need to debug something...this code is going in for that anyway., {{TimelineClientImpl}} also catches InterruptedExceptions and either
# converts to IOE & so making it potentially treated as a retry
# during a sleep(), it will catch and discard.

Issue #2 means it is impossible to to reliably interrupt a thread which is in the attempt-and-retry process of trying to talk to a non-responsive ATS instance. While this does not impact normal operations, it does make it hard to shut down threads talking to ATS, Patch -001

# rethrows last received exception on a retry count failure
# caught InterruptedExceptions are converted to InterruptedIOException. This allows recipients to selectively look for that exception.
# no longer swallows InterruptedExceptions during sleep

There's no tests here, because there's no easy way to implement the failure paths.  Close review is encouraged.

There's one more thing we may want to do when handling the interrupts: re-enable the thread's interrupted flag. See [http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/j-jtp05236/] for the specifics here. I don't see any harm in doing this, and as it helps preserve the interrupted state, can only be a good thing, \\

# rethrowing runtime exception on timeout, but including the IOE as an inner exception
# using constant strings in the error messages
# clean up tests to (a) use those constant strings in tests, (b) throw the original exception on any mismatch, plus other improvements

moving back to an RTE is consistent, but makes it harder for callers to distinguish events like ConnectionRefused from other things. 

I would prefer the (incompatible) change of patch 001, speaking as one of the few people who have written an ATS client. Alternatively, define a specific RTE of "TimelineRetryTimeout" which apps can filter on -including these tests, \\

This message was automatically generated., This looks good to me. [~zjshen], can you look and do the honors?, +1 for unwrap the failing exception. Some thoughts and comments about the patch:

1. Shall we avoid throwing the runtime exception? Nowadays token operations can throw RTE to the caller, which makes a bit difficult for users to handle.

2. Do you think if it is better to change the log message level to DEBUG during the retry?

3. It seems we don't need to remember last exp, but throw it immediately if {{if (leftRetries == 0)}}.
{code}
189	        } catch (IOException | RuntimeException e) {
190	          lastException = e;
191	          // break if there's no retries left
192	          if (leftRetries == 0) {
193	            break;
{code}

4. You may want to update this test code like one of your other change.
{code}
108	    } catch (RuntimeException re) {
109	      Assert.assertTrue(re instanceof ClientHandlerException);
110	    }
{code}, Hi [~stevel@apache.org], thanks for the patch! The fixes on the timeline retry logic looks good to me. BTW, I agree with [~zjshen] that we may want to change some retry information's log level into debug. I used info level, but then found this may generate some noise in a log with retries. , Adding a little background (for timeline service v2) here why we could prefer DEBUG than INFO here in retry logic: 
In timeline service version 2, the timeline service address (per application per agent - we call it AppTimelineCollector) is automatically discovered, the current flow is: 
1. for a new application, when AM get launched in NM, the auxiliary service of container launch will trigger initializing of AppTimelineCollector, which report its bind address to NM (we add new RPC there); 
2. NM will notify RM about this new AppTimelineCollector address in next heartbeat; 
3. Other NMs (has container running against this app) get this address from RM.
Both AM and NM leverage TimelineClient to publish events/metrics info to timeline service and this auto-discovery process do need some time (several heartbeat intervals) to figure out rather than a static pre-configured address. And we will always see some disturbed info if we put INFO level message there. 
Thoughts? , -How about log @ debug except for that final rethrow event, when log @ info or even warn.
-Runtime vs IOE. I'd prefer IOException, we'd just need to update the tests and tag it as incompatible. If we retain the text then anything catching an exception and looking for the text would work from 2.6+, bq. How about log @ debug except for that final rethrow event, when log @ info or even warn.
+1. That's exactly what we want.

About Runtime vs. IOE, I agree with your comments above but would like to hear if any further comments from [~zjshen]. , bq. -How about log @ debug except for that final rethrow event, when log @ info or even warn.

debug @ retry and error @ final rethrow?

bq. Runtime vs IOE. I'd prefer IOException,

+1 for IOException, Cancel the patch for addressing the latest comments., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.1 into 2.7.2., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., GitHub user steveloughran opened a pull request:

, It would have really nice if this patch could have been reviewed and committed when it actually compiled against the code

as it is, it'll be a significant piece of work to try and merge in. I don't have the time this week, and am off on vacation from friday.

Can you look at the core changes: the exception logging, wrapping, {{nterruptedIOException}} rethrowing, and replicate that in your ongoing work? That's all that matters.

I'll watch your JIRA and review it., Sure. Let me find some time to finish this. Thanks [~stevel@apache.org]! , [~stevel@apache.org] I rebased your patch to the latest trunk. Here's the rebased version. , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Github user steveloughran closed the pull request at:

    https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/47
, repost patch 4 for YARN to kick off (maybe), sorry, missed this.

I've closed the PR, and have resubmitted the .patch. If yetus has decided that it's staying in github mode, the workaround is to create a new PR with the latest patch. Alternatively, go through all the JIRA comments and remove refs to github, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
