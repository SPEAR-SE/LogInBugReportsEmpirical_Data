[Thanks [~rohithsharma] for filing the JIRA. All of this makes sense. Capturing this information as metrics will help in this being aggregated upto flow run and flow level as well.
Also, we can make sure that the information which we serve from RM/NM REST endpoints currently can be published and hence served from ATS too (if the information makes sense as historical data)., Update the patch for publishing queue name and RMAppMetrics, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for the patch.
Overall the patch looks good.

# Suffixing each metric with _METRIC is not required as we are storing them as metric, so its self evident. Its just few extra unnecessary bytes being stored.
# Cosmetic comment - Maybe we can make the formatting of statements inside getTimelinelineAppMetrics consistent.

, By the way we should probably publish log aggregation status and diagnostics too. This will help, if user cannot find the application logs in designated location due to some failure during aggregation., Thanks for filing this issue and the patch [~rohithsharma]. It looks quite reasonable. Please address Varun's comments and we should be close.

Do we want this on the YARN-5355 branch only or on the trunk as well?, bq. By the way we should probably publish log aggregation status and diagnostics too. This will help, if user cannot find the application logs in designated location due to some failure during aggregation.
I think we should NOT store log aggregation status and its diagnostic information because of couple of reasons
# aggregated log will be deleted after some time as per configuration configured. Since we are storing very long history of applications, very old applications logs might be deleted which gives wrong information to reader. 
# Diagnostic report is for per node basis. This will over spam the application storage. Let say, if aggregation fails 100 nodes may be because of ticket, then full of application entity will be filled with list of nodeId vs diagnostic information. , Updated patch addressing other comments.. , bq. Diagnostic report is for per node basis. This will over spam the application storage. 
That's true. Agree with you.

bq. aggregated log will be deleted after some time as per configuration configured. Since we are storing very long history of applications, very old applications logs might be deleted which gives wrong information to reader.
I do not think it will give wrong information to reader because its just saying whether log aggregation had succeeded or failed. Deletion of aggregated logs is a separate functionality which admins would be knowing about. 
I just thought about this because for some applications which may have failed in last 3-4 days, we may look for their logs and if some logs were missing, log aggregation status and diagnostics info may have been useful. But without diagnostic info, we may not get much info on what went wrong anyways. Also, log aggregation status will not be immediately available i.e. when finished event is published. So even if we do publish it, we can probably handle it in a different JIRA.
[~sjlee0], your thoughts on this ?, Overall I am +1 on the latest patch pending Jenkins...
Will commit it later today unless there are further comments. This I assume needs to go in trunk. YARN-5355 branch, it can come to, when we do trunk rebase., Yes, this need to get committed in trunk. , | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
