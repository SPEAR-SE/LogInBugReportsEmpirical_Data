This message is automatically generated., Please update ApplicationMaster document saying we are not listening on the port. Also tracking url today is empty. Update the document saying distributed shell application master has no implementation yet to support web content via trackingUrl.

{code}+    appMasterRpcPort = NetUtils.getFreeSocketPort();{code}
remove this as we are not listening on this port.
Update test to check port==0., Remove rpcPort change, +1 lgtm. Thanks [~xgong], {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. +  private int appMasterRpcPort = -1;
why?, Latest patch looks good. Can you debug why TestDistributedShell works with patch #6 but not with #7 ?, [~vinodkv] We can set appMasterRpcPort as -1. Because there is the parameter check for AMRMClientImple.

{code}
Preconditions.checkArgument(appHostPort >= 0,
        "Port number of the host should not be negative");
{code} , Can not set the port as -1, Change parameter check for AMRMClient to allow -1, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
