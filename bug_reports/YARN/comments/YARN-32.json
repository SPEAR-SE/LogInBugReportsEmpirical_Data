        at org.junit.runners.BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.runChild(BlockJUnit4ClassRunner.java:49), Shortened the max idle time to remove lingering connection threads., Robert/Thomas, can you comment on why the test was failing in the first place and what the fix is supposed to do? Tx., Vinod I could reproduce this issue on jdk6 when I reversed the order of the tests.  The default ipc.client.connection.maxidletime is 10 seconds' so the connections hang around after shutdown and get used by the next test. , Okay, instead of depending on the maxidletime, how about closing the client explicitly in each test?
{code}
  rpc.stopProxy(rmClient, conf)
{code}
You can do that in the finally block of each test., Both tests explicitly stop the proxy currently.  From my investigation, the current implementation does not kill the IPC threads until the max idle time has expired. , Does this patch work for you?

I generally resist putting in test-delays / hard-coded sleeps., Vinod,  Thanks for the patch.  It is much cleaner and the tests pass for JDK6 and JDK7.  , Thanks for the confirmation, Robert.
