[analyzing the cause. Will post the analysis/fix soon, Attaching the patch for trunk and branch2, While cleaning up the containers,
{code}
while (cleanedSize < allocatedSize && waitCount++ < 200) {
  Thread.sleep(100);
  resp = nm.nodeHeartbeat(true);
  cleaned = resp.getContainersToCleanup();
  cleanedSize += cleaned.size();
}
{code}

The test sometimes cannot do the complete cleanup and some of the 10000 containers cannot be cleaned up. Resulting an assertion error at {{Assert.assertEquals(allocatedSize, cleanedSize);}}.

This test has been failing in our nightly builds since couple of days. I was able to reproduce this consistently on eclipse but not using maven. I think this is an environment issue so cannot be reproduced everywhere.

As a fix, I have increased the thread sleep time in the while loop. Which will give some extra time for the container cleanup. And as there is also a check in the while loop for the allocated size and cleaned size, the test will not always take up all cycles in the loop., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch makes sense to me. I tried the test in eclipse as well. Sometimes it would be failed after 200 rounds of node heartbeat, and the container still haven't completed cleaned up.

However, is it a better code practice to loop until all the containers are cleaned up (removing the 200 round bounds), and set a suitable timeout for this test case?, +1 for the change.

bq. However, is it a better code practice to loop until all the containers are cleaned up (removing the 200 round bounds), and set a suitable timeout for this test case?
The unit tests do not always run in a controlled environment, so timing can vary widely. Tight timeout or timing-based performance checks are not recommended in unit tests., Thanks, Mit for working on the patch. I've committed this to trunk and branch-2., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5475 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5475/])
