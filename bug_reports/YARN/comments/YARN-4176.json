[Hi [~bibinchundatt], 
Seems like this would be a better idea than what we did in YARN-4106, where in we used time interval of 1 min only on NM side failure. But i have few concerns/queries :
# I would suggest only to have only 1 resync configuration and remove what we introduced for YARN-4106.
# So node labels will be sent to RM either if node labels are modified since the last heartbeat or the resync-interval has elapsed right ?
# Earlier the way used to check the time elapse is using {{System.currentTimeMillis()}}, but i think we need to use the approach as mentioned by [~stevel@apache.org] in the [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-12409?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel&focusedCommentId=14745056#comment-14745056] of the jira HADOOP-12409. Hope [~xinxianyin] creates a new jira and provide a clock with monotonic time by then, if not use  {{System.nanoTime()}}.
, Hi [~Naganarasimha]
Thnks for the comments.

Will be taken care

{quote}
Currently on hearbeat we are sending only when update happens.  Will be *or* of update & resync.
Changing to {{System.nanoTime()}} will handle too., I no longer trust nanoTime(). I'll do a blog post on it, but the summary is: on multi-core/multi-socket systems you may get either inconsistent results or time data from a clock that is even less granular than getTimeMillis, [~stevel@apache.org],
 Thanks for the comments, but based on the earlier comment 
bq. Clock-wise, how about adding a new method, `monotonicTimeMillis()`, which is just nanoTime/1e6; easy to switch from one to the other.
i thought by {{nanoTime/1e6}} you meant {{System.nanoTime()/1000000}}, which is similar to the modification which you had asked to [refer|https://github.com/apache/incubator-slider/blob/develop/slider-core/src/main/java/org/apache/slider/common/tools/Duration.java] but if that also is inconsistent, then any other option ?

[~bibinchundatt],
Missed one more point let the interval configuration name be {{yarn.nodemanager.node-labels.resync-interval-ms}} , as  configurations after provider was used only for config and label based provider., Attaching patch for review.

# Have taken care of configuration naming .

This message was automatically generated., Checkstyle issues not added as part of this patch to my understanding, Hi [~bibinchundatt],
Thanks for working on the patch. Few comments :
NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.java
# {{diffcheckstylehadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager.txt}} seems like issues reported here are related to the modifications of the patch
# {{areNodeLabelsUpdated || resyncElapsed}} could be {{areNodeLabelsUpdated || isResyncIntervalElapsed()}}, In the cases where node labels are updated then due to short circuit isResyncIntervalElapsed will be avoided
# in {{isResyncIntervalElapsed}} resyncInterval  need not be evaluated on every call we can push this to constructor or init

{noformat}
I feel can be skipped as already the number of lines were greater than 2K, Hi [~leftnoteasy]

Could you please look into this issue, Thanks [~bibinchundatt] for working on this issue, few small nits remaining :
# {{nodeLabelsProvider}} and {{resyncInterval}} can be final
# {{lastNodeLabelSendMills}} needs to be set even in case validation fails this will avoid invalid labels to be validated for every heartbeat
# In TestNodeStatusUpdaterForLabels, {{dummyLabelsProviderRef.setNodeLabels(toNodeLabelSet("P1"));}} can be outside the for loop and {{assertNull("Null resourcelabels are expected", resourceTracker.labels);}} is not required in side the if check.
# Modify {{updatedLabelsSentToRM}} -> areLabelsSentToRM
# instead of logging on every resync in {{verifyRMHeartbeatResponseForNodeLabels}} we can either make it debug log or based on labels update/RM reject we can log. I prefer for the former approach.

Apart from this every thing else is fine and have tested the patch in the cluster
[~wangda] we have kept the sync interval as 2 mins so that when cluster nodelabels are added, NM HB can update latest labels fast, please share weather we need to increase this sync duration to a greater value like 10 mins. 
, Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for comments

{quote}
 increase this sync duration to a greater value like 10 mins.
{quote}
The udpate interval is 10 mins so resync should be less than 10.

Patch lgtm, +1., [~bibinchundatt], one question when looking at the patch, do you think is this patch can completely replace what YARN-4106 can do. If so, is it make sense to revert YARN-4106?, Hi [~leftnoteasy]

YARN-4106 the Timer related fix for loading conf every interval is done.
So this jira cann't completely replace the same.

Only the heartbeat resend is common between both the jira's. YARN-4106 only failed we used to handle in this failed or success we are sending label along with heartbeat., Hi [~wangda] and [~bibinchundatt],
Can we just hold on to this getting committed as we need to see the cluster Node Labels being removed holistically including changes in YARN-3964.
