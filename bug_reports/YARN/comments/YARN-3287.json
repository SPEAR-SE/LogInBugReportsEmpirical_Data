This message is automatically generated., One concern: moving ugi computation into init will make the client only work for the user who inits it. It cannot be shared with the other users. For example, if RM want to reuse one client to publish data on behalf of different application users., Btw, {{getAuthenticationMethod() == UserGroupInformation.AuthenticationMethod.PROXY}} is equivalent to {{realUgi != null}}, right?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~zjshen], the cache ugi is to mach the usage of other clients such as dfsclient. In this case, there is a latent bug that is fixed that prevents makes you think that reusing a client in different doAs contexts is correct. However, the delegation token is only valid for the initial connection. The tests are modified to show this correct usage. Daryn mentioned the realUgi != null can be a better check since the PROXY word can be manipulated by some scenarios that will cause it to fail.

Patch is up and runs successfully on my box. I have reused the minikdc access the parameterized run to cut the test time down considerably.

Jon, Thanks for updating the patch. I'll check it out. BTW, I guess this patch has conflicted with YARN-3227., [~zjshen], I have posted a patch that should apply successfully.

This message is automatically generated., [~zjshen], can you have another looks now that I have up-merged and added sufficient tests to test this change?, Sure, I'll take a look again., I double checked the oozie use case. It seems that for each individual job, oozie server will create a separate client to start the MR job. The change should be safe then.

Thanks for the patch, Jon! It's almost fine to me. Just one nit.

1. In private ClientResponse doPosting(Object obj, String path), doAs op will throw UndeclaredThrowableException, shall we capture and unwrap it as before.

332	    } catch (InterruptedException ie) {

, It breaks the timeline access control of distributed shell. In distributed shell AM:

{code}
    if (conf.getBoolean(YarnConfiguration.TIMELINE_SERVICE_ENABLED,
      YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_TIMELINE_SERVICE_ENABLED)) {
      // Creating the Timeline Client
      timelineClient = TimelineClient.createTimelineClient();
      timelineClient.init(conf);
      timelineClient.start();
    } else {
      timelineClient = null;
      LOG.warn("Timeline service is not enabled");
    }
{code}

{code}
      ugi.doAs(new PrivilegedExceptionAction<TimelinePutResponse>() {
        @Override
        public TimelinePutResponse run() throws Exception {
          return timelineClient.putEntities(entity);
        }
      });
{code}

This Jira changes the timeline client to get the right ugi at serviceInit, but DS AM still doesn't use submitter ugi to init timeline client, but use the ugi for each put entity call. It result in the wrong user of the put request., Should I file a JIRA to correct the distributed shell., Have filed YARN-3522 already., Pulled this into 2.6.1. Ran compilation and TestTimelineAuthenticationFilter before the push. Patch applied mostly cleanly, except for a minor conflict in TimelineClientImpl.
