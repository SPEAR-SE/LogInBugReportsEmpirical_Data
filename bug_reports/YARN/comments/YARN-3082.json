{noformat}, Attaches patch that ensures ByteBuffer which ends up getting shared by different concurrent nodeheartbeats, is converted properly.
Unit test , Looks good to me overall. Minor nits:

{code}
+    }
+    finally {
+      threadPool.shutdownNow();
{code}

This finally statement should be moved after a brace in the line like this:

{code}
    } finally {
      threadPool.shutdownNow();
{code}
