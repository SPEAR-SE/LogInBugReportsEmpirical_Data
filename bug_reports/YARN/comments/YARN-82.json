[+1, can one of you take a stab at it. While you are at it, can you please also address any other hard-coded temp paths like this? Thanks., Let's be careful, we don't need to introduce explicit deps on configs from HDFS/MR. Let's keep a separate namespace., bq. Let's be careful, we don't need to introduce explicit deps on configs from HDFS/MR. Let's keep a separate namespace.
Thanks for the idea, Arun. Can you suggest a good name or existing variable I should depend on?, Arun, assume it is ok to add deps on configs in Common (i.e core-site), but not with Mapreduce/HDFS. Is that correct ?, Hemanth - yes, agreed.

Btw, great to see you around! :), Andy, I have a patch for this. Is it OK if I assign this JIRA to myself and upload the same ?, Attaching a patch which seems to work for me. Andy / others, would be good if you can review and let me know if its ok.

I've changed the following two properties in the patch:
yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs now points to ${hadoop.tmp.dir}/nm-local-dir
yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs now points to ${yarn.log.dir}/nm-logs.

The latter is an incompatible change. The default value was /tmp/logs. However, since this was logs, I thought it was better to default to yarn.log.dir. Let me know if this is fine.

The other directory based configuration is yarn.nodemanager.remote-app-log-dir. However, since this is a location on HDFS typically, it seems better not to default it to variables that point to local logs., bq. Andy, I have a patch for this. Is it OK if I assign this JIRA to myself and upload the same ?

Definitely! Thanks for the patch.

+1, I agree with the change to yarn.log.dir.  Someone who understands the YARN requirements should review as well., Thanks for the patch, Hemanth., log-dirs could be ${yarn.log.dir}/app-logs or even ${yarn.log.dir}/userlogs like in 1.0 ?, since the property is used to configure the log location for containers run on behalf of a user., Modified the patch per Sid's comments. I have changed the default to userlogs - to be similar to what was there in 1.x. , +1. Committing this. Thanks for the patch Hemanth, and Andy for the review., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2814 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2814/])
