[Hi [~eepayne], thanks for working on this. It has been hanging there for a while, so I'm just writing to check if there are some recent updates on this JIRA? Thanks! , Thanks, [~gtCarrera9], for your interest. Although I haven't made much progress on this yet, I do still plan on working on it in the near future., [~jlowe], this patch makes the "Recovering localized resource" message a debug message. Would you like to take a look?, \\
