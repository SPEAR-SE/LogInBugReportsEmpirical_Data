This message was automatically generated., Test case failures are unrelated to this patch., Thanks [~sunilg] for the patch.. The patch mostly looks good to me.. Have you verified in the real cluster?, Thank you [~rohithsharma]
Yes. I have verified this in real cluster. I will upload few screen shots later., Rebasing the patch as YARN-4014 is committed. 
Verified all cases in a real cluster also.

This message was automatically generated., Test case failures are not related., Hi [~rohithsharma]
Could you please take a look on this patch., Hi [~sunilg], IIUC intention of this jira is to show in the ATS UI with the modifed queue or priority if any right ?. If so it requires modification in {{ApplicationHistoryManagerOnTimelineStore.convertToApplicationReport}} needs to capture the event {{ApplicationMetricsConstants.UPDATED_EVENT_TYPE}} and update the ApplicationReport object. At the same time we need to ensure that if multiple application updates are done then we need to show the latest update in the UI. As per the logic what i  see in {{LeveldbTimelineStore.getEntity(String, String, Long, EnumSet<Field>, LeveldbIterator, byte[], int)}} seems like all the events are captured and returned in which case we need to check return the report with the information present in latest {{ApplicationMetricsConstants.UPDATED_EVENT_TYPE}} , Thank You [~Naganarasimha] for sharing the comments.

bq.ApplicationHistoryManagerOnTimelineStore.convertToApplicationReport needs to capture the event ApplicationMetricsConstants.UPDATED_EVENT_TYPE 
I feel this is not needed. We are already not handling {{ACLS_UPDATED_EVENT_TYPE}} also. I think we use different handling in {{convertToApplicationReport}} for CREATED_EVENT_TYPE and FINISHED_EVENT_TYPE to record appStarted time and appFinished time (plus few other finished details)
I used {{entityInfo}} to store Queue and Priority details. Hence the first part of code in {{convertToApplicationReport}} covers reading that details and will fed to {{ApplicationReportExt}} object.  Please share your opinion.

bq.we need to check return the report with the information present in latest ApplicationMetricsConstants.UPDATED_EVENT_TYPE
One doubt here. We already are using {{EnumSet.allOf(Field.class)}} in {{ApplicationHistoryManagerOnTimelineStore.getApplication}} and hence it has {{LAST_EVENT_ONLY}} field. So we will read the last saved entity. Please help to correct me if I am wrong., [~sunilg], As per the offline discussion we had, currently you are populating the entityInfo Object with the modified priority or the queue because of which ATS is able to provide the updated info. So yes both of my queries gets answered with it . But one point which i can think of here is would it be better to capture the modified priority and queue (if any) as part of eventInfo ? so that initial submission information as well as modification information will be captured which might be helpful later in analysis. , Thank you [~Naganarasimha Garla] for the input.

Idea of publish each app changed event  (priority/queue) is good. But current V1 GUI doesnt have support to display all changed entities of application in UI. I discussed with [~jianhe] also offline. As per our discussion, we need not need to concentrate on showing this changed entities in UI now. It will make current UI complex. In future UI work, we can handle this in a better human readable form (application timelilne graph maybe). However we can have changed events  in YARN level rather than entity overwrite, and we can show last changed event for now. I will update a patch based on this understanding., Thanks for the update [~sunilg], 
My thoughts initially was also same but may be I could have conveyed better, i meant it would good for analysis if atleast if application updates are captured in ATS and my intention was not to show in UI., Uploading a newer version.

AppUpdated changes are now made as a TimeLine event. As app updated event can come separately for priority and queue (in future may be more), we only have a single event to report for these changes in common. Hence ordering events based on last value is not needed for now. As we properly handle AppReport creation always from last event, i think its fine for now. [~Naganarasimha Garla] pls let me know your thoughts., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~sunilg],
I think overall the patch is fine just for few nits :
# In {{ApplicationHistoryManagerOnTimelineStore}} if check is not required as in any case we filling both Priority and QueueName when there is appupdate event.
# We need to update the test case for {{ApplicationHistoryManagerOnTimelineStore}} modifications , Thank you Naga for the comments.
Yes, for now we are setting all information's such as queue/priority always. Hence that if check can be removed. Added tests also. Uploading a new patch., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~sunilg],
Thanks for updating the patch, few nits
# As discussed earlier, we are depending on one of the feature of HistoryServer to return the latest event. So it would be better to cover in our test case as, if there is break in that feature our testcase can catch it. i.e to add additional events modifying the queue / priority (may be one modification for queue and other for Priority). 
# ApplicationUpdatedEvent has overridden {{hashCode}} but not {{equals}}. In the first place do we require to over ride the hashcode method ?, Hi [~Naganarasimha Garla]
Yes. we can add more events in test case to verify the order, this can be done. I will update.
As I see point 2, all {{SystemMetricsEvent}} are overriding {{hashCode}} along with the new {{ApplicationUpdatedEvent}}. And if you see {{AppAttemptRegisteredEvent}}, there also the hashCode is overridden with *appId*, not *appAttemptId*.
{code}
 @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return appAttemptId.getApplicationId().hashCode();
  }
{code}
Also sharing code snippet from {{ContainerCreatedEvent}}
{code}
  @Override
  public int hashCode() {
    return containerId.getApplicationAttemptId().getApplicationId().hashCode();
  }
{code}

So the intention looks like is to treat all {{SystemMetricsEvent}} similar I feel. [~rohithsharma] thoughts?, Thanks for pointing out [~sunilg], Now i recollect why its like that, its because of {{CompositEventHandler in MultiThreadedDispatcher}} which is used to dispatch the events in multiple threads and all the events related to a given app they want to send it in one thread. And equals we cannot ensure using appid hence equals is not overwritten. I feel the design is not appropriate here but anyway i am modifying the design so modifications in your current patch should for it should be ok., Thank you.
