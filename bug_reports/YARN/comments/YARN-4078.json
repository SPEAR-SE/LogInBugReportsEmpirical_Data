[Recently in ApplicationMasterService similar issue got fixed YARN-3986. Could you please verify anywhere else such issues are exist so that all together can be combined, discussed and fixed in the same JIRA?, In the main code, its guarded at places other than the issue raised here. , Yes  [~rohithsharma] & [~varun_saxena], In most of the places its handled and except in these 2 places its type casted ( but in AppInfo is unguarded). But the point is why need to even have guarded check cant we expose both the methods ({{getPendingResourceRequestForAttempt}}  &  {{getApplicationAttempt}} ) in {{YarnScheduler}} ?, {{getApplicationAttempt}} is specific to {{AbstractYarnScheduler}}, {{getPendingResourceRequestForAttempt}} was introduced as part of YARN-3262, so we need to only move {{getPendingResourceRequestForAttempt}} or have a guarded check, [~jianhe] can you share your thoughts on this, Moving the {{getPendingResourceRequestsForAttempt}} method to the YarnScheduler interface and also updating the testcases with removing typecasts to AbstractYarnScheduler whereever not required, submitting the patch. [~jianhe] / [~rohithsharma] can one of you review it ?, thanks [~Naganarasimha], 
- type cast not needed in TestWorkpreservingRMRestart and TestAbstractYarnScheduler
{code}
    YarnScheduler scheduler =
        (YarnScheduler) rm2.getResourceScheduler();
{code}
- I think we can expose a getApplicationAttempt in the scheduler interface which is more general and so getPendingResourceRequestForAttempt need not be exposed? , \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~jianhe],
Thanks for the review, will correct the first point but for the second one i have few queries
bq. I think we can expose a getApplicationAttempt in the scheduler interface which is more general and so getPendingResourceRequestForAttempt need not be exposed?
I had considered this before refactoring but there are following problems :
* {{SchedulerApplicationAttempt}} (or its subclasses) which is returned by {{AbstractYarnScheduler.getApplicationAttempt}} is currently with {{private}} annotation. so was not sure with exposing it under the public interface {{YarnScheduler}}
* Currently AbstractYarnScheduler definition is {{AbstractYarnScheduler <T extends SchedulerApplicationAttempt, N extends SchedulerNode>... }}, Also generics used here was very much linked with lot of classes and method inside. So was not sure whether its good idea to push this getApplicationAttempt method from {{AbstractYarnScheduler  to YarnScheduler}}, [~jianhe], Updating that patch with removal of unnecessary castings and some white space issue reported by jenkins.  , \\
