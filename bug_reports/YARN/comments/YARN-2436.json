[Specifically from the old code:

{code}
elif [ "$COMMAND" = "application" ] ||
     [ "$COMMAND" = "applicationattempt" ] ||
     [ "$COMMAND" = "container" ]; then
  CLASS=org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.cli.ApplicationCLI
  YARN_OPTS="$YARN_OPTS $YARN_CLIENT_OPTS"
  set -- $COMMAND $@
{code}, Simple one line fix., Patch lgtm. +1. 

Tested $ yarn application help;  without the patch doesn't work, and with the patch works., Committed to trunk., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6093 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6093/])
