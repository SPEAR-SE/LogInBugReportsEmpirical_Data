[From my investigation, QueueMetrics doesn't allow space key string as start or end of names, it just trims empty strings.

static final Splitter Q_SPLITTER = Splitter.on('.').omitEmptyStrings().trimResults();

So, from FairScheduler, "root.adhoc.birvine ", this queue name with the space at the end of name, it is treated as different from "root.adhoc.birvine" because it has one more character, and from QueueMetrics, because names are trimmed, all of sudden, 2 different queue names become the same that causes the error as "Metrics source QueueMetrics,q0=root,q1=adhoc,q2=birvine already exists!"
, Hi [~dongwook], thanks for reporting this issue. I think this issue was fixed at YARN-3241., Thanks, you're right, it's duplicated. I didn't find the other jira case, I will close it., [~dongwook], thanks for the confirmation!]
