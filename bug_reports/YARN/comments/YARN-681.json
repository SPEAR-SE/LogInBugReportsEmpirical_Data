[A couple of refactoring stuff: moving ContainerTokenIdentifier, ContainerTokenSelector, ContainerManagerSecurityInfo from security of common to server.security of server-common, moving TestContainerLaunchRPC from common to server-common, adding and editing the services files in META-INF of common and server-common, and fixing some small code format problems when moving the code., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Patch isn't applying anymore w.r.t TestContainerLaunchRPC.

In any case, ContainerManagerSecurityInfo and ContainerTokenSelector.java can't be moved out of yarn-common. MR and other AMs need it to for security.

Because of that even ContainerTokenIdentifier cannot be moved.

I guess the only change we'll need is MR to not explicitly refer to ContainerTokenIdentifier. Which isn't a big deal. We can close this as invalid.]
