[[~srimanth.gunturi], the url seems to be private, would you pls attach a screenshot or a log?, [~zjshen], the URL is private. If the output is not filtered when filters are provided, then you have reproduced the problem. If the filter params I have used are wrong please let me know. , Checked the latest trunk, RMWebServices provides the filter of both applicationType*s* and state already. Are you looking for more filters or demanding that state can accept multiple values?, Yes, this is already in there, you have to use 'state' and 'applicationTypes' filters.
