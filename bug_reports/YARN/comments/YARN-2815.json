This message is automatically generated., Thank for the patch! An alternative would be to upgrade to ZK 3.5. [~kasha], which would you prefer?, The patch looks good to me. ZK 3.5 is said to be still alpha. It may be a bit aggressive to move to ZK 3.5 now. AFAIK, Hive also depends on ZK 3.4.x.

[~brocknoland] and [~kasha@cloudera.com], any comments?, I would hold off on upgrading to 3.5 at least until the ZK community calls the release GA. 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/issues/?jql=project%20%3D%20ZOOKEEPER%20AND%20affectedVersion%20in%20(3.5.0%2C%203.5.1) shows a bunch of issues with 3.5., Thanks for the comment, Karthik! I'll commit the patch., Committed the patch to trunk and branch-2.
