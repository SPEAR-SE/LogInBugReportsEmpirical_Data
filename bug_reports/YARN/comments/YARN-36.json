[fix missing versions in hadoop-project pom, Hi Radim,
Why does the parent pom need to be updated here? In trunk the hsqldb reference was explicitly removed in HADOOP-8180., its sync against hadoop-2 branch. HADOOP-8180 was for 0.23 branch., Makes sense. +1 confirmed this fixes the 2.1.0-alpha build for me., I've committed this. Thanks Radim!, I believe Eli committed this. ]
