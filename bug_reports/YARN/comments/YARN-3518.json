This message was automatically generated., We need to be careful here. Clients from gateway machines should be treated separately from AMs - a distinction we don't have today. It actually makes sense for clients to retry for a longer time than is usual for AMs., agree, we should set nm, am, client  separately, replace RESOURCEMANAGER_CONNECT_MAX_WAIT_MS with RESOURCETRACKER_RESOURCEMANAGER_CONNECT_MAX_WAIT_MS, APPLICATIONMASTER_RESOURCEMANAGER_CONNECT_MAX_WAIT_MS and APPLICATIONCLIENT_RESOURCEMANAGER_CONNECT_MAX_WAIT_MS, \\
