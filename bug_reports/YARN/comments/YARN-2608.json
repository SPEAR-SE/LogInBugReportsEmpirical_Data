[For the first deadlock, as the clock is only changed by testcases, so we can directly remove the synchronized, and make the clock as volatile. For the second deadlock, we can also remove the synchronized from the reinitialize and initScheduler functions; thus, the reinitialize function would require the * AllocationFileLoaderService's lock* first, and then *FairScheduler's lock*., Nit: Nothing to do with this patch, can we annotate FS#setClock as VisibleForTesting? 

Otherwise, patch looks good to me. , +1, pending Jenkins. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
