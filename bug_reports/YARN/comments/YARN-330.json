[Are you planning to take this on Hitesh?  If not, I can; I wrote the test., @Sandy, sure go ahead., Is this a duplicate of YARN-274?  Thanks!, @Chris, yes - it is a duplicate. I guess you and @Sandy can pick one jira to be kept open depending on who is planning to work on it. 

I noticed that on YARN=274, there was a label marked for fixing this for trunk-win. The script being used to test shutdown is a bash script and relies on trapping the sigterm signal. I am guessing that will be an issue on windows? , Thanks, Hitesh.  Sandy, I won't have immediate availability to work on it, so if you prefer to take it, that would be great.

I first discovered the issue while doing Windows work on branch-trunk-win, but more in the context of making sure that we didn't introduce regressions on non-Windows platforms.  When this gets fixed, I just want to make sure we merge it to branch-trunk-win.  We've been merging trunk to branch-trunk-win frequently, so I expect this will be no problem.

I would consider making the test pass on Windows (not using bash) to be out of scope for this jira.
, I uploaded a patch that should fix the timing.  When I originally wrote it, I stole the SIGTERM part of it from TestContainerLaunch, so when this test is fixed to pass on Windows those should probably be examined too., I tried applying the patch locally, but I still saw the same test failure., Interesting.  You're getting "Did not find sigterm message"?  Do you have the logs from the test?, Yes, I got "Did not find sigterm message".  The stack trace is basically the same, but with different line numbers.  I'm attaching the logs.
, @Chris, could you try the following: 

on line 213 of the test file: 
replace fileWriter.write("while true; do\nsleep 1s;\ndone\n");
with fileWriter.write("while true; do\ndate >> /dev/null;\n done\n");

This message is automatically generated., @Hitesh, I tried the replacement, and that made the test pass for me., @Sandy, what do you think about the suggestion I mentioned earlier? It seems like there is something weird happening with the interaction between sleep and trap on OS X., Thanks for figuring that out!
