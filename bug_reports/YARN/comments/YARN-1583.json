[Line #84 {code}reqAppStates = new HashSet<RMAppState>(appStateStrings.length);{code}
so what do you mean "reqAppStates is of type YarnApplicationState."?, I was looking at this class in trunk.
I don't see the above code snippet.

Which branch are you checking ?, I am checking on **branch-2.2.0**, 
and I just checked on **trunk** a moment ago, the problem you mentioned exists indeed
It's my carelessness, {{if (reqAppStates != null && !reqAppStates.contains(app.getState())) {}}
this code in description is changed now. close this as fixed]
