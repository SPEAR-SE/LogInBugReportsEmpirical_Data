[Thanks for your report, Santosh. IIUC, it's because RM restart Phase 1 only supports re-submitting jobs after failover. Once RM restart Phase 2(YARN-556) is done, states of the jobs are preserved. , As Tsuyoshi said, this is the expected behavior today. The apps are re-submitted after restart/failover. Because we are re-submitting programmatically, the jobs all come in roughly at the same time, and any of them could be scheduled. If you want strictly FIFO behavior, you can always set the policy for that queue to be FIFO. Once work-preserving RM restart is done, we wouldn't kill the running AM and resubmit the app and the order before the restart/failover is preserved. 

Orthogonal - FileSystemRMStateStore is good for RM restart, but can have fencing issues with RM HA. We recommend using ZKRMStateStore for RM HA. 

I propose closing this as a duplicate (is part of) of YARN-556., Closing this issue as a duplicated issue of (is part of) of YARN-556. Please feel free to reopen this issue if you have any comments. Thanks!]
