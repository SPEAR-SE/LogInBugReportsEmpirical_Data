This message was automatically generated., Thanks for the patch [~jeagles]. Can you clarify something - according to https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceManagerRest.html#Cluster_Application_Attempts_API - the logsLink has the scheme. Is the existing documentation wrong?

+1 for the latest patch., Looks like YARN-1553 introduced this error. You can see that it is present both in the RM web services and the RMAppBlock by looking at a specific app page source for the RM:port/cluster/app/app_id. The browser is very accommodating and takes you to the correct address which is why this has been hidden for a long time. If you are ok with this, I would like to check this in., +1 for the latest patch. Will you go ahead and commit it or would you like me to do it?, You can do it if you like. Please ensure it makes it into trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.7., Sounds good. I'll commit it tomorrow morning IST., Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7. Thanks Jonathan!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8402 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8402/])
