[Since the IPC layer is already retrying it doesn't make sense to also retry at the YARN layer.  Attaching a patch that removes socket connection timeouts from the list of errors we retry at the YARN layer.  An alternate approach would be to retry at the YARN layer but explicitly tell the IPC layer to _not_ retry socket timeouts when creating the proxy.  This change seemed simpler and is what we've been doing all along before YARN-2613., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I think this is related to the RetryPolicy library we use from common module.
the implementation of {{RetryPolicies.retryUpToMaximumTimeWithFixedSleep}} doesn't match the semantics. It should retry based on the overall time taken instead of the number of retries.

, The patch applies to 2.6.0 cleanly., What's the setting to tune down to avoid the 45min timeout? I'd like the code to fail fast., Pulled this into 2.6.1. Ran compilation before the push. Patch applied cleanly.]
