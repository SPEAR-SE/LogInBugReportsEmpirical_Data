[This has happened to me too and I would love for it to have a fix!, Got exactly the same issue too. Very painful..., I am getting the same issue., Was discussing this with [~asuresh] offline, and he wanted to take this up. , Hi,
I was trying to find the existing unit-tests for the Fair-Scheduler preeption... All I could find was this:
https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/TestFairSchedulerPreemption.java

Are the more tests hiding somewhere else?, TestFairScheduler has a bunch of tests for preemption as well. It would be nice to move all those tests to TestFairSchedulerPreemption. (hint hint), Sorry for the delay in following up on this. I am looking to take a comprehensive look at preemption in FairScheduler. 

[~damagebo], [~MindTheGap], [~ilanas], [~umiron] - can any of you comment on if FairScheduler is preempting any containers at all? Is it possible that containers are being preempted, but not all on the same node? I wonder if this is just another manifestation of YARN-2154? , [~asuresh], do you have plan to finish this recently? May I move this to 2.9 release if you don't have bandwidth recently?, [~leftnoteasy], please go ahead and move it to 2.9, Thanks [~asuresh]]
