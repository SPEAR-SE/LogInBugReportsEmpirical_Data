[Minimally, YarnCommands.apt.vm.  Likely others., -00:
* Replaced yarn-daemon.sh from timeline docs
* Re-arranged the commands to be in alpha order
* Added missing commands
* Added new options
* Added files section
* Changed default HADOOP_CONF_DIR

I'm leaning towards doing the same thing with the generic shell options that were done with the generic java options: including a pointer to the hadoop common commands manual and just keep the documentation there...., +1, -01:
* Make these documents consistent with and reference HADOOP-10908 appropriately.
* Add quite a few missing commands and options. :(
* Style fixes here and there
* Alphabetize the subcommands
, Committing this to trunk.

Thanks for the review!
