[There appears to be a race condition in the RM's handling of finished applications that may explain this.  ResourceTrackerService is sending the list of finished applications to the node when the node heartbeats and then subsequently sending a status update event to the RMNodeImpl that corresponds to the node.  The RMNodeImpl clears the entire list of finished applications once it has processed the status update.  If an application completes *after* the ResourceTrackerService has asynchronously retrieved the list of finished applications but *before* the status update event is posted to the RMNodeImpl then the application will be added to then cleared from the list of finished applications before the ResourceTrackerService had a chance to notify the node of the completing application., Patch that adds a new interface to RMNode so ResourceTrackingService can atomically get-and-clear the list of containers and applications to cleanup., Increasing to Blocker as this race can lead to lost logs since NM will not aggregate the logs until it thinks the application has completed.  In addition each "leaked" application in the NM has a corresponding log aggregation thread in the NM and eventually it will be unable to create new threads., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Jason, the patch should fix the issue. However, I think it may be cleaner to replace the get APIs with pull/getAndClear APIs instead of using the NM HeartbeatResponse directly. There's similar functionality elsewhere (RMAppAttemptImpl). Also in the unit test - the HeartbeatResponse can be instantiated using Records instead of directly using the PBImpl.
I can update the patch accordingly if you want. (might need an up-merge after YARN-365 iac), Thanks for the review, Sidd.  I originally had it update the heartbeat since the RMNode interface already knew about the heartbeat type and it's more efficient (don't need to create an extra copy of the app list and grab the write lock only once instead of twice).

Updated to change get*ToCleanup to pull*ToCleanup and test no longer needs the heartbeat response since it no longer updates it directly.
