[My guess is that the best way to solve this is to change the NodeManager to send the [fully qualified domain name|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#getCanonicalHostName()] to the ResourceManager when it registers itself., @Roger Hoover, I assume that you were talking about ApplicationMaster of MR, right?

1. Scheduler knows the hostname from RMNode, which is ultimately obtained from ContainerManagerImpl, which parses the hostname of the IPC server.

2. When MR job wants to allocate an container, it send the request, which can contain the hostname information from TaskAttemptImpl#dataLocalHosts. The hostname eventually comes from InputSplit. If it is FileInputFormat, it comes from the input files' getBlockLocations().

Still need to investigate more about how FileSystem name the hosts. If it uses the different method as NM does. It can happen that MRAppMaster sends the request with "aaaa", and Scheduler recognize the same host as "AAAA", leading to mismatch., @[~zjshen], yes, I'm referring to the MapReduce Application Master.  Thanks for looking into this and for sharing what you've found so far.]
