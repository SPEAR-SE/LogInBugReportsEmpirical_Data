    Thank you for the pull request. I reviewed the patch (A) and the another patch in YARN-4434 jira (B) and decided to commit the patch (B) because the patch (B) replaces "i.e. the entire disk" with "i.e. 90% of the disk" as well.

, Hi [~ajisakaa], we are moving on to 2.6.3-RC0. Would you hold on any commit bit (unless they are agreed blockers) to branch-2.6.3 in later commit effort? Thanks., I'm sorry about that. Thank you [~djp]!, Pulled this into 2.7.2 to keep the release up-to-date with 2.6.3. Changing fix-versions to reflect the same.]
