[Applied MAPREDUCE-3867, MAPREDUCE-3869, and MAPREDUCE-4406 with minor changes for the move to the hadoop-yarn directories, Verified that all affected unit tests completed correctly., Comments on the patch:

* Normally CHANGES.txt does not appear in a patch.  This file is modified by the committer when the patch is committed.
* HistoryClientService.java: This change was removed on trunk by MAPREDUCE-4163, and MAPREDUCE-4163 is already in branch-0.23, so it looks like we're inadvertently reverting portions of that change.  Same comment applies to these files:
** AdminService.java
** ApplicationMasterService.java
** ClientRMService.java
** ResourceTrackerService.java

, Jason nice catch! AdminService, ApplicationMasterService, ClientRMService, and ResourceTrackerService did not need any changes when I compared to trunk.   Removed the CHANGES.txt. Retested and all passed.  , The change to HistoryClientService.java is still in the latest patch and appears to be reverting some of the changes introduced by MAPREDUCE-4163., +1, thanks for the update Rob., Thanks, Rob.  I committed this to branch-0.23., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #435 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/435/])
