YARN-3624 only affects the ApplicationTimelineServer. Shouldn't we only change the ApplicationTimelineServer doc ?, \\

This message was automatically generated., [~xgong], thanks for looking.
YARN-3624 only changes the timeline server. But that includes the authentication part as well. Filter initialization is done during the authentication. So I have made the change in HttpAuthentication., [~xgong], let's try to close this JIRA...
Do you think it is still applicable/useful?
I guess it is not needed for the 3.0 version (since we will be using the new version of the Timeline Server), but is it needed for branch-2?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
