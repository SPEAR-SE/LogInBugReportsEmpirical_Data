This message is automatically generated., WSCE should behave the same as DCE. If getFirstApplicationDir() was removed from DCE and getApplicationDir() is used instead, then WSCE should also use getApplicationDir(), w/o a need to define getFirstApplicationDir() in WSCE., Hi [~rusanu],
thanks for the information, I will call getWorkingDir in WSCE. So the WSCE will also randomly pick the local directory., I attached a new patch YARN-2682.001.patch to call getWorkingDir  instead of getFirstApplicationDir in WSCE and remove getFirstApplicationDir function in DCE. This patch doesn't need unit test because the unit test for getWorkingDir is already done in TestDefaultContainerExecutor., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~zxu]! YARN-2198 will probably conflict with this but is only cosmetic. as soon as you commit, I'll resolve the conflicts., Hi [~jianhe], I saw you are reviewing YARN-2198, As [~rusanu] said, we need review and commit this JIRA before YARN-2198 , so remus can resolve the conflict in YARN-2198. Do you have time to review this JIRA?  thanks, looks good , +1, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6276 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6276/])
