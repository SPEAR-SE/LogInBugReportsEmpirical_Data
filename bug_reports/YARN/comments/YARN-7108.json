[bq.sample mapreduce on default queue
Did this MR job submit with any specific label? like AM label or map/reduce label? , Have submitted a mapreduce job with default queue and no label settings.

{code}
hadoop jar hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.7.3.jar wordcount /Input /Output
{code}, So if the app is not submitted to any labeled preference, current behavior is expected, correct?, Thought application will implicitly run on queue's configured default node label. It moves into RUNNING state when the default node label has nodes running, if not it stays at ACCEPTED state which is expected. But refreshing queue's default label to a new label which has nodes running does not refresh the app state. Is this expected behavior.

As per the current behaviour refresh default label of queue doesn't update existing resource request already received.
{{SchedulerUtils#normalizeNodeLabelExpressionInRequest}}.  

, Agree with [~bibinchundatt], pre job ResourceRequest label is setted when submitted(as when as before you modify xml file).
And these requests have been stored in rm, could not be change.
But the new job get the new label is reasonable.]
