[Shall i take this up, [~djp] ?, Hi Naga, please feel free to take it up. Thanks!, Thanks but just one query, 
bq. We should consider to cleanup AHS related configuration and code later
So do we need to work on it now or later, i faintly remember [~zjshen] also raised some jira's related to this but due to compatability issues it was not worked upon ]
