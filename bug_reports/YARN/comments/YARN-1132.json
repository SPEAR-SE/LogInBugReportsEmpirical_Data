[Hi [~ajisakaa], thanks for reporting this.
This will be fixed as part of YARN-1090, thx!, [~jianhe], thanks for comment.
I'll wait for integrating your patch (YARN-1090) into trunk.
, Then, this should be closed as duplicated jira of YARN-1090?, Thanks for your comment, I'll close this issue as duplicated.]
