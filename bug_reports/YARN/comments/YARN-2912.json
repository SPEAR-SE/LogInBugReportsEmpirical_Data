 return UriBuilder.fromUri("http://localhost/")
                .port(getPort(9998)).build();
{code}

The getPort logic uses 9998 as the port unless told otherwise
{code}
int getPort(int defaultPort) {
        String port = System.getProperty("jersey.test.port");
...
{code}

, If we change around the ports by increasing port number in system property by a certain number, before every test case, there is no guarantee that even that port wont be occupied. 
We can probably try to establish a Socket Connection with the port given in system property and if that succeeds, get another port. Probably repeat it a fixed n number of times. But this may slow down the execution of test case., scanning for a clear port isn't that slow, it just adds complexity

One question is : why is this test failing  now? It could be that a previous instance didn't get cleaned up, in which case finding and fixing the leakage may be a strategy. 

Simply using a (rolling) increment may work well most of the time, and ensures that if a port is blocked, only a single test will fail, rather than all of them. Why don't we start with that and then see how well it goes, [~stevel@apache.org], well opening up of a socket on the port is done by Jersey. Port being occupied by another process running on the same machine is also a possibility.
So, I have simply added code for rolling increment of ports for Jersey tests. Increment is by 10 to ensure that if the port is occupied because another application is using it, it will mitigate the risk of next port being occupied if the application uses multiple ports, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Test case failure has nothing to do with code change, Thanks Varun for updating patch. Approach looks good to me that rather all test fail,let only one test case fail.  
Some thought why this can appear randomly,
# As [~stevel@apache.org] said, it could be test case issue also.
# Operating Sysytem itself might have assigned this port to other process randomly.

In the patch, I see every test increment port by 10 which may result in test failure with same reason "address alredy  in use" because of other ports may be in use!!!
So possibility of test failures is more vulnerable all the time rather 1 time failure. Can we set port to 0 , so let OS takes available port. Any thoughts?
., [~rohithsharma], yes I tried setting system property as 0 but that did not work. As socket invocation is done by Jersey API we cant do much other than setting a custom port. The increment of 10 is because if processes open multiple ports they generally do it in a sequence and hence increment by 1 may also lead to port being occupied. Incrementing by 10 will mitigate this risk , let's try it and see
