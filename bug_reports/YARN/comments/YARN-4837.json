[Here are my concerns
 - First up the feature isn't 'AM blacklisting' - we are not blacklisting AMs. The goal is for the system to not schedule AMs on faulty nodes. The right solution is to identify why we keep launching on bad-nodes instead of marking them unhealthy - but I can see why a blacklist threshold is useful when we *simply don't know*.
 - The configurations are all named yarn.am.blacklisting even though they should be under a yarn.resourcemanager hierarchy
 - We just blindly add a node to the app's blacklist even if we just hit *one* AM failure. And the error / exit-code doesn't matter at all.
 - Irrespective of all that, I actually don't see why we should already expose this to end-users i.e the whole premise of YARN-4389. Why should an app specifically care "the number of nodes YARN blacklists for my AM container launch"?

I'm digging into the feature more for a careful look.

/cc
 - [~adhoot], [~jlowe], [~kasha] who were involved with YARN-2005 for the naming changes
 - [~sunilg] / [~djp] who worked on YARN-4389.

While we discuss this, I think we should take the private feature before 2.8.0 goes out., Thanks for calling it out, [~vinodkv]! I also feel uncomfortable on existing AM blacklisting mechanism (agree that name is a bit confusing :(). 
Put some thoughts (and design) on YARN-4576 before. May be we should check how to consolidate these JIRAs?, Adding to discussion about AM blacklisting, there are few corner cases where application can get hanged forever. Especially after blacklisting some nodes, if other nodes removed from the cluster. In such cases, there is no mechanism such that to remove blacklisted nodes for AM. See YARN-4685 for one of the scenario., Thanks [~vinodkv] for pitching in.

YARN-2005 blacklists nodes if AM container launch failed due to DISK_FAILED. And after YARN-4284, blacklisting for am-container-failure is made for all container failure except PREEMPTED. There were few discussion on usecase aspects for this change.

If blacklisting (am container failure) feature is enabled in cluster level, all applications will be forced to comply the blacklisting rule. YARN-4389 had also an option to disable this feature from application end. Also it could control the threshold if its too strict (and vice versa). Yes, agreeing to your point and its early for user  to take blacklisting decisions w/o having much needed/useful information. But by seeing the current aggressive nature, this change was helping in skipping this feature.

Agreeing that this has to be a controllable feature without causing problems in a busy cluster. I think may be a time based purging solution can be ideal to allow same app to use the node again., I just wanted to add my 2 cents to the discussion, specifically about YARN-4284 where we broadened the cause for blacklisting a node for an AM purpose.

AMs repeatedly getting assigned to the same node in spite of failures is one of the most frequent complaints from our users ("why did our AMs keep landing on that bad node, causing our jobs to fail?"). If a node is having a "soft" failure that doesn't quite trip itself over to an unhealthy state, that's the worst possible case. Since the node is still healthy and appears to have a lot of available capacity, the chance that it still gets the next attempt is quite high; i.e. we have node-affinity. And since this is AM, the consequence is much more severe than when a container landed on that node.

Oftentimes, the cause for this soft failure situation is varied, and trying to come up with a precise set of exit codes that meet this criteria isn't straightforward. There are even error codes like INVALID which we see quite often (see [my previous comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4284?focusedCommentId=14966248&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14966248]). I know it could blacklist the node for the app for reasons such as the app's configuration error (false positives). However, the reason we could afford to go broad is this blacklisting is *per-app*. The only downside there is to get assigned to another node.

We have a number of large busy clusters, and we're using this with success and with little downside.

That said, I do recognize that this could be a problem if {{yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts}} is larger than the size of the cluster., [~sunilg] and [~sjlee0],

Appreciate your feedback.
 - Yes, AMs going to 'bad' nodes again and again and failing is a real problem. There are multiple reasons as to why this happens.
    -- It is true we cannot enumerate *all* the reasons.
    -- It is also true that we have some reasons that we *can* already deal with explicitly.
 - The primary reason for this JIRA is that I actually don't believe that users need explicit control *today* on how the AM scheduling on faults (i.e [~sunilg]'s agreement above - "agreeing to your point and its early for user to take blacklisting decisions w/o having much needed/useful information")
 - Like I also mentioned, it is misnamed too. So, let me just call it _AM-container-scheduling_ for the time being.

h4. Modified proposal
So how about we
 - Completely keep _AM-container-scheduling_ inside the ResourceManager and don't expose any user-APIs to skip-nodes
 - Explicitly treat known exit-codes:
|DISKS_FAILED| node is already unhealthy, no need for any skipping nodes|
|PREEMPTED, KILLED_BY_RESOURCEMANAGER, KILLED_AFTER_APP_COMPLETION| Not the app or the system's fault, it's by design, no need for skipping nodes|
|KILLED_EXCEEDED_VMEM, KILLED_EXCEEDED_PMEM| No point in skipping the node as it's not the system's fault|
|KILLED_BY_APPMASTER|Cannot happen for AM container|
|All other non-zero codes|Need some action|
 - And book-keep all other failure cases and do soft-skipping *only* on the server-side. By this I refer to something similar to node->rack locality progression - avoid this node for a few scheduling opportunities and then come back to it after waiting out enough time. This way no node gets locked out, nor does any app get stuck.

If we just do this, we will take care of our most important problem - apps getting affected due to AMs going repeatedly to the same places. And we also (a) won't force our users to already make these decisions without really understanding how and (b) won't introduce the bad problems of 'blacklisting' that exists today - for e.g YARN-4685.

h4. 2.8.0
Even if we don't yet reach the consensus on the above or a similar proposal, I feel strongly that we should remove these user-facing configs / APIs from 2.8.0.

Thoughts?

/cc [~vvasudev], [~jianhe], [~wangda] who may not be looking at this., I am in favor of making these changes if it improves usability by making all this handling transparent. , Yes, [~vinodkv], I agree with the direction you laid out., Hi [~vinodkv], did you see my comments at YARN-4576 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4576?focusedCommentId=15201559&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15201559)?
+1 on "explicitly treat known exit-codes" which is exactly the same as previous proposal in YARN-4576. However, the different is:
"DISKS_FAILED" shouldn't be skipped for the reason I mentioned in YARN-4576. Also, we cannot simply judge system innocent when hitting memory issues.
Also, hide all AM scheduling info/preference from application doesn't make sense in long time: AM can ask for resources for its running containers in the beginning, but application cannot ask how to place its AM even today which is sad to me.
YARN-4685 is something fixable and much better than the age without blacklist (we do see AM keep launching on bad nodes repeatedly and get stuck in many cases). We just need to go ahead to fix YARN-4685., bq. "DISKS_FAILED" shouldn't be skipped for the reason I mentioned in YARN-4576. Also, we cannot simply judge system innocent when hitting memory issues.
As [~vvasudev] pointed out [here on YARN-4576|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4576?focusedCommentId=15202664&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15202664], the right solution is to have the RM detect bouncing nodes and then not to allocate new containers to bouncing nodes until they stabilize.

bq. Also, hide all AM scheduling info/preference from application doesn't make sense in long time: AM can ask for resources for its running containers in the beginning, but application cannot ask how to place its AM even today which is sad to me.
My earlier comment came out a little inaccurate when I said about "hiding AM-container-scheduling inside the RM". What I really meant is that any automatic scheduling decision coming out of system failures/events should be hidden from end-users - just like preemption-handling! We already have ResourceRequest as part of AM-launch-context. No reason why we cannot have more such things. However, this is different from RM automatically ruling out nodes as was done at YARN-2005 and related JIRAs.

bq. YARN-4685 is something fixable and much better than the age without blacklist (we do see AM keep launching on bad nodes repeatedly and get stuck in many cases). We just need to go ahead to fix YARN-4685.
YARN-4685 happened because of an inappropriate solution to a real problem - we should pause going down this route till we figure out the right solution., so, I think we should mark the public APIs to be private/unstable till we get the solution.  thoughts ?, Sounds good to me. We can mark it to be private first., This must go into 2.8.0, marking so.., Here's a (longish) patch that addresses some of my proposal above
 - This still doesn't solve the other bugs like YARN-4685 that can happen with the blacklisting logic. There are a bunch of UI bugs too (callers of BlacklistManager.getBlacklistUpdates() only look at the additions), sigh.
 - Renamed the configuration names, but marked all the new configurations private till we figure the rest of the story with the bugs.
 - Removed the user facing APIs and related classes: AMBlackListingRequest, AMBlackListingRequestPBImpl.java, BlacklistUpdates.java (instead using ResourceBlacklistRequest directly), AMBlackListingRequestInfo.java
 - Removed the references to above from ApplicationSubmissionContext, yarn_protos.proto, ApplicationSubmissionContextPBImpl.java, RMAppImpl.java, ApplicationSubmissionContextInfo.java
 - The above two essentially revert YARN-4389.
 - Changed RMAppAttemptImpl to explicitly encode container exit-statuses in deciding when to blacklist nodes
 - Made a bunch of internal renames to better reflect what they are doing., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~vinodkv] for working on the patch!!.  Overall approach reasonable to me, and going through patch more on depth. 
One suggestion is can default value for threshold reduce to less than 50%? May be reasonable value is 20% or 10% so that probability of occurring issues like YARN-4685 can be reduced. 
{code}
public static final float DEFAULT_AM_SCHEDULING_NODE_BLACKLISTING_DISABLE_THRESHOLD =
0.8f;
{code}, After going through patch, apart from below nit, rest of all looks fine to me.
1. {{In AppSchedulingInfo#updateBlacklistedPlaces}} if-block can be written as  {{changed = blacklist.removeAll(blacklistRemovals)}}
2. I am little bit confused with naming convention for {{blacklist}} with {{placesBlacklist}}. Can it be changed? And is there any plan to support blacklist racks in the future? Just thought from the comment in AppSchedulingInfo from the patch
{code}
 // Set of places (nodes / racks) blacklisted by the system. Today, this only
79	  // has places blacklisted for AM containers.
80	  private final Set<String> placesBlacklistedBySystem = new HashSet<>();
81	  private Set<String> placesBlacklistedByApp = new HashSet<>();
{code}
, Thanks [~vinodkv], patch generally looks good to me, minor comments:

1) Should we disable am-blacklisting by default?
2) Javadocs and method name is not matched:

{code}
  /**
   * RM is updating blacklist for AM containers.
   * @param blacklistAdditions resources to be added to the amBlacklist
   * @param blacklistRemovals resources to be added to the amBlacklist
   */
  public void updatePlacesBlacklistedBySystem(
{code}

One is updating for AM containers and the other one is update by system.

3) Similarily, it's better to add a simple explanation why updatePlacesBlackedBySystem is called when isWaitingForAMContainer == true.
{code}
  public synchronized void updateBlacklist(List<String> blacklistAdditions,
      List<String> blacklistRemovals) {
    if (!isStopped) {
      if (isWaitingForAMContainer()) {
        // The request is for the AM-container, so update the corresponding
        // blacklists
        this.appSchedulingInfo.updatePlacesBlacklistedBySystem(
{code}

4) RMAppAttemptBlock.java:
{code}
      ._("Nodes skipped for AM launches:", rmBlackListedNodes);

{code} 

Update it to be: "Nodes blacklisted by system?

5) Similiarily, AppAttemptInfo.java
nodesSkippedForAMLaunches -> nodesBlacklistedBySystem?

6) ResourceBlacklistRequest -> (Resource)Place(ment)BlacklistRequest?

7) It's better to add a test for shouldCountTowardsNodeBlacklisting changes -- it's important to make sure no regression happens to the behavior., HI [~vinodkv]
One minor nit:
1. {{yarn.resourcemanager.am-scheduling.node-blacklisting-enabled}} and {{yarn.resourcemanager.am-scheduling.node-blacklisting-disable-threshold}} to be added in {{yarn-default.xml}}., Here's an updated patch with fixes and new test.

[~rohithsharma]
bq. One suggestion is can default value for threshold reduce to less than 50%?
bq. 1) Should we disable am-blacklisting by default?
I would like to tackle both of these as part of YARN-4685 so that others also can see.

bq. 2. I am little bit confused with naming convention for blacklist with placesBlacklist. And is there any plan to support blacklist racks in the future?
Yes, that's the idea. In other parts of the code, this list gets passed along to filter both nodes and racks.

[~leftnoteasy]
Regarding renames, I've included the ones you pointed out. There are lot more to be done, but I deliberately avoided them given the current size of the patch.

Addressed other comments.

bq. 6) ResourceBlacklistRequest -> (Resource)Place(ment)BlacklistRequest?
This is public API, cannot rename it now.

Created a new TestNodeBlacklistingOnAMFailures, moved existing tests from TestAMRestart to this new class file. testAMBlacklistPreventsRestartOnSameNodeForMinicluster() is a bogus test, removed it.

[~sunilg]
bq. 1. yarn.resourcemanager.am-scheduling.node-blacklisting-enabled and yarn.resourcemanager.am-scheduling.node-blacklisting-disable-threshold to be added in yarn-default.xml.
Again, I deliberately deleted them for now. I'd like to discuss their re-addition as part of the outcome for YARN-4685., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, latest patch looks good to me. And I will upload patch with [these|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4837?focusedCommentId=15294710&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15294710] changes in YARN-4685, Patch LGTM, +1. Thanks [~vinodkv], Sorry for replying late. Thanks [~vinodkv] for the clarifications. Latest patch looks good to me., [~leftnoteasy] / [~vinodkv] can I go ahead and commit it? I think we may need to rebase to branch-2 and branch-2.8, Looks like need to rebase for trunk too!! Some files are getting conflicts., Updated patch fixing the conflicts.

Can't fix the checkstyle warning - Method length is 174 lines, and the test-failures are unrelated., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for working on this, Vinod. Quickly skimmed through the patch. It is definitely more maintainable, thanks again for the cleanup. 

Just one nit:

RMAppAttemptImpl#shouldCountTowardsNodeBlacklisting: For ContainerExitStatus.DISKS_FAILED, doesn't that mean at least one disk failed? And, the NM can continue running with remaining disks right? Is the idea that even if we schedule it to the same node, the NM wouldn't give the same local directory? If yes, should we clarify the comment accordingly? 
, Updated patch against the latest trunk.

bq. RMAppAttemptImpl#shouldCountTowardsNodeBlacklisting: For ContainerExitStatus.DISKS_FAILED, doesn't that mean at least one disk failed? And, the NM can continue running with remaining disks right? Is the idea that even if we schedule it to the same node, the NM wouldn't give the same local directory? If yes, should we clarify the comment accordingly?
No,  a container is marked with tContainerExitStatus.DISKS_FAILED means that the node is already be marked unhealthy given that most of the disks failed. So, no more containers will be scheduled on that node.

Edited the comment for more clarity to reflect the same., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
