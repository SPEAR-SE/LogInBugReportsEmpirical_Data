bq. These can fail due to access permissions, disc out of space, bad hardware, cosmic rays etc etc. There should be proper error checking to ease troubleshooting.

I agree. The script can fail due to those issues. But for example "disc out of space, bad hardware," belongs to NM issue. We have already handle them at NM side. So, do we really need some pre-check for those issues ? It might not be easy., The problem is that there is no error check in the generated script. For comparison the ContainerLaunch.WindowsShellScriptBuilder will check each line in the generated script by adding this line automatically in the script, after each command:
{code}
@if %errorlevel% neq 0 exit /b %errorlevel%
{code}

I'm not advocating checking for various error conditions before launching the script, I'm saying the generated script itself should have error checking and handling.]
