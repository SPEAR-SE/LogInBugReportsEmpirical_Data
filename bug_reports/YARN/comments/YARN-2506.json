[Zhijie, can you please take this over?

This has become quite entangled since I filed this JIRA.

The good thing is almost everyone loads yarn-common and yarn-client together - so it is only that the organization is bad., Sure, I can take care of it., Moving all tickets targeted for the already closed release 2.6.0 into 2.6.1/2.7.2., Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, [~zjshen], is this something that can be done relatively quickly? That said, wouldn't this be a backward-compatible change, regardless of whether the end state is more desirable?, Any progress on this? FYI, we will cut the first RC for 2.6.2 next week., Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., It isn't worth doing this in maintenance lines, moving this to 2.8., I think this is too old code to move. close, Why not do this in trunk? , Seems like something useful as part of 3.x given that the client library is meant to be part of yarn-client-api, bq. Why not do this in trunk?
Having two diverged code base to maintain is not helpful. This is not a simple move, because of module cycle dependency. 
bq. Seems like something useful as part of 3.x 
sure keep it for 3.x then.]
