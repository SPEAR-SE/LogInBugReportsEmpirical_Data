This message is automatically generated., I encountered the same problem, can anyone make sure that this is the right patch?, I applied this patch, and it really works., Thanks Wuzesheng for verifying the patch., That does look to be the correct patch assuming that the stack trace was against 2.0.2 or before. Either way it is a fix that needs to go in, because I misread the HttpServletRequestJavadocs and missed "or null if the request has no cookies". The fix needs to go into branch-0.23 as well. I am +1 for the fix and will check it in. , Thanks Devaraj for the patch. Sorry it took so long to pull it in.  I put it into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #478 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/478/])
