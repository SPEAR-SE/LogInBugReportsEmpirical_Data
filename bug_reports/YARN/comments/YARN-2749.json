[This is because of race condition and it is the testcase issue. 
This happens when we call AppLogAggregatorImpl.doLogAggregationOutOfBand which will notify and abort the wait to start to aggregate logs. The notify action might be happen be fore the AppLogAggregatorImpl thread starts. The simplest fix could be adding some thread.sleep before we call AppLogAggregatorImpl.doLogAggregationOutOfBand to make sure AppLogAggregatorImpl thread starts., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
