[+1 for first approach,
But [~sjlee0] , [~vrushalic], [~jrottinghuis], any idea why we choose to store it as object ?, I found the way to achieve filtering of an object in infofilter. Infofilters uses an JasonParser to parse the value. So this value can be object in the form of Json. 
For example : To list all the container entities belongs to app-attempt, query can be 
{noformat}
GET /ws/v2/timeline/apps/application_1471931266232_0024/entities/YARN_CONTAINER?fields=INFO&infofilters=SYSTEM_INFO_PARENT_ENTITY eq {"type":"YARN_APPLICATION_ATTEMPT","id":"appattempt_1471931266232_0024_000002"}
{noformat}

Value should be in the form of Json without any space i.e 
{code}{"type":"YARN_APPLICATION_ATTEMPT","id":"appattempt_1471931266232_0024_000002"}{code}

This has to be captured in the AtsV2 documentation along with an example which is missing now for infofilters., Updated the documentation patch  for passing an object in infofilters along with an example., Summary also updated as per the patch provided., Updating documentation should be fine.
Objects should be represented as JSON. This was missed in documentation.
Looks fine to me
