[Patch changes the default appsummary logger to match hadoop.root.logger, which for clients will be INFO, console. This matches the 1.x behaviour.

When starting the RM, the value would need to be set in hadoop-env.sh.

Log4j seems to initialize it's entire configuration up-front irrespective of which logger is actually being used. That's what causes the exception - since users may not have access to the path where the app-summary log is being written., +1. Explanation seems fine to me., Not related to your patch, but shouldn't we uncomment all the RMSUMMARY related configs in log4j.properties. That way simply setting yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.logger is enough to enable it., Updated the patch to uncomment the lines. Don't think that needs a separate jira., +1 for the patch.

One related question. Does "hadoop.mapreduce.jobsummary.logger" need to be set in hadoop-env.sh similarly if we want to enable it? If so, maybe it's good to add a similar comment for it as well., I just committed this.

, Could you clarify the correct statements in hadoop-env.sh which prevent the FileNotFound errors? I can't seem to work it out.

Finally worked out how to do it.

Add this line to hadoop-env.sh:

export HADOOP_APPSUMMARY_LOGGER=INFO,RMSUMMARY

And in log4j.properties change:
yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.logger=${env:HADOOP_APPSUMMARY_LOGGER}

The change in context:

#
# Yarn ResourceManager Application Summary Log
#
# Set the ResourceManager summary log filename
yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.log.file=rm-appsummary.log
# Set the ResourceManager summary log level and appender
yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.logger=${env:HADOOP_APPSUMMARY_LOGGER}
#yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.logger=INFO,RMSUMMARY

# To enable AppSummaryLogging for the RM,
# set yarn.server.resourcemanager.appsummary.logger to
# <LEVEL>,RMSUMMARY in hadoop-env.sh
