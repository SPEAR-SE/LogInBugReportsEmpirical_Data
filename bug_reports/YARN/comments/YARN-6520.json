[thanks for the patch [~cheersyang],
Modifications are fine with me and will wait for the jenkins build to pass then will commit it.
, Mostly jenkins report is not displayed even after manual trigger ! may be HadoopQA was not in the watchers list... added it and resubmitted the patch. , Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for your help! Seems the jenkins job still cannot be triggered, please let me know if I need to submit the patch again. Thank you!, [~cheersyang], have triggered the build again manually, lets check this time !, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hi [~Naganarasimha]

Jenkins is back now, the result looks good to me, the UT failure is not related to this patch. Please let me know if this is all OK now, thanks., [~cheersyang], Find bugs is still showing failures and seems like its reporting the same issues, Any idea why ?, Hi [~Naganarasimha]

The jenkins result contains 2 findbugs reports, 1st is the branch test which gives -1

{noformat}
hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-client in trunk has 2 extant Findbugs warnings.
{noformat}

2nd is the patch test gives +1

{noformat}
hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-client generated 0 new + 0 unchanged - 2 fixed = 0 total (was 2)
