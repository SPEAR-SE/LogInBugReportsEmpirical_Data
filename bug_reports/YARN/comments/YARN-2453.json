This message is automatically generated., [~zxu], thank you for your work on this issue.

I'm a little confused. I don't see this error in either trunk or branch-2. Can you please tell me which version of Hadoop this affects?

Thank you, [~eepayne], [~eepayne] Because the default scheduler used in trunk and branch-2 is CapacityScheduler. You won't see this problem unless you change the scheduler default setting to FaireScheduler or you manually set the scheduler to FaireScheduler., [~zxu]

I see. Thank you for your explanation.

+1 (non-binding) on the fix, As of now, CapacityScheduler is the only scheduler that instantiates PreemptableResourceScheduler. How about, we set the scheduler explicitly in the setup method. The test should just reuse the configuration instead of creating another instance. , Hi [~kasha], Your suggestion is good. I made the change to set CapacityScheduler as the scheduler for this test.
I attached a new patch YARN-2453.001.patch, please review it. thanks, Thanks for the quick update, Zhihai. Should we set the scheduler to CapacityScheduler in the setup method so the entire class can use it?
