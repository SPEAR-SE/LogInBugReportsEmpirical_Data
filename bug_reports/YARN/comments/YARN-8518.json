[[~rkanter], [~szegedim], let me know if you would like me to put up a patch for this.

 , That would be great [~Jim_Brennan], thanks!, I have submitted a patch for trunk.

 , It would also be good to understand why this wasn't caught by the precommit build.  It looks like the nodemanager pom has entries in it intended to run both test-container-executor and cetest as part of the test goal -- is that not working properly?  Could be a separate JIRA, but it would be good to have the precommit flagging these things., The original commit was part of a security fix, so there was no precommit build.  That's one of the downsides of the way we handle security fixes today.
When I ran the test, I must have either already had the {{/tmp/2938rf2983hcqnw8ud}} directory or didn't properly run it., I can confirm that it is running this test for pre-commit builds - I just hit this failure on YARN-8515.

 , Ah, right.  I verified that running mvn test in the nodemanager project does run the cmake-test goals and fails as expected:

So we should be covered on the precommit build in the future.

I'm +1 for the patch, pending Jenkins., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The unit test failure is not related to this change and it looks like there is a Jira for it YARN-5857

I think this is ready for review.

 , [~rkanter], can you please review this fix?

 , LGTM +1

I also ran the test myself to double check., Thanks [~Jim_Brennan] for the patch and [~jlowe] for a review.  Committed to trunk!]
