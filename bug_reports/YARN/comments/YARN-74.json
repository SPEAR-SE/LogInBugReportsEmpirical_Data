[Once this jira is done, in which scenarios do you see NM terminating tasks upon start up also?

For RM restart, I think it might be ok for NM's to terminate running tasks upon shutdown as long as NM gives the RM some time to come back up. If the RM comes back up within that much time, then it can take over control of the tasks as if nothing has happened. If it does not, then I think its best for the NM to terminate the resources utilization it is responsible for, and leave the node in the state it had been upon startup. Thoughts?
, It would terminate containers on startup in cases where NM didn't shut down gracefully or somehow missed something on shutdown - hardware issues, NM crashes, etc.
