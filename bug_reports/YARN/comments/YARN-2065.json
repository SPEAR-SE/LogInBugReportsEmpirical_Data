[Looked at the exception posted in SLIDER-34, the problem is that  AM can get new containers from RM, but cannot launch the containers on NM because of the following method.
The token is generated with the previous container's attempt Id, instead of the current attemptId. And NM is checking the attemptId from NMToken against the attemptId from the container.
{code}
  public NMToken createAndGetNMToken(String applicationSubmitter,
      ApplicationAttemptId appAttemptId, Container container) {
    try {
      this.readLock.lock();
      HashSet<NodeId> nodeSet = this.appAttemptToNodeKeyMap.get(appAttemptId);
      NMToken nmToken = null;
      if (nodeSet != null) {
        if (!nodeSet.contains(container.getNodeId())) {
          LOG.info("Sending NMToken for nodeId : " + container.getNodeId()
              + " for container : " + container.getId());
          Token token =
              createNMToken(**container.getId().getApplicationAttemptId()**,
                container.getNodeId(), applicationSubmitter);
          nmToken = NMToken.newInstance(container.getNodeId(), token);
          nodeSet.add(container.getNodeId());
        }
      }
      return nmToken;
    } finally {
      this.readLock.unlock();
    }
  }
{code}
Changing this method will fix this problem. 

But another problem is that ContainerMangerImpl#authorizeGetAndStopContainerRequest also requires the previous NMToken to talk to the previous container and current NMToken to talk with current container. Luckily, it's now not throwing exception but just log error messages.  we also need to change the NM side to check against the applicationId rather than attemptId. , Changed ContainerManagerImpl#authorizeStartRequest to check against appId instead of attemptId, Also changed authorizeGetAndStopContainerRequest to check against appId.
bq. The token is generated with the previous container's attempt Id, instead of the current attemptId.
This actually should not be a problem after changing the two methods to check against appId instead of attemptId.

I've tested this on the slider minicluster test that kills a container while the AM is down and verifies that hbase comes up to the right #of nodes ...this patch fixes it
