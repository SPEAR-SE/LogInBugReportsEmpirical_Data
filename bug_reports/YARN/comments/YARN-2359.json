This message is automatically generated., +1. Will commit this later today if no one objects. , +1(non-binding), it looks good to me. Also ran tests and confirmed that it works., [~zxu],  thanks for working on it.  I have a question: 
bq. The application attempt is at state RMAppAttemptState.SCHEDULED, it receive RMAppAttemptEventType.CONTAINER_ALLOCATED event, because the IllegalArgumentException(due to DNS error) happened, it stay at state RMAppAttemptState.SCHEDULED. 
where in the code is the IllegalArgumentException thrown ?, [~jianhe] The code is in pullNewlyAllocatedContainersAndNMTokens of SchedulerApplicationAttempt.java
{code}
      try {
        // create container token and NMToken altogether.
        container.setContainerToken(rmContext.getContainerTokenSecretManager()
          .createContainerToken(container.getId(), container.getNodeId(),
            getUser(), container.getResource(), container.getPriority(),
            rmContainer.getCreationTime()));
        NMToken nmToken =
            rmContext.getNMTokenSecretManager().createAndGetNMToken(getUser(),
              getApplicationAttemptId(), container);
        if (nmToken != null) {
          nmTokens.add(nmToken);
        }
      } catch (IllegalArgumentException e) {
        // DNS might be down, skip returning this container.
        LOG.error("Error trying to assign container token and NM token to" +
            " an allocated container " + container.getId(), e);
        continue;
      }
{code}

When IllegalArgumentException exception happened from createContainerToken, the code will skip the container.
Then zero container is returned in amContainerAllocation.
The following code in AMContainerAllocatedTransition in RMAppAttemptImpl.java will keep retry CONTAINER_ALLOCATED in SCHEDULED state.
So IllegalArgumentException will cause zero container returned in amContainerAllocation, which will cause RMAppAttemptImpl stay at state RMAppAttemptState.SCHEDULED.

{code}
     if (amContainerAllocation.getContainers().size() == 0) {
        appAttempt.retryFetchingAMContainer(appAttempt);
        return RMAppAttemptState.SCHEDULED;
      }
{code}, I see, thanks for your explanation. looks good to me too, Checking this in.., Thanks for finding/fixing this issue, [~zxu]. Thanks [~ozawa] and [~jianhe] for the reviews.
