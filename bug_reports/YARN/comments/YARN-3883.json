[It is occurring due to this reason,

While creating ApplicationReport as part of ClientRMService.getApplicationReport(), It is setting YarnApplicationState as FINISHED even when the RMAppState is in FINISHING to the application report. Diagnostics is not available when the RMAppState is FINISHING and it is setting to RMAppImpl during the AppFinishedTransition when it is moving to FINISHED state., [~devaraj.k] I would like to work on this.. If you already started working on this, you can reassign.. thanks, Please go ahead [~brahmareddy].]
