[Hi [~rohithsharma]

IIUC this could be handle by configuring the value 80% of (jute buffer size). 

# Exception log could occupy space (YARN-6125 Bytes limit is added for diagnostics message ) 
# Finish time , priority, queuename can be handle by configuring lesser value

So incombination we should be able handle. 


, I think 80% of  configured jute buffer should be taken implicitly rather than allowing admin to configure 80% of jute buffer. This gives a buffered space for allowing additional information into ApplicationStateData. 

And also diagnosis error message length i.e 64Kb should be private configurations. Otherwise, this issue will be there forever if there is any misconfigured length of diagnosis errors. , {quote}

Since the default value of jute buffer size is currently 1MB , I agree we can make the default value as {{.8MB}}. So does this solve the issues you have mentioned??
I had in mind the cases mentioned in this jira during 5006 missed to explicitly mention in YARN-5006.

Do you find any other scenario which couldn't be handled by configuration??  
So are we good to go ahead with YARN-6819?  If its fine with you , will handle the  default value change also in same jira.., [~bibinchundatt] would you like to provide a patch for this as  per previous comment? , Hi allï¼Œ if we could handle this problem like YARN-5006?
Do the same size check at applicationUpdate,attemptAdd,attemptUpdate operations like YARN-5006 do.
