[I tried to change the folder permission for nmprivate manually by using chmod 700 as its expecting but the issue doesnt see to be resolved., Are you running everything on your install drive(C:)? Windows has special security permissions on the install drive. Try creating another partition and set the local dirs on that partition., Hi Varun,

Thanks for responding. I started running the yarn cmd files by running as administrator and it worked . Also i opened the command prompt and ran it in the administrator mode.

The word count example worked fine for the first time but now im facing a different issue , When i run it now with the earlier setup , job doesnt proceed after this step '15/02/06 15:38:26 INFO mapreduce.Job: Running job: job_1423255041751_0001' and when i check the consolde the status is 'Accepted' and the final status is 'Undefined', Hi,
I have facing the same problem in Hadoop-2.7.2 in Windows. I have found the logs in nodemanager as below and it should be the actual root cause

{panel}
WARN localizer.ResourceLocalizationService: Failed to setup local dir /tmp/hadoop-SYSTEM/nm-local-dir, which was marked as good.

I found another jira task related to this issue
[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3962]

Even though i applied patch, the problem isn't resolved. So i have changed the code manually by commenting the condition check as below,

{code:title=ResourceLocalizationService.java|borderStyle=solid}
private boolean checkLocalDir(String localDir) {

    Map<Path, FsPermission> pathPermissionMap = getLocalDirsPathPermissionsMap(localDir);

    for (Map.Entry<Path, FsPermission> entry : pathPermissionMap.entrySet()) {
      FileStatus status;
      try {
        status = lfs.getFileStatus(entry.getKey());
      } catch (Exception e) {
        String msg =
            "Could not carry out resource dir checks for " + localDir
                + ", which was marked as good";
        LOG.warn(msg, e);
        throw new YarnRuntimeException(msg, e);
      }

//      if (!status.getPermission().equals(entry.getValue())) {
//        String msg =
//            "Permissions incorrectly set for dir " + entry.getKey()
//                + ", should be " + entry.getValue() + ", actual value = "
//                + status.getPermission();
//        LOG.warn(msg);
//        throw new YarnRuntimeException(msg);
//      }
    }
    return true;
  }
{code}

Now it works fine without any issue. It seems we can ignore this condition for virtual account in windows., Hi,
I had setup hadoop 2.8.0 an using the steps mentioned in hadoop2onwindows wiki, was trying to setup the same.
I am facing the same issue.
I do not have the source and cant make changes as done by kumar ranganathan. I just want to get the setup working to learn hadoop.
Was this fixed in 2.8.0? Id there any workaround available other than changing the source?

I tried changing permissions of the dir for domain users and Administrators in windows, but it did not work.

Thanks,
