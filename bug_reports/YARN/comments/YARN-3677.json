Looks like this issue is caused by commit 9a2a95 but there is no issue id in the commit message. Hi [~vinodkv], would you point the jira related to the commit?, [~ajisakaa] thank you for finding the issue.

The commit message says that the contribution is done by [~asuresh]. I think we should revert the change if the JIRA has not been opened yet - we should discuss the point. IMHO, we shouldn't switch the behaviour based on whether HDFS is used or not without the special reason. , Let me fix the trivial issue., Fixing this and one more.., Simple patch.., Talked with Vinod and Arun offline. I understood that it's necessary change. , \\
