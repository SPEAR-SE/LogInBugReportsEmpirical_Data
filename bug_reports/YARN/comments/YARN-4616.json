[[~jianhe] Thanks for reporting the issue. Should we consider RM recover time? Client will retry continuously when RM is in recovery process.   , It make sense to me, I am +1 for changing default value. 
Adding to above improvement, on second thought, why don't we achieve MTTR for RM services less than a minute in several failures for all the client calls? It is just an thought , and need to dig more about this how can it be achieved., my thinking is simply reducing the retry-interval default value to a reasonably small value (like 5-10 s ?) so that clients can re-connects to RM fast, instead of sleeping for such a long interval. ]
