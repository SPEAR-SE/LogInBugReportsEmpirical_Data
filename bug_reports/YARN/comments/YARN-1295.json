[~vinodkv] - look alright to you as well?, [~vinodkv], any concerns?  I'll commit this tomorrow morning if not., I just committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.2.1, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4609 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4609/])
YARN-1295. In UnixLocalWrapperScriptBuilder, using bash -c can cause Text file busy errors. (Sandy Ryza) (sandy: http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1532532)

, [~sandyr], you said you committed to branch-2.2.1, but I don't see the fix here: [branch-2.2.1/.../DefaultContainerExecutor.java|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/common/branches/branch-2.2.1/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/nodemanager/DefaultContainerExecutor.java?view=markup].  I think this would be a good fix for 2.2.1..., Hi Raymie.  The release that was going to be called 2.2.1 is now called 2.3, and the change made it there., Ah yes, the rename.  But is there a case that this is a "blocker bug which is critical from an operational, security or data-integrity perspective" (to quote [this message|http://mail-archives.apache.org/mod_mbox/hadoop-common-dev/201311.mbox/%3CE6104BF3-4925-4D8C-BD1D-CE8B9A042076%40hortonworks.com%3E]) and thus also deserves to be in what is now 2.2.1?  It's a clear regression on an already-fixed-bug, and there seems to be something in 2.2 causing it to be tickled more frequently, which is making it an operational problem (at least that's what we're finding)., My understanding is that 2.2.1 isn't happening at all.  If we do release a 2.2.1, I agree that we should include this in it, though I don't think that this on its own is enough to warrant a release.]
