[bq. 1. NM restarts before it sends containers' information to the new active RM. 
Work-preserving NM restart is supposed to be enabled to persist containers across NM restart 
bq.  NM stops and it could not send containers' information to the new active RM.
If we want to retrieve back these containers, I don't think we can do anything other than persisting the containers, which is what we wanted to avoid., Agreed, I propose we close this as a duplicate., Thanks [~jianhe] and [~vinodkv] for the explanation. Then we'd better enable NM recovery to avoid losing those containers' information., bq. Then we'd better enable NM recovery to avoid losing those containers' information.
That's what work-preserving NM restart does., if the NM machine crashes while RM restart, it seems we'll lost the container info forever, Thanks Jian. Closing it now.]
