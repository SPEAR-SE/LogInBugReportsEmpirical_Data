Will commit it., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10153 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10153/])
YARN-5431. TimelineReader daemon start should allow to pass its own (varunsaxena: rev 8e2614592ddbdb3a1067652bf9dc4a0929d7be16)
* hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/bin/yarn
, Committed to trunk. Thanks Rohith for your contribution, Where's the yarn-env.sh documentation?, Oops, sorry, I did not know about., I have reverted the commit.
[~rohithsharma], kindly make the necessary change., It also needs to get added to yarn.cmd., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10154 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10154/])
Revert "YARN-5431. TimelineReader daemon start should allow to pass its (varunsaxena: rev da6adf5151bb73511f7fb3c95118b91e0aec772a)
* hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/bin/yarn
, Thanks [~aw] for pointing out which are all the files to be modified :-)
Updated the patch fixing review comments. And fixed typo in yarn-env.sh file too., [~rohithsharma], I would prefer to name the opts as {{YARN_TIMELINEREADER_OPTS}} instead of {{HADOOP_TIMELINEREADER_OPTS}} along the lines of YARN_RESOURCEMANAGER_OPTS.

Ideally HADOOP_NODEMANAGER_OPTS should also be named as YARN_NODEMANAGER_OPTS and so on. I see in YARN-1400 only RM opts were changed but not others.
Also should we have better description for these OPTS (for WINDOWS script) along the lines of {{yarn-env.sh}} ?
But these issues are not related to this JIRA and a separate JIRA can be filed for it...

Moreover, timelinereader command is meant only for ATSv2 and timelineserver only for ATSv1/1.5 (i.e. depending on timeline service version you are running)
This isn't very clear from the help. Maybe we can handle this here itself. Do we need to ? cc [~sjlee0]
, I think last point should be fine. Because we capture which daemon to run in ATSv2 documentation., Changing from {{HADOOP_TIMELINEREADER_OPTS}} to {{YARN_TIMELINEREADER_OPTS}} can be done, but other opts are starting with HADOOP.  It would be nice keep as same as other opts. And I am not sure why other  opts are started with HADOOP prefix which is not handled as part of YARN-1400. 

I am open to incorporate in this patch given if it is agreed upon. Otherwise, may be in separate JIRA can be tracked., I am not sure why changes for all the daemons were not made as part of YARN-1400.
But I think OPTS starting with YARN make more sense. I suggested changing it to YARN_TIMELINEREADER_OPTS here itself because this one is new.

Let us see what others think., FWIW, I'm planning on making this all consistent in trunk with HADOOP-13341.  

HDFS stuff will be:

HDFS_namenode_OPTS, HDFS_datanode_OPTS,etc

YARN stuff will be:

YARN_resourcemanager_OPTS, YARN_nodemanager_OPTS, etc

Effectively:

(capital command)_(subcommand)_OPTS

This means one could do HADOOP_distcp_OPTS, MAPRED_streaming_OPTS,...  all in a consistent way without having custom env var handling all over the place., I think since it new opts being added, what varun says make sense to me so that there is no deprecation later for timelinereader. I will update the patch with YARN prefix.  , Updated the patch with YARN prefix., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
