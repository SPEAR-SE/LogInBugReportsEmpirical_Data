[Hi [~joeferner], That is a good find. I can see the change at MAPREDUCE-5965 may trigger this bug. I can take up this issue if you don't mind. thanks for reporting this issue., I uploaded a patch YARN-3768.000.patch which use {{cEnv.split("=", -1)}} to parse the string, so trailing empty strings won't be discarded.
It will also skip bad format environment variable., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for working on this. [~zxu]. Could you also add a testcase which can verify if we give a bad environment, it will not throw out the exception ?

Also, why do we need to keep trailing empty strings ?, Hi [~xgong], thanks for the review. I uploaded a new patch YARN-3768.001.patch, in which I add a test case to verify bad environment variables are skipped.
About keeping trailing empty strings, it will depend on whether an Environment Variable with empty value is a valid use case.
MAPREDUCE-5965 adds option to configure Environment Variable with empty value if stream.jobconf.truncate.limit is 0.
It looks like an Environment Variable with empty value may be a valid use case., \\

This message was automatically generated., Instead of executing two regexes:

first directly via Pattern p = Pattern.compile(Shell.getEnvironmentVariableRegex()) and then via split

can we simply match via a single regex? we can use a capture group to get the value., [~jira.shegalov], thanks for the suggestion! The current code will only look up the pattern {{getEnvironmentVariableRegex}} in value({{parts[1]}}) and replace the matched substring with the stored Env Variable's value. I looked at java Matcher class, I couldn't find a way to do capture group and replacement at the same time with a single regex. Is it possible to use a single regex with capture group to do both split and replacement with different variable? If it is possible, Could you tell me how to do that?, You are right [~zxu], and I actually meant to combine matching k=v pairs and capturing k and v in one shot., 002 attached, with this idea and proper name validation., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~jira.shegalov], thanks for the new patch. I noticed the patch will accept  "a=b=c" instead of discarding it. If the input is "a=b=c", it saves Env variable "a" with value "b". Is it correct? I also noticed the patch will discard Env Variable with empty string value. I am ok with it, but I just want to make sure we don't support Env Variable with empty string value., Thanks for reviewing the patch, [~zxu]! 

bq. If the input is "a=b=c", it saves Env variable "a" with value "b". Is it correct? 
Correct, and I agree it does not look the behavior we want. I think the right behavior is to accept any value between the first {{=}} and the next {{,}}. The value should be {{b=c}} in your example.

bq. I also noticed the patch will discard Env Variable with empty string value. I am ok with it.
I think it might be desirable sometimes to clear a variable that is is set globally.  Let us allow it.

003 patch attached!, \\

This message was automatically generated., thanks for the new patch [~jira.shegalov]! I uploaded a patch YARN-3768.004.patch based on your patch YARN-3768.003.patch to support    Env Variable with empty string value, since you think it might be desirable.
it is a minor change: {{"([^,]+)"}} => {{"([^,]*)"}}. I also updated the test to verify it., Good catch, [~zxu]. I rushed on the way home and forgot to regenerate the patch with the {{*}} change after making it locally.

    Ah geez, I realize now that I may have made a mistake. 
    ```
    "SPARK_YARN_USER_ENV" -> sys.env.filter(kv => kv._1.startsWith("PIO_")).
    map(kv => s"${kv._1}=${kv._2}").mkString(",")).run())
    
    Note the map: kv => s"${kv._1}=${kv._2}"
    ```
    This indicates that it does INDEED create a key=value pair.... so I must have an empty parameter that I am setting, which is a known Yarn bug (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3768). That being said, I could not find an empty parameter in my debug logging. Weird.
    
    I'll close this for now, since it does not seem to be the case that my reported issue is a bug.
