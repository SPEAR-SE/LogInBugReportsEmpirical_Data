[Had investigated this issue, this is caused by YARN-2795. As pointed by [~xgong], the correct behavior is, we should setup HA configurations before login.
Uploaded a fix for it. Have done some tests on a HA+security cluster.

Without the patch, one of RM will always fail to start.
With this patch, both RM can be start and one of them will go to standby state.
Tried to stop/start RMs, the active/standby transition is as expected.
Tried to submit MR job to the cluster, job can successfully completed.

Please kindly review.

Thanks,
Wangda, The patch looks good to me, +1.
