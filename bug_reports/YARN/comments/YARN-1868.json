[Attach a screenshot., Sounds related to YARN-1810., From the screenshots, the IE 11 seems much worse than YARN-1810. The page did show correctly on IE 9, or Chrome on Windows., I just run into the same issue on IE11. Looks like IE defaults to document mode 7 when browsing yarn webui locally. To workaround the problem you can manually change the document mode to Edge. There are a couple of blog posts mentioning a similar problem, e.g. http://stackoverflow.com/questions/20540084/how-to-set-document-mode-to-edge-in-ie11-win8-1, I verified the workaround works for IE 11. I am resolving this as won't fix now since there is a workaround., Reopen this one because the IE configuration is on by default; thus impact the user experience on Windows., Attach a patch demonstrating the fix. I took the fix from the following link:
http://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/ie/en-US/acf1e236-715b-4feb-8132-f88e8b6652c5/how-to-overrde-compatibility-mode-for-intranet-site-when-display-intranet-sites-in-compatibility

If the fix is acceptable, I will add unit tests as well., Seems reasonable. From what I understand, this header is only interpreted by IE. Right?

Can you leave a code comment as to why the header is set and add a test?, [~vinodkv], yes. "IE=8" will only be interpreted by Internet Explorer. I have uploaded a new patch with tests., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
