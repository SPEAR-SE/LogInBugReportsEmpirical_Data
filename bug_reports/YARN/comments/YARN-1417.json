This message is automatically generated., YARN-180 fixed this for CapacityScheduler, seems like FairScheduler is what needs fixing.

I like the overall approach though, this was what I kinda suggested at YARN-180 but it wasn't done that way. +1 for the approach. Tests?, cool...will update the patch with tests.., Patch that sets container token only when the container is pulled by the AM and adds the unit test., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
