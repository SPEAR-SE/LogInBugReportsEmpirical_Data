This message is automatically generated., Instead of handling it in FairScheduler, can we handle this in QueueManager? Essentially, verify the provided queue name is valid before creating it, and throw a very descriptive exception when it is not valid. I think the queue splitting logic also belongs in QueueManager. , Hi [~kasha], thanks for the review, your suggestion sounds reasonable to me. I uploaded a new patch YARN-3241.001.patch  which addressed your comment.
Also I find we need check the queue name in FairScheduler Config File to avoid similar issue, So I add code to check the queue name in Config File and add a test case for it. Please review it., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the update, Zhihai. A couple of minor comments:
# Let us rename QueueNameException to InvalideQueueNameException
# QueueManager#checkQueueNodeName: If we want this method to boolean, I propose we call it isQueueNameValid. Otherwise, we should probably make it void and throw the exception from within this method and not have a separate check at the caller site., Hi [~kasha], many thanks for the review.
