, [~stevel@apache.org], what is your opinion? Thank you!, Thanks for the patch, [~Cyl]. 

While the patch looks good to me, I cursory check of this documentation shows a couple other minor grammatical errors ("but is not sufficient for our purposes since it It does not allow", "also be able register certificates" for example). Would you mind giving the whole document a review in an attempt to catch what we can in one commit?, ok! [~shanekumpf@gmail.com] I will review the whole document and submit a patch later. Thank you for the reply!, Hi, [~shanekumpf@gmail.com], I have submit a new patch. Please check it out, thank you!, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for taking the time to review the entire document, [~Cyl]! One minor comment.

The following still reads a bit strange to me. I think removing "which" would help. Could you take a quick look?

{code}A service instance is running only if the component instances which for the service are running.{code}, Yes, I think you are right! Thanks, [~shanekumpf@gmail.com], and I submit a new patch !, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Sorry for the delayed response. Thank you for addressing that issue. Unfortunately, I did find one additional line that needs changed. However, it would be good to get some additional eyes on this before having you spend time putting together a new patch. [~steve_l], [~templedf] - any chance either of you has a bit to time to review these documentation changes?

Here is the line I noticed. I think we need a "been" in there.
