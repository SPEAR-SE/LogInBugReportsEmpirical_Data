[In OOZIE-1729 Oozie started calling getApplications to look for applications with specific tags.  This significantly increases the utilization of this method on a cluster that makes heavy use of Oozie.

One quick fix for the Oozie use-case may be to swap the filter order.  Rather than doing the expensive checkAccess call first, we can do all the other filtering first and finally verify the user has access before adding the app to the response.  In the Oozie scenario most apps will be filtered by the tag check before we ever get to the checkAccess call., Patch that performs the checkAccess filter last rather than first., \\
