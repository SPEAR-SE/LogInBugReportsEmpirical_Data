[When the nodemanager kills a container it first sends a SIGTERM to the session followed shortly afterwards by a SIGKILL.  It should not matter what the process is doing, since if it ignores the SIGTERM then the subsequent SIGKILL will kill it.  Unlike SIGTERM, SIGKILL is not catchable by the receiving process.  Could you elaborate a bit more on how GC activity is involved?, [~jlowe],GC maybe one kind of reason, by my guess.
My idea is "There is some reason can lead to sub process didnt respones the kill -9 signal from superstratum process."
Because in some node,there is orphan YarnChild process(mr)., Processes escaping from the session is a known problem.  If that's the "leak" being discussed here then this seems like a duplicate of YARN-2904.]
