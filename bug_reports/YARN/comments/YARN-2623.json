[Note that DCE also picks first local dir, DefaultContainerExecutor.java@99:

{code}
    // TODO: Why pick first app dir. The same in LCE why not random?
    Path appStorageDir = getFirstApplicationDir(localDirs, user, appId);
{code}, Thanks for the information. I think the better way to solve the issue is to choose the local directory which has the most free disk space.
I will implement the patch by copying the token file to the local directory which has the most free disk space.]
