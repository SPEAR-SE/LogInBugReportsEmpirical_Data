[While you are at it, can you please fix the following: NMContext.systemCredentials will have concurrency issues - the get and set are not locked., Straight forward patch  to fix the logs to debug level.
bq. NMContext.systemCredentials will have concurrency issues
done, [~jianhe], thanks for taking this JIRA. Shouldn't we use ConcurrentHashMap? IIUC, making the variable volatile for this case is not enough to synchronize. Please correct me if I'm wrong., [~jianhe], oops, I got it. The updating about systemCredentials is done only via setSystemCredentials. Then, your solution is enough. 
One minor nits: TestLogAggregationService#testAddNewTokenSentFromRMForLogAggregation calls   {{this.context.getSystemCredentialsForApps().put(application1, credentials);}}. We should use ConcurrentHashMap for the test case., Or, just put new HashMap via setSystemCrendentialsForApps., [~ozawa], thanks for looking at the patch. The test is sequentially running with a single thread. I think it should be fine., [~jianhe] OK. +1, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
