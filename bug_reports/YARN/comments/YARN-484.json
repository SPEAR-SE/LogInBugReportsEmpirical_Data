Hi Patrick, this is s show-stopper for my deployment of Fair Scheduler. Are you familiar with this issue?

Thank you,
Vitaly, Hi Vitaly,
For problems with CDH it is better to file a JIRA at https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO.  Are you able to reproduce this in Apache Hadoop 2.0.3-alpha?  A bunch of fair scheduler fixes have gone in since CDH4.1.2.

It's interesting that preemption works correctly when not requesting containers beyond the node's capacity.  It makes me think that something must be going wrong with the reserved container mechanism., [~sandyr]
Hi Sandy, I believe I've seen some of your helpful posts on the cloudera hadoop google group. Excuse me if you're a different Sandy. I think that it would be good to have a test in hadoop for this scenario. I filed the issue here because CDH ultimately bundles hadoop components from Apache, so other Apache Hadoop users might be impacted. I will try CDH4.1.2. Should I file a second JIRA in https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO in case CDH4.1.2 exhibits the same issue?

Thank you,
Vitaly, Hi Vitaly,
I am the same Sandy.  I agree that it would be good to have a test for this.  CDH4.2 would be the one to try, as it is the first CDH with a stable MR2 fair scheduler.  Yes, it would be good to file a CDH JIRA and we can move the CDH-related aspects of the discussion there.

Thanks for identifying this!
 , Sorry, I meant to say that I will try CDH4.2.0, which is the latest CDH distribution (not 4.1.2), [~sandyr]:
Confirmed -- the same issue is also present in the latest hadoop CDH4.2.0 distribution., Per Sandy's recommendation, I opened the CDH JIRA https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO-466, I just tried this out on Apache trunk using your configs and preemption worked correctly for me.  I'm going to close this as not an issue and feel free to reopen if you try it out on the Apache distribution and face the same issue.]
