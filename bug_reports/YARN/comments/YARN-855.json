[Agree with you Siddharth.
Just a thought, wouldn't it be more logical to enforce YarnClient to accept YarnConfiguration as a parameter, rather then checking existence of all the parameters in YarnConfiguration, since there is no way to know what user will override in yarn-site.xml
Please feel free to correct me.
Thanks
Abhi, I wish to take it over
Any suggestions/update would like to share  [~sseth] ?
, The simplest would be to check the configuration type - which keeps the API stable.

The reason I mentioned parameters is that apps that use YarnClient may have their own configuration type - e.g. JobConf or a HiveConf. Type information ends up getting lost even if these apps have created their configurations based on a YarnConfiguration.]
