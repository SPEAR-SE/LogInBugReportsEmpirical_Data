[It looks like some of the wiring is in place for this.  We just need to send an ABORT_LOCALIZATION event when the RM tells the NM the app is done., Sorry looking at it more closely it is actually per container ID, so we need to send an event when the container is cleaned up., This turned out to be a much smaller change then I originally thought.  I just added in the cleanup to a handled that was already being called for all containers to delete the container's resources., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
