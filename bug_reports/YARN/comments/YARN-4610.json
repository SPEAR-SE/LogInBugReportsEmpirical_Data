[I believe the issue is in LeafQueue#assignToUser.  That method will modify the amount needed to unreserve for a particular user when they hit the resource limit.  However the amount needed to unreserve never gets reset to zero for the next iteration of the loop, so subsequent apps for different users can end up not receiving containers because it accidentally thinks it needs to unreserve based on that stale value., Patch that resets the amount needed to unreserve at the beginning of canAssignToUser.  That way subsequent users in the loop will not accidentally inherit a previous user's amount.

A potential workaround until this appears in a release is to set yarn.scheduler.capacity.reservations-continue-look-all-nodes to false in capacity-scheduler.xml.  Note that this property is refreshable via yarn rmadmin -refreshQueues, so changing it does not require a restart.  After this fix the property should be restored to true to avoid the original issue fixed in YARN-3434., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~jlowe], it's a nice finding!

+1 to the fix, but could you take a look at failed tests? Not sure if they're related to this fix., +1.  Thanks for fixing this. , bq. could you take a look at failed tests? Not sure if they're related to this fix.

The TestApplicationPriority failure appears to be unrelated.  I tried multiple times to reproduce it with the patch applied, and it always passes.

The TestClientRMTokens failure is unrelated.  It's failing the same way for other precommit builds, and is being tracked by YARN-4306 / HADOOP-12687.

The TestAMAuthorization failure is unrelated.  It's failing the same way for other precommit builds, and is being tracked by YARN-4318 / HADOOP-12687.

The TestClientRMService failure is unrelated.  It's failing the same way in some other precommit builds (e.g.: see https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/10285/artifact/patchprocess/patch-unit-hadoop-yarn-project_hadoop-yarn_hadoop-yarn-server_hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager-jdk1.8.0_66.txt).  I tried running it multiple times with the patch applied, and it always passed.  I couldn't find a tracking ticket for this one, so I filed YARN-4613.

I'm guessing the TestAbstractYarnScheduler is unrelated.  Note that it didn't fail with JDK7 but does with JDK8.  I tried isolating the test with JDK8, and it doesn't fail, yet it fails when run as part of the suite.  I'll investigate it further to see if I can narrow down why it's failing in JDK8, but the fact that it's passing on another JDK and also passes when run in isolation indicates it's likely not a problem with the patch., Forgot to mention that TestApplicationPriority is failing in the same way for other precommit builds (e.g.: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/10177/artifact/patchprocess/patch-unit-hadoop-yarn-project_hadoop-yarn_hadoop-yarn-server_hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager-jdk1.8.0_66.txt), and only failed on one JDK version vs. another.  Couldn't find a tracking ticket for that one, so I filed YARN-4614., TestAbstractYarnScheduler is failing the same way occasionally on trunk without the patch applied.  Filed YARN-4615., Ok thanks for investigating.  +1 from me feel free to commit., Thanks for the reviews!  Committing this., Actually it doesn't apply to branch-2.7, so working on a patch for that as well., Patch for branch-2.7.  Clearing of the amount needed to unreserve had to be in a different place for 2.7 since there were multiple places that could set that value (i.e.: canAssignToThisQueue also sets it).

, Sorry after looking some more I think there might be an issue with this for parent queue max capacities, looking some more., Nice catch, Tom!  I think we need to preserve the original amount needed to unreserve and reset back to that before evaluating each application.  That way we'll honor the amount needed that can be passed in from the parent.  Updated the branch-2.7 patch accordingly.

It's always zero from the parent in trunk so no need to preserve it, but I can update the trunk patch to match if desired., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Whitespace complaints are bogus, and test failures are unrelated.  The TestClientRMTokens and TestAMAuthorization failures are the same as in trunk.  TestSystemMetricsPublisher is failing on branch-2.7 without the patch, filed YARN-4623., +1 for branch 2.7.  After investigating this some more the original patch of setting it to none() works. The reason is that the parents limit is passed and it would be taken into account int he leaf calculation.  I think the latter patch is safer but either is fine with me.

The master patch I'm not sure about how its taking the max capacity into account so I'll have to look at that more, but the unit tests are passing and that would be a separate issue from this fix.  +1 on that patch as well., Thanks for the reviews!  Committing this.
