[I think we should set the defaults to

{code}
<property>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services</name>
    <value>mapreduce_shuffle</value>
    <description>Auxilliary services of NodeManager</description>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.mapreduce_shuffle.class</name>
    <value>org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ShuffleHandler</value>
  </property>
{code}

so nodemanagers will start out of the box., This looks like a duplicate of YARN-1289, [~arpitgupta] Can you confirm whether your yarn-site.xml has no aux-services configured or the mapreduce shuffle service was mis-configured using "mapreduce.shuffle" instead of "mapreduce_shuffle"? This clarification will help get to the underlying issue.

Confirmed when yarn.nodemanager.aux-services and yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.mapreduce_shuffle.class are not defined the nodemanager comes up and registers with the RM.]
