, [~wilfreds], IIUC, the issue here is that the exit code returned from delete as user is not successful and hence indicates failure.
But we would still continue to delete other directories in the list. Correct ?, correct, if you pass in multiple directories then a directory in that list which does not exist on the file system should not be fatal. We should not stop processing and just continue with the next in the list. In that way a directory that does not exist is not a failed delete. The end result is the correct the directory does not exist (any more) on the FS and should thus not be a failure.

I am not sure what is going on with the build but it looks like {{protoc}} failed which caused a cascading failure.

, It seems protoc is not setup on the host(s) on which the build ran. Let me try if invoking the build manually would make it pick up a host where the error does not appear., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
