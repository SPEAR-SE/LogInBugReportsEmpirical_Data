[Attached the Snapshot , IE 11 refused to work with rgba color format. 
There are two solution for the same.
1.  To correct the same we can add the below meta in the html.
{CODE} <meta http-equiv="x-ua-compatible" content="IE=edge" /> {CODE}
But this fix will induce the backword compatibitly issue, means in lower version of IE8, IE9 etc will not work.

2. Along with with the rgba value we can use the hex value as well. OR we can use only hex
 For example;
{CODE} background:rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.8);background:#ff8c00" {CODE}, \\

This message was automatically generated., [~mohdshahidkhan] Can you check checkstyle issues?, Patch having the checkstyle fix, Thanks [~mohdshahidkhan] for updating the patch.
nit : Can you change the color combination with below hex values, just to make the change from rgba to hex color transparency remains same.
background:rgba(255, 140, 0, 0.8)  -->  background:#FFA333
background:rgba(50, 205, 50, 0.8)  -->  background:#5BD75B
background:rgba(0,0,0,0.25)        -->     background:#BfBfBf 
background:rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.8) --> background:#fefefe
