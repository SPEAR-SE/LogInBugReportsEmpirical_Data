[In case of State=FAILED, FinalState=FAILED, the override is something like:

{{Application application_1352326804484_0004 failed 1 times due to AM Container for appattempt_1352326804484_0004_000001 exited with exitCode: 1 due to: .Failing this attempt.. Failing the application.}} 

That is with non zero AM exit code, no trace of the original message.

For FINISHED/SUCCEEDED and FINISHED/FAILED it is blank.

Under either scenario info set by the AM should not be lost.
