This message is automatically generated., Nice catch. I have a minor comment: {{updateThread.start()}} should probably be in a try-catch, and catch should set {{initialized}} to false. Otherwise, +1, I noticed this independently and fixed it in my patch for YARN-184. If this one is used, starting the UpdateThread should happen after creating the QueueManager, and there's no need to check the initialized variable in the Update thread because it will always be true., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
