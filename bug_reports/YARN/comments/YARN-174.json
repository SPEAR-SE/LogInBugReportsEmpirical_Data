[Aaah, I was running into this when testing for YARN-170 and thought it was a problem with my code., Sandy, we shouldn't have any methods to override configuration, init() method exists solely for this reason. So createRebootConfiguration() isn't the correct way.

The problem is that we are creating a new configuration on reboot, instead of using the configuration that user passed in during init. We should fix that., Sandy, trunk builds are all failing because of this. I am taking this over from you, hope you don't mind.

This message is automatically generated., Sorry, missed your comment on Friday.  Thanks for taking it on!, The change is small and does fix the test so I am +1 on the change.  Feel free to check it in Vinod.  I would like to see the System.exit replaced by a ExitUtil.terminate, but that can wait for another JIRA., Thanks for the review Bobby. I just committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-0.23., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #2909 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/2909/])
