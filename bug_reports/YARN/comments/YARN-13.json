[Simple patch to update the pom. With this fix, I can build branch-2 again., I don't seem to have permissions to Submit Patch, and not sure if the precommit builds are running on the YARN project yet. So if someone can review this as-is that would be great to unblock build ability :), new rev also fixes the parent pom versions (oops), +1]
