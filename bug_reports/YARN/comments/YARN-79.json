This message is automatically generated., Looks ok +1. Surprising that the AMRMProtocol.close() did not implement Closeable. I guess all users explicitly called close()., bq. Surprising that the AMRMProtocol.close() did not implement Closeable. I guess all users explicitly called close().
The close() code-path gets triggered only if clients (here AMs) explicity shutdown the RPC client, seems like we aren't doing that in MR AM for e.g.

Pushing this in., Thanks for the review Bikas.
