[I do agree that StandBy RM should expose jmx and metrics. I did some analysis by comparing /jmx for active rm's and standby rm's(with private patch). All the metrics that were listed in /jmx are consistent with Active details and standby details. But I could not find any details when "/metrics" page when I tried from browser's(IE,chrome and fairefox).It displayed empty page!!! . I think /metrics details are embedded in /jmx only.


, Moving all tickets targeted for the already closed release 2.6.0 into 2.6.1/2.7.2., Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., Hi, can we move this out of 2.6.3? Thanks!, Moving it to 2.6.4 as no update for a while., Apologies for missing the sequence of comments:-( I will try to make a progress on this., Gearing up on this issue, I assume that just avoiding  cluster metrics and jmx from redirecting to active would be sufficient. But one thing I noticed that in YARN-1898, JMX and metrics were removed from NON_REDIRECTED_URIS  in addendum patch. Is this JIRA intention is to revert that or need to add more JMX metrics like for supporting HA like YARN-2442?
[~kasha] would  you provide your thoughts please?, Move it to 2.6.5 as 2.6.4 is almost get kickoff for vote., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., [~xgong] would you review patch please?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Moving this issue to 2.6.6. Please move back if you feel otherwise., Hi [~kasha] & [~rohithsharma], 
Seems like we have not completely established what JMX and metrics which we are planning to expose from the standby RM so it would be ideal to come up with it before starting to expose the JMX and metrics from standby. Hence cancelling the patch.]
