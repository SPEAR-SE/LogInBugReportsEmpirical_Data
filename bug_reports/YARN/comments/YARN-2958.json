This message is automatically generated., Test failure unrelated. Passing in local. Findbugs to be addressed by YARN-2938, [~varun_saxena], thanks for working on this!

I think we can remove the latestSequenceNumber arg for {{RMStateStore#updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber}} and {{RMStateStore#updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumberInternal}} and also fix all underling stores to not update seq number.  And fix the method name to be updateRMDelegationToken only. , Thanks [~jianhe] for the review. I think latestSequenceNumber is not required even in storeRMDT operation. Will change and upload a new patch., Thanks [~varun_saxena], 
bq.  latestSequenceNumber is not required even in storeRMDT operation
I think it is required, as we want to persist the seq number separately. , [~jianhe], I mean we can take it from RMDelegationTokenIdentifier#getSequenceNumber and remove latestSequenceNumber parameter from  RMStateStore#storeRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber. We can persist the sequence number by taking it from RMDelegationTokenIdentifier, [~jianhe], I mean we can take it from RMDelegationTokenIdentifier#getSequenceNumber and remove latestSequenceNumber parameter from  RMStateStore#storeRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber.

This message is automatically generated., [~jianhe] / [~zjshen], kindly review, Will review the patch, 1. No need to add {{isUpdateSeqNo}}. Updating a non-existing znode is storing a DT, we should update the seq number of it. So we just need to use {{isUpdate}}
{code}
-      int latestSequenceNumber, boolean isUpdate) throws Exception {
+      boolean isUpdate, boolean isUpdateSeqNo) throws Exception {
{code}

2. store|updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber is better to be renamed to store|updateRMDelegationToken. We have removed the sequence number from the param list, therefore taking the method as the black box, we don't need to what else is stored separately.

3. Instead of changing {{sequenceNumber}} to 0, can we set 1111 to dtId1 and verify it later?
{code}
-    int sequenceNumber = 1111;
-    store.storeRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber(dtId1, renewDate1,
-      sequenceNumber);
+    int sequenceNumber = 0;
+    store.storeRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber(dtId1, renewDate1);
{code}, [~zjshen], thanks for the review. Please find my replies below.

bq. No need to add isUpdateSeqNo. Updating a non-existing znode is storing a DT, we should update the seq number of it. So we just need to use isUpdate
The reason I added this new flag is because when we update the Delegation token, we first check whether znode exists or not. And if it doesnt exist we store it as a new token(not update it). In this case, I think we should not overwrite the sequence number. Now I am not sure if non existence of znode while updating DT is a valid use case(could not think of any) or just defensive programming but anyhow we store DT if znode to be updated is not found.. Refer to code below.
{code:title=ZKRMStateStore.java}
  protected synchronized void updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumberInternal(
      RMDelegationTokenIdentifier rmDTIdentifier, Long renewDate,
      int latestSequenceNumber) throws Exception {
    ...........
    if (existsWithRetries(nodeRemovePath, true) == null) {
      // in case znode doesn't exist
      addStoreOrUpdateOps(
          opList, rmDTIdentifier, renewDate, false, false);
      LOG.debug("Attempted to update a non-existing znode " + nodeRemovePath);
    } else {
      // in case znode exists
      addStoreOrUpdateOps(
          opList, rmDTIdentifier, renewDate, true, false);
    }
    ......
  }
{code}

bq. store|updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber is better to be renamed to store|updateRMDelegationToken
Ok. Will change.

bq.  Instead of changing sequenceNumber to 0, can we set 1111 to dtId1 and verify it later?
Will do so., bq. And if it doesnt exist we store it as a new token(not update it). In this case, I think we should not overwrite the sequence number.

If you take a look at the old addStoreOrUpdateOps. Storing DT and writing last sequence number is put in the same opList, hence both are executed or neither. If znode doesn't exist when updating, we suspet DT is not written, and neither does the sequence number., bq. If you take a look at the old addStoreOrUpdateOps. Storing DT and writing last sequence number is put in the same opList, hence both are executed or neither.
[~zjshen], I had actually made it conditional in the patch i.e. sequence number will be put in the opList only if isUpdateSeqNo is enabled.
Anyways, if we go by the assumption that "If znode doesn't exist when updating, we suspet DT is not written, and neither does the sequence number", we do not need isUpdateSeqNo flag. I will make the change and upload a new patch.
Thanks for the review., The last patch looks good to me. [~jianhe], do you have any further comments? Otherwise, I'll commit the patch late today.

In AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager, the following code should be no longer useful in YARN scope. However, in case other impl of AbstractDelegationTokenSecretManager, doesn't store last sequence number separately, let's still keep this logic.
{code}
    if (identifier.getSequenceNumber() > getDelegationTokenSeqNum()) {
      setDelegationTokenSeqNum(identifier.getSequenceNumber());
    }
