This message is automatically generated., I did some investigation on the test failure. It seems not to be the problem the test case, but the issue of DelegationTokenManager, which allows user to set external tokenManager, but make the assumption that all the token is o.a.h.security.token.delegation.DelegationTokenIdentifier. RM send RMDelegationTokenIdentifier and serialize the token in one way, and now DelegationTokenManager receives the token, and deserialize it in another way, resulting the bug. Will file ticket for this issue., [~vvasudev], thanks for the patch. It looks good to me overall. Based on this patch I made code polishing as well as the following changes:

1. Keep the filter name being RMAuthenticationFilter as we don't change the class name.

2. Change proxyuser prefix to "yarn.resourcemanager". The other DelegationTokenAuthenticationFilter use cases take the specific prefix as well instead of the common one "hadoop". The benefit should be different use cases can have their individual proxyuser setting.

Upload a new patch accordingly.

One more thing: RMAuthenticationHandler seems to be useless, we may want to discard it. Let's do it separately?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

{quote}

I don't think we need to introduce a new variable to configure proxyusers. I think it's reasonable for now to assume that proxyusers are setup for RPC and REST. I think we should use "hadoop.proxyusers" instead of introducing "yarn.resourcemanager.proxyusers".

Apart from that the patch looks good to me. Thanks again for all the help!, {quote}

{quote}

Forgot to address this - lets do it as part of a separate ticket., bq. I think we should use "hadoop.proxyusers" instead of introducing "yarn.resourcemanager.proxyusers".

KMS and HTTPFS are using this feature as well, but using their individual prefix before "proxyusers". I think it makes sense because each component can edit its own proxyusers. In particular, it's desired in single-node cluster. Thinking about the property name again, should we use "yarn.resourcemanager.webapp" to be consistent with the existing YARN config names?, Thanks for pointing out the KMS and HTTPFS examples. I think the "yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.proxyuser" prefix probably makes most sense., Update the config name, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., overall Looks good. One comment:
{code}
+  public void doFilter(ServletRequest request, ServletResponse response,
+      FilterChain filterChain) throws IOException, ServletException {
+    HttpServletRequest req = (HttpServletRequest) request;
+    // For backward compatibility, allow use of the old header field
+    final String oldHeader = req.getHeader(OLD_HEADER);
+    if (oldHeader != null && !oldHeader.isEmpty()) {
+      String newHeader =
+          req.getHeader(DelegationTokenAuthenticator.DELEGATION_TOKEN_HEADER);
+      if (newHeader == null || newHeader.isEmpty()) {
+        HttpServletRequestWrapper wrapper = new HttpServletRequestWrapper(req) {
+          @Override
+          public String getHeader(String name) {
+            if (name
+              .equals(DelegationTokenAuthenticator.DELEGATION_TOKEN_HEADER)) {
+              return oldHeader;
+            }
+            return super.getHeader(name);
+          }
+        };
+        super.doFilter(wrapper, response, filterChain);
       }
+    } else {
+      super.doFilter(request, response, filterChain);
     }
{code}

Here, we handled case:
1)when oldHeader is null/empty
2)When oldHeader is not null/empty and newHeader is null/empty.
Do we need to handle the case when oldHeader is not null/empty and newHeader is not null/empty here as well ?
So, maybe we could check newHeader first. As I understand, if newHeader is not null/empty, it will be used no matter whether oldHeader is set or not. , If both headers are specified, we should use the new one. That code is only there for backwards compatibility. If the new header is specified, there's no need for us to do anything., No even need to call super.doFilter() ???, bq. No even need to call super.doFilter() ???

I completely missed that. Great catch! [~zjshen], we need to handle the case Xuan pointed out., Good catch! Fix the issue in the newest patch., +1 LGTM, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
