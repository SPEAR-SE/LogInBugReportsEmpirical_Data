[[~jianhe] I am looking into problem,is it from trunk version? I could not see line number matching!!
The scenario I think is refreshQueue has been triggered concurrently by removing childqueues. Is this is the case in your scenario?, The synchronization of childQueues looks not enough. Attaching a first patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

In ParentQueue#completedContainer, the following is not synchronized, I think this should be inside the previous queue synchronization block. 
{code}
      if (sortQueues) {
        // reinsert the updated queue
        for (Iterator<CSQueue> iter=childQueues.iterator(); iter.hasNext();) {
          CSQueue csqueue = iter.next();
          if(csqueue.equals(completedChildQueue))
          {
            iter.remove();
            LOG.info("Re-sorting completed queue: " + csqueue.getQueuePath() + 
                " stats: " + csqueue);
            childQueues.add(csqueue);
            break;
          }
        }
      }
