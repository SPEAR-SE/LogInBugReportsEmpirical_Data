[This breaks SLS for a while. Hi [~rohithsharma], are you working on this?, I believe this is due to the change introduced in YARN-7190

We would need to include the timeline service jars in classpath.

Is it possible for you to include "${HADOOP_YARN_HOME}/${YARN_DIR}/timelineservice"'/*' in your classpath? 

Similar issue fixed in HADOOP-15166
, Thanks [~vrushalic]. It works. Posted the patch v1. [~rohithsharma], can I take this?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

Sure, assigned to you., Thanks [~rohithsharma]. Could you help to review the patch?, +1 on the patch. One question I have though, is that, does SLS uses ATSv2 for any purpose? If so, we'll need to check ATSv2 setup as well. It's fine otherwise., Thanks [~haibochen] for the review. No. SLS doesn't use any ATSv2 related features as I know., Sounds good. I'll check it in shortly., Thanks [~sunilg] for reporting, and Yufei for the patch., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13881 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13881/])
YARN-7794. SLSRunner is not loading timeline service jars, causing (haibochen: rev fcea5a4d798a517443afd0b441883ccc4e9136ba)
* (edit) hadoop-tools/hadoop-sls/src/main/bin/slsrun.sh
, Doing 3.1.0 RC1 now, moved all 3.1.1 (branch-3.1) fixes to 3.1.0 (branch-3.1.0), Remove "3.2.0" from fix versions if 3.1.0 exists., Ran into this issue on branch-2. Seems this applies to branch-3.0, can we commit this there too? 

 

Also attached YARN-7794-branch-2.001 patch for branch-2 and branch-2.9, [~haibochen]/[~yufeigu] could you take a look? Thanks!]
