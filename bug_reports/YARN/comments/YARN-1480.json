This message is automatically generated., Hi [~kj-ki], thanks for the patch. Here're some meta comments on it:

1. I looked into the current RMWebServices#getApps(), and below is the list of missing options in ApplicationCLI. "queue" (current "queue" option is for the "movetoqueue" command) and "tags" are not covered in the patch. If it's not a big addition, is it better to include these two options into the option list?
{code}
      @QueryParam("finalStatus") String finalStatusQuery,
      @QueryParam("user") String userQuery,
      @QueryParam("queue") String queueQuery,
      @QueryParam("limit") String count,
      @QueryParam("startedTimeBegin") String startedBegin,
      @QueryParam("startedTimeEnd") String startedEnd,
      @QueryParam("finishedTimeBegin") String finishBegin,
      @QueryParam("finishedTimeEnd") String finishEnd,
      @QueryParam("applicationTags") Set<String> applicationTags
{code}

2. ApplicationClientProtocol#getApplications already support full filters, while YarnClient seems not to support the full options now. IMHO, the right way here  is to make YarnClient to support full filters, and ApplicationCLI simply calls the API. It is an inefficient way to pull a long app list from RM and do local filtering., Thank you for reviewing, [~zjshen]. Attached an updated patch.
- Added "tags" option as "appTags".
- The "queue" option is also available as an application filter in this patch.
- Removed local filter and changed to use ApplicationClientProtocol#getApplications via YarnClient. Only "finalStatus" filter is leaved because of unsupported operation., Moving all tickets targeted for the already closed release 2.6.0 into 2.6.1/2.7.2., Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, [~kj-ki], [~zjshen], any update on this JIRA?, Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., Hi, can we move this out of 2.6.3? Thanks!, Move it to 2.6.4 as no update on JIRA for a while., Move it out of 2.6.4 given no update in this JIRA for a long time., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release.]
