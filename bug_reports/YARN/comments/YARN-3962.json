[When node manager runs as virtual account, the
 resourcelocalization service fails to come. It checks for the permission of
 usercache and file cache to be 755 and nmPrivate to be 700. But in windows,
 for virtual account, the owner and group is same. So this pemrission check
 fails. So added a check that is user is equal to group, then umask validation
 dont hold, When node manager runs as virtual account, the

This message was automatically generated., The patch looks fine. Is it possible to add some testcases to verify this ?
[~cnauroth] Could you review this, too ?, This looks good to me.  I agree with Xuan that it would be good to find a way to add unit tests.  Thank you, Madhumita!, Canceling patch because it needs a unit test., We've been using this internally for a while and when testing 2.9 we hit the same issue.
I'd like to try this out again., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
