This message was automatically generated., Nice catch [~nijel]. Thanks for working on this.

Can you add a test to cover this change? Thanks.
, Thanks [~devaraj.k] for the review
Test case looks bit tricky :)
i will update the patch soon., You can possibly extract the code contained in the run() as a test scope method in the AbstractYarnScheduler class and then you can add test for the new method., Thanks [~devaraj.k] for the suggestion
Updated patch with test case
Please review, Submitting Patch to run the Jenkins., \\
