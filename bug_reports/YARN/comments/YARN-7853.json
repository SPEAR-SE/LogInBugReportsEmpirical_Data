[TimelineCollectorManager is in package hadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar. We probably want to put hadoop-yarn-server-timelineservice-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT.jar into /hadoop-tools/hadoop-tools-dist/target/hadoop-tools-dist-3.1.0-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/tools/lib  so that it could be in the classpath of SLS. , It is dup of YARN-7794., Thanks [~rohithsharma]. Close it as duplication]
