[I took a look at the state transitions and I think I know what's going on.

Running containers gets incremented in LaunchTransition and decremented in ContainerDoneTransition, if the state it's transitioning from is EXITED_WITH_FAILURE or EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS.  

If a container goes directly from LOCALIZING to EXITED_WITH_FAILURE, it will never go through the LaunchTransition, so the running containers will never be incremented.  But it will still be decremented., Attaching a patch to fix the issue.  Verified that the test I added fails without the change., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
