[[~naren.koneru], would you still like to work on this ? cc/ [~kasha] , Hi Jian, I won't be able to.. Feel free to take it.., I'm just reading through FairScheduler.md and found the following on line 197 :

{quote}
Anybody who may administer a queue may also submit applications to it.
{quote}

Does it need to be made clearer, or is everybody happy that covers it?
, This looks to be resolved. [~d4rr3ll]'s comment is the line that exists. If there needs to be any additional clarity, I can add so accordingly.

Thank you.]
