[Today node manager doesn't do this filtering of tokens. 

Proposal :-
Let node manager filter out AMRMToken from tokens while launching container other than AM. Thereby we are only (truly) allowing AM container to talk to RM on AMRM protocol.

Enhancements :- today node manager doesn't know which container is AM container. There are lot of problems because of this. So we first need a way to inform node manager about the container being AM. As today node manager comes to know everything about the new container from container token so it will be better to add isAM flag inside the token . Thoughts? 
(Note: we are anyway not encouraging users to talk to RM using multiple containers which are sharing same AMRMToken).
