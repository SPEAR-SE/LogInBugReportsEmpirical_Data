This message is automatically generated., The release audit error is from a hdfs file and unrelated., looks good, one minor comment in the test case:
- the following assertion depends on timing, as the allocation happens asynchronously, it might fail. could you use a loop to check if the container is allocated, otherwise timeout.
{code}
    Thread.sleep(1000);
    allocResponse = am1.schedule();
    Assert.assertEquals(1, allocResponse.getAllocatedContainers().size());
