[We need those conf files for YARN tests themselves. I can see why downstream projects can break. I think the real problem is that MiniYARNCluster is under a test jar (under src/tests). I think that moving class to regular code (src/java) will avoid this.

IOW, downstream projects will need to start depending on hadoop-yarn-server-tests-2.3.0.jar instead of hadoop-yarn-server-tests-2.3.0-tests.jar if we change that. At which point whether we have core-site in our test code or not shouldn't matter.

This is kind of an incompatible change w.r.t jar dependencies. I'd like to gather opinions before we do this.
, Thanks for having a look Vinod, yes I agree it would be better to pull in the mini cluster to src/java. Another thing we could do is to simply have an exclude clause, something like:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5554, Excluding core-site.xml while building test.jar seems to work, and should be compatible. Thanks [~sravya] for verifying this. 

[~vinodkv] - do you think this is reasonable?, Attaching the patch here. , Okay, this got added at YARN-1628. Not sure if the test continues to work by only skipping core-site.xml from the jar. If it works, I am fine.

This message is automatically generated., Test failure on this run looks like unrelated to YARN-1628. And I believe as long as the core-site.xml is in the resources, tests shouldnt really require to have the test jar packaging it right, as the test itself wouldnt even use its own test jar?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Looks fine to me. Ran the test locally too and it works.

Assigning this to you. And checking this in.

We should do the incompatible change of moving the MiniYARNCluster class sometime in the future., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Sravya!, Great, thanks Vinod!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5257 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5257/])
