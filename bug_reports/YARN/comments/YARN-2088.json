[Bug and fixes:
1. clear builder before adding Set/Lists
2. remove unnecessary maybeInitBuilder in mergeLocalToBuilder
3. we don't need to construct Iterable manually, just use guava library
4. the property limit is not set properly in mergeLocalToBuilder, this may cause the limit property be reset to Long.MAX...
5. add a test assertion in TestGetApplicationsRequest to verify the bug

Run the test on my local laptop, the test failed before the patch, and success after the patch. 
, Based on recent bugs related to api records/PBImpl, I have some doubts about the general patterns used in PBImpls(java fields mixed with proto objects, cached states), which causes lots of redundant code and confusion, changes to those code is a mental challenge and can easily generate new bugs...
, +1

I guess the failure before this patch is caused by builder.clearApplicationTags() being not called in setApplicationTags() or mergeLocalToBuilder().

2 lines as below could be cleaned away too.
{code}
 public GetApplicationsRequestProto getProto() {
     mergeLocalToProto();
-    proto = viaProto ? proto : builder.build();
-    viaProto = true;
     return proto;
 }
{code}

, Hi Zhiguo, Thanks for the comments, nice catch.
Those two lines are used in every record class... so delete them in a single place actually break code conversion, and it's not related to this jira.
We may discuss whether to delete them all in other jira.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~djp], could you help review this patch?  I am doing YARN-2051, and it depend on this code, else the test is failed., LGTM(non-binding)., The new unit  is failing without this change is because the equals() method also calls getProto() which adds the fields into proto again, right ?, I think we should just simply call "builder.clear()" instead of clearing each property individually. [~decster], can you just apply this one line change (with removing some clearing individual properties) and your unit test. Other code is convention change and we can do it separately (with other PBImpl together)?, bq. I think we should just simply call "builder.clear()" instead of clearing each property individually.
Just think again. This is not correct as it will cause values in proto get lost even not update in this time. Please ignore this., bq. The new unit is failing without this change is because the equals() method also calls getProto() which adds the fields into proto again, right ?
