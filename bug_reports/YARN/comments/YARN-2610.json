This message is automatically generated., Why is the change specific to some tags and not the others?, I would have been fine with changing all the tags to close cleanly, except for the feedback from MAPREDUCE-2993.  So, I limited these changes to just the table rendering ones--which tends to cause the most problems anyhow.

Or is there some table related tag that I missed?, I just ran all YARN tests with the latest patch to be safe. None of the test failures are related.

+1. I ll commit this later today if no one objects. , [~rchiang], I did not see the comments on that MAPREDUCE-2993 before. Just wanted to know the reason behind leaving some tags open.
The patch looks good to me.
+1 (non-binding), Checking this in.. , Just committed this to trunk and branch-2.

Thanks for fixing this, Ray. , FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6154 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6154/])
