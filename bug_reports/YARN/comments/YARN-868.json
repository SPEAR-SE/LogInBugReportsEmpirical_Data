This message is automatically generated., Changes made are as under :
1. Provided an additional interface Token#getServiceAddress() to get Service address from token.
2. Stored server address(RM's) in ApplicationClientProtocolPBClientImpl. This address is set in TokenPBImpl while the GetDelegationResponse is being prepared from ResponseProto. This would let us store the address of RM which served this get delegation token request.
3. As service address field exists in TokenPBImpl but not in TokenProto, made suitable changes in tests.
, Another approach to resolve it could have been as under :
1. Make changes in TokenProto as well and return service address from Server(RM). But as TokenProto is defined in hadoop-common and used across projects, didnt make this change.  
2. Token is also part of requests, ideally we should have a separate class for Response flow, containing Token and Service Address. But this would break the interface YarnClient#getRMDelegationToken, hence didnt make this change either., [~vinodkv] Mind taking a look? , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~varun_saxena], thanks for working on this! I agree with [~djp] that more background information would be helpful. (/cc [~hitesh]). Overall, I think the patch LGTM, but I would like to make sure a few things:
# Do we want to mark the newly added getServiceAddress to be public and stable (especially when we have a private and unstable setter)? 
# I'm not familiar with the background of this JIRA, but how is the default port 8080 chosen in the tests? 
# There are some unrelated formatting changes. 
# Since we're adding a new field in tokens, do you think it's worthwhile to add special test cases on the system working with old token formats? We may not want to simply exempt them in the tests but define a standard behavior for them. Personally, I think this is important to keep rolling upgrade feature safe. 

I'm open in discussion in your design choices for all these points, of course. , Thanks [~djp] and [~gtCarrera9] for reviewing this.

To give you a background, refer to linked [file in Tez|https://github.com/apache/tez/blob/master/tez-mapreduce/src/main/java/org/apache/tez/mapreduce/client/ResourceMgrDelegate.java].
Here as you can see, Tez needs service address while getting Delegation token This address is currently taken from the config {{yarn.resourcemenager.address}} instead of the actual RM address which returned the token in case of HA.
I am not aware though about what Tez does with this service address though. Hitesh can probably throw some light on that.

Coming to other comments,
bq. Do we want to mark the newly added getServiceAddress to be public and stable (especially when we have a private and unstable setter)?
True, I will mark it as public and unstable.

bq.Since we're adding a new field in tokens, do you think it's worthwhile to add special test cases on the system working with old token formats? We may not want to simply exempt them in the tests but define a standard behavior for them. Personally, I think this is important to keep rolling upgrade feature safe.
The change in token applies only to client side. I haven't changed TokenProto so token transferred over wire would still remain same. I did not create a new class to incorporate this change to maintain API backwards compatible. Let me know if you feel differently.

Will fix checkstyle and whitespace issues., bq. This address is currently taken from the config yarn.resourcemenager.address instead of the actual RM address which returned the token in case of HA.
Hmm...this is an interesting case. We just had some discussions to get RM address from configuration in HA case (see discussion at YARN-3423). Does that can help in Tez case?
, [~djp], looked at {{WebAppUtils#getResolvedRemoteRMWebAppURLWithoutScheme}}. This function relies on redirect to get you to correct RM in HA case. This hence wont work in this case IIUC.
I can probably update a patch for further comments.

, bq. how is the default port 8080 chosen in the tests?
Its just a randomly chosen port, Sure. Thanks for clarifying on this. Will back to your patch soon., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. Either the client should set this information into the token or the client layer should expose an api that returns the service address.
IIUC, [~hitesh], what you need is is an API to get the service address for the RM delegation token ? {{ClientRMProxy.getRMDelegationTokenService(conf);}} now does that; MapReduce is  changed to use that. 
Is that enough for Tez? or you want YarnClient to set that automatically when get RMDelegationToken?
, [~varun_saxena] Sorry - this completely dropped off my radar. Looking at the patch and the current code, I tried to take a different approach and came up with a patch. 

[~vinodkv] Mind taking a look at patch 02 and 03 and giving your comments. , [~varun_saxena] to add to your previous comment, yes and yes. I also made the ClientRMProxy api public given that it is currently unstable. , Sorry - mixed contents on the previous comments. There are 2 issues:
   - the service address should be set in tokens handed back to user-code by the framework itself
   - the user-code should not need to pass in the renewer string when requesting a token 

patch 2 seems to try address the former and patch 3 is my attempt to fix the latter. 

\cc [~vvasudev] [~vinodkv] for comments 
, Removed patch 3 for now - discovered basic errors/wrong assumptions on the serviceAddr/renewer , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
