[This was broken by YARN-2503, as it changed _r to _ for the active users page and thus caused the HTML to be escaped rather than passed raw., It looks like YARN-2503 (inadvertently?) moved the _r from active users to the labels.  I don't see why we would want to pass labels as raw HTML, so I moved the _r from labels and back to active users.

[~leftnoteasy] could you take a look and verify label text should not be sent as raw HTML?, [~jlowe], you're correct, this is a bug caused by YARN-2503. Will create a cluster and try this patch, will get back to you once I have done.

thanks Jason for pointing this out !, Just tried this, without this JIRA, "Active users" has some abnormal characters, with this patch, "Active users" is expected.

+1 for this fix, thanks!, Committed to trunk and branch-2.  thanks Jason !, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6606 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6606/])
