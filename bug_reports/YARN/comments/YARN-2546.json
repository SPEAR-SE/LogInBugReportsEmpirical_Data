1. Make the app Id consistent?
{code}
  Response Body:

+---+
{
  "application-id":"application_1410870995658_0001",
  "maximum-resource-capability":
    {

      "vCores":32
    }

2. Maybe this change is not necessary? JAXBContextResolver can be added in another place.
{code}
-    WebResource r = resource();
+    ClientConfig cfg = new DefaultClientConfig();
+    cfg.getClasses().add(JAXBContextResolver.class);
+    Client client = Client.create(cfg);
+    client.addFilter(new LoggingFilter(System.out));
+    WebResource r = client.resource(resource().getURI());
{code}
This is what I did before in TestTimelineWebServices:
{code}
  public TestTimelineWebServices() {
    super(new WebAppDescriptor.Builder(
        "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.applicationhistoryservice.webapp")
        .contextListenerClass(GuiceServletConfig.class)
        .filterClass(com.google.inject.servlet.GuiceFilter.class)
        .contextPath("jersey-guice-filter")
        .servletPath("/")
        .clientConfig(
            new DefaultClientConfig(YarnJacksonJaxbJsonProvider.class))
        .build());
  }
