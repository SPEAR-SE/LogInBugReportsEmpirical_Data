, There was a build issue just fixed half a hour ago, hopefully this time it gets run., Hi [~yangjiandan] I just noticed the patch was for 2.8.2. 2.8.2 is already released, we should fix this in branch-2.8 instead. Can you try apply the same patch to branch-2.8 and rename the patch with sameÂ suffix? And do we have this issue on trunk? If so, we need a patch for trunk too., Thank [~cheersyang] for quick response.
There is no problem in trunk, because it replace ResourcePBImpl with LightWeightResource introduced by YARN-6909.
I will update a patch for branch-2.8, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~cheersyang] Jenkins is probably not OK.
Would you please fix it?, Hi [~yangjiandan] Yeah, seems like the jenkins env is broken on this branch, not sure why, I will check with some other folks about this. Will keep you posted !, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
