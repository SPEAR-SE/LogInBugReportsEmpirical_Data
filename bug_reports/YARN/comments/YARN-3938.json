[Hi [~leftnoteasy] .As i understand {{ labelManager.getResourceByLabel(RMNodeLabelsManager.NO_LABEL, clusterResource)}} will return {{0}} that is the reason its going wrong. Please correct me if i am wrong. Any thoughts?
, Hi [~bibinchundatt],
Thanks for reporting this issue, this is a known issue of node label. Possible solutions:
# Make {{maxAMResource = queue's-total-guaranteed-resource (Sum of queue's guaranteed resource on all partitions) * maxAmResourcePercent}}. It will be straightforward, but also can lead to too many AMs launched under a single partition.
# Make maxAMResource computed per queue per partition, this can make AM usages under partitions are more balanced, but can also lead to hard debugging (My application get stuck because of AMResourceLimit for a partition is violated).

I prefer 1st solution since it's easier to understand and debug.

Thoughts?

And could I take over this issue if you haven't get started?, I just found I filed one JIRA for this issue before, which is YARN-3216. Closing this as duplicated. Thanks for reporting, [~bibinchundatt].]
