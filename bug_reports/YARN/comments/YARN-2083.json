This message is automatically generated., I think it would be better to solve this by making sure the queue cannot actually exceed the maxResources limit.  I.e. to also check the constraint *after* picking a container that would be assigned., I think "precheck" is better than "aftercheck". And I think we could not do more check because we don't know the schedule application' information in assignContainerPreCheck function , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., could anyone review this patch?, Fix version is set at the time of commit by the committer depending on what branches they committed it to. , [~tianyi], here are some comments.
1. The tab size should be 2 characters .
{code}
public static boolean fitsInWithoutEqual(Resource smaller, Resource bigger) {
    return smaller.getMemory() < bigger.getMemory() &&
            smaller.getVirtualCores() < bigger.getVirtualCores();
}
{code}

2. Some lines in testAssignContainerPreCheck function are over 80 characters. We like to keep lines to max 80 characters.

3. IMO, the objective of testAssignContainerPreCheck function is used to verify whether the preCheck can work well when resourceUsage is smaller/euqal/larger than maxResource. We may need to add some testcases in this function.

4. Another nitty comment: there is one unnecessary line at the end of the TestFSLeafQueue.java., Thanks [~ywskycn] [~kasha], Here is the final patch file., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, [~tianyi]. Here are more comments.
Could we move the test code to a new file TestFSQueue.java, as the evaluated function is located in FSQueue.

{code}
    boolean couldAssignMoreContainer = schedulable.assignContainerPreCheck(
        new FSSchedulerNode(fakeNode, true));
{code}
We don't need to create a new FSSchedulerNode each time. Just create one.

some nitty comments: (1) for comment style, I may much prefer "// Test the..." instead of "//test the...". You can check the other comments in the code.
(2) Not need to create "couldAssignMoreContainer", just directly put the assignContainerPreCheck function inside the assertTrue/False., move test code to TestFSQueue.java, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Firstly, thanks for working on this long-standing issue. 

Correct me if I am wrong. Ideally, the check should be {{currentUsage + newContainerCapacity <= maxShare}}. Changing it from {{currentUsage <= maxShare}} to {{currentUsage < maxShare}} could address some cases, but not all the cases. Can we look at fixing it for all cases, moving the place assignContainerPreCheck is called if need be. ]
