[The extra time appears to be all client-side processing in the browser.  The browser is complaining about a script taking too long:

A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, open the script in the debugger, or let the script continue.

Looks like this was introduced by YARN-3840., Now that YARN-3840 has been reverted we can address the performance issues in that original JIRA.  Closing as a duplicate.]
