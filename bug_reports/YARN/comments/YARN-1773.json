Do not have bandwidth to fix it, in short term.

I have unassigned it in case somebody else wants to take it up. Will assign it back to myself once I have bandwidth and if nobody else has taken it up., bq. Do not have bandwidth to fix it, in short term.
Sure. no worry about it.

bq. Being able to encode the error in the ShuffleHeader will let us parse out the error correctly and move on to the remaining data.
