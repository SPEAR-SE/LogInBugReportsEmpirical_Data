This message is automatically generated., The patch looks almost good, just one small nit: In constructor,
{code}
    this.maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent = 
        cs.getConfiguration().
            getMaximumApplicationMasterResourcePerQueuePercent(getQueuePath());
{code}
maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent is set again in maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent. Though it does no harm now, it's still good to avoid setting the variable twice., Thanks a lot Zhijie for looking into the patch.

This message is automatically generated., [~zjshen], could you check the latest patch when you find some time, Thnx., +1. looks good to me, Patch looks good to me too. To make it perfect, can you add a LeafQueue.getMaxAMResourcePerQueuePercent() method and directly validate the am-resource-percent in the test-case?
