{noformat}, Straightforward patch to add support for REBOOTING, DECOMMISSION, and EXPIRE events for UNHEALTHY nodes., Patch is targeted for trunk/2.x.  I see branch-0.23 is missing support for CLEANUP_APP and CLEANUP_CONTAINER which were added as part of MAPREDUCE-3533, so we should add handling of those events in the branch-0.23 patch if we're not going to pull in MAPREDUCE-3533., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Patch for branch-0.23 which includes the missed handling of CLEANUP_APP and CLEANUP_CONTAINER which was already in trunk., The changes look good +1.  

I am a bit curious about the DECOMMISSIONED and REBOOTED states.  Is it possible for a CLEANUP_APP, or CLEANUP_CONTAINER event to show up after the node has transitioned to these states?  If this is an issue we can address it on a separate JIRA., Thanks Jason,

I put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2720 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2720/])

, bq. I am a bit curious about the DECOMMISSIONED and REBOOTED states. Is it possible for a CLEANUP_APP, or CLEANUP_CONTAINER event to show up after the node has transitioned to these states?

It definitely can receive CLEANUP_APP as I've seen that exact case in an RM log.  That event is sent to all nodes that ran containers for an application when the application completes.  CLEANUP_CONTAINER could be received if the container expires just as the node transitions to UNHEALTHY.  So I believe it's appropriate to handle these events in the UNHEALTHY state., It would also be nice to change it so that when an invalid transition happens in the node that more then just an error is logged, but I am not really sure what else it should do.  So adding in those transitions are probably not that critical.]
