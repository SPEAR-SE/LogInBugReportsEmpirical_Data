[This is interesting. In trunk today, the HDFS clients do not require instantiating a HdfsConfiguration instance manually. They are auto-loaded by the classes that get loaded for HDFS FS. Similar should be done by YARN, given we use YARN client classes to interact with YARN anyway?

Regarding the error message improvements, can you file a new JIRA with what you get and what to expect rather?, Closing this out as this was addressed as part of YARN-277.]
