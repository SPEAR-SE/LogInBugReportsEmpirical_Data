[The problem is that the fields are set not to include other info, such that that the entity has null other info map. The secondary filter is matched after the entity is loaded. It tries to compare with null other info map, and results in NPE.

The fix is to always include primary filters and other info into the fields if secondary filters are non-empty for matching, and remove them from the entity before returning it back to the caller., \\
