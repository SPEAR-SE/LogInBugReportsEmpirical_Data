This message was automatically generated., Findbugs warning can be skipped as exception handling is done in another method in WebServices.java and giving here as false positive. 

Existing test case in TestAHSWebServices covers this scenario., Hi, Hi [~zjshen]
I checked the patch and the tests are getting passed now. Please check if this is fine., +1 LGTM

No more test case is required, while the existing one covers the code already.

Will commit the patch., Committed the patch to trunk/branch-2. Thanks, Sunil!, Thank you [~zjshen] for committing the patch!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7952 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7952/])
