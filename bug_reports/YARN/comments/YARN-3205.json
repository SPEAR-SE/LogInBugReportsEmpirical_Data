{code}
+      Assert.assertTrue(store.fs.getConf() == store.fsConf);
{code}

I think we should validate that fs instance isn't same before restarting.
{code}
// Pseudo code
FileSystem beforeRestartFs = store.fs;
store.stop();
store.start();
Assert.assertNotEquals(store.fs, beforeRestartFs)
{code}
, [~ozawa], thanks for the review. That is a very good suggestion.
I uploaded a new patch YARN-3205.001.patch which addressed your comment.
The only difference is I didn't call stop because stop will call closeInternal to close the fs, which will make the test pass without the change., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
