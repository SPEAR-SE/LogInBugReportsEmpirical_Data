[Is yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec configured to a non-zero value?  If so that would readily explain why the containers are not being cleaned up., do you have application / nm / rm logs here? also was the above configuration parameter configured?, I was not setting yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec to 0. I will retest with above property set to 0. And also submit nm and rm logs if reproduced., No you don't need to explicitly set it to 0, as the default value is 0., Setting yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec solves the issue.
