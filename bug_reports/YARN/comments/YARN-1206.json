[Haven't reproduced this myself on trunk, but will trust Jian. The presumed issue is not happening on 2.1 on though as this patch is absent., I observed "Container does not exist." for the containers whose Map/Reduce task is completed, but the whole MR application is still running, We have seen case where upon enabling log aggregation, container link are broken because logs are aggregated to HDFS. If link is not updated to point ot history server, those will be broken links. Broken here is to say that nodemangaer will not be able to display logs (since they are aggregated to hdfs)

One way to reproduce this is, run application to completion, then click application link, something like
http://hadoop-rm-host:port/cluster/app/application_1379365648572_0001

Then click on 'logs' link next to ApplicationMaster attempt. This will point to page on NM displaying the below message
"Failed while trying to construct the redirect url to the log server. Log Server url may not be configured
Unknown container. Container either has not started or has already completed or doesn't belong to this node at all."
, Hi [~lohit], thanks for clarifying, here the situation is that log aggregation is disabled., Did this work differently prior to YARN-649?  My impression was that this was the existing behavior., Yeah, it worked., I haven't seen much progress here, [~jianhe] I'm inclined to move this to 2.4? Thoughts? Thanks., I remember this was working on branch-2, but failed on trunk, it should be fine,  I am able to reproduce this issue in today's trunk with log aggregation disable. I verified hadoop-2.1 , this issue does not ocure.

I just going through fix for YARN-649, found there is null check for container in ContainerLogsUtils.getContainerLogDirs() method.
{noformat}
   if (container == null) {
      throw new YarnException("Container does not exist.");
    }
{noformat}
In hadoop-2.1, above piece of code not there. I am not pretty sure why this is added.!!

Basically if container is COMPLETED  than it will be  removed from NMContext ( NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.updateAndGetContainerStatuses() ). NM does not have any information regarding this container. 

Is it really required to have this check ? , Attaching patch for fixing this issue. Please review, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch !  LGTM, can you add a comment say why we should not check container == null ?, Hi Jian, 
   Thank  you for looking into patch.

There are 2 scenarios.
1. When Container is Running, NM maintains all running container from NMContext. Accessing container logs link is validated by getting container from NMContext(container == null ) which works fine.

2. When Container is Completed, NM removes completed container from NMContext(NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.removeCompletedContainersFromContext()).  After application is finished, accessing container logs link tying to validate containerId from NMContext which is already removed in heartbeat.

When log aggregation is disabled, request for container log view forwarded to NM. But NM does not have completed container list. So, for already finished containers, we need not to check for null.
 , I added comment in ContainerLogsUtils.getContainerLogDirs() as below.
"It is not required to have null check for container ( container == null ) and throw back exception.Because when container is completed, NodeManager remove container information from its NMContext.Configuring log aggregation to false, container log view request is forwarded to NM. NM does not have completed container information,but still NM serve request forreading container logs."

This message is automatically generated., [~jianhe], can you look this in the context of YARN-1685 and see if these two patches go together?, Okay, never mind, they are completely orthogonal., LGTM, tested on single node cluster and also in the case of RM restart, patch works properly. Thanks Rohith !, Committed to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.4.  Thanks Rohith!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5346 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5346/])

, Note I'm not sure this problem is localized to just the log aggregation disabled case.  As Zhijie commented earlier, the logs are unavailable even with log aggregation enabled if you try to examine them after the container completes but before the entire application completes (and therefore log aggregation kicks in to move the logs to HDFS).  I believe this patch will fix that case as well but have yet to verify., Thanks for pointing it out, I believe the patch should also fix that.
