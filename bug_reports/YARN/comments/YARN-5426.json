[Isn't this already possible using the {{-shell_env}} CLI option?  Are you proposing adding in a switch, like {{-docker <image>}}, that would encapsulate setting {{-shell_env YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_TYPE=docker -shell_env YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_IMAGE=<image>}}?, Yeah, specifying those params is inconvenient. Also, those param names need not be visible to the user. Moreover, maybe have the ability to specify different types of images for several containers even with location requirement. In short, I think making docker container first-class thing in distributed shell is useful for testing docker-based services on YARN in the long term]
