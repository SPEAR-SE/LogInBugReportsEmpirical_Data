This message is automatically generated., This change looks reasonable to me. +1(non-binding)., I think it's weird to have a nodemanager property impact what goes on in the ResourceManager. Using this property would be especially weird on heterogeneous clusters where resources vary from node to node.  Preferable would be to, independently of yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-mb, make the ResourceManager reject any requests that are larger than the largest node in the cluster.  And then default yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocaiton-mb to infinite. , I agree with [~sandyr] on deriving the value., {quote}

Make sense. [~gopalv], do you mind updating yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocaiton-mb to infinite?, It's not just weird, but it's broken on heterogeneous clusters. The right fix is a dup of YARN-56.]
