[Attach a patch to avoid this error., Thanks for the report and the patch!  Looking at the patch, I'm not a fan of letting an NPE occur then catching it and assuming we know where the NPE came from.  It's error prone for maintenance since someone could accidentally introduce another NPE problem and then we are catching and suppressing for the wrong reason making things harder to debug.

Speaking of repressing exceptions, this simply logs a warning when we have no visibility, but then it just continues.  What will happen to the resource after that?  It doesn't look like we add it to any localizer list and therefore I think the container will just hang waiting for a resource to localize that never will.

A better way to handle this is to sanity-check the container launch request in ContainerManagerImpl#startContainerInternal and throw an exception if the request is malformed.  This has the benefit of propagating the error back to the client who is making the bad request so they know both that the request was bad and the corresponding container will not be launched.  This looks similar to YARN-6403, and the resource visibility was missed in that change., [~jlowe] Thanks for your suggestion.
It seems that -[YARN-6403|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-6403]-  is similar to this error. I also find that the resource type is null will cause this error, so I add resource visibility and type check after it.

Update patch., Thanks for updating the patch!  Looks good to me, moving this to Patch Available so Jenkins can comment on the patch., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
