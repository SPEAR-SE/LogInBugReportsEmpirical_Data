[It's a little difficult to line up the source with that stacktrace.  The report says it's happening on 2.7.1, but I could not get the line numbers to match up on that release.  My guess at this point is that there is at least one app on the cluster that has not set an application type (i.e.: app type is null) and therefore this code in WebServices.java is going to NPE when it tries to dereference the application type to trim it:
{code}
      if (checkAppTypes &&
          !appTypes.contains(
              StringUtils.toLowerCase(appReport.getApplicationType().trim()))) {
{code}

Looks like there's a missing null check on that.  It would be good to verify there are results in the original, non-filtered query that are returning "null", empty, or missing <type> tags for an application which would explain why we're hitting the NPE when we go to filter on it.]
