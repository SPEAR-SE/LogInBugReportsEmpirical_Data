[[~pramachandran] Could you take a look at my solution in my wip patch, I tried to solve this problem by pass a functor into the getEntities()call in TimelineReader, and inside LeveldbTimelineStore I check  acl before add each entity. 
Also I am about to write a unit test, where should I put this unit test?

I develop it against branch-2. I couldn't reproduce this scenario on my single node machine. But I am trying to write a unit test to test it.

This message is automatically generated., [~lichangleo], Couple more minor things with this patch

* LeveldbTimelineStore, MemoryTimelineStore, and TimelineReader all have extra UserGroupInformation import
* Spacing issues
** 'Check{' should be written as 'Check {'
** 'ugi=callerUGI;' should be written as 'ugi = callerUGI;'
** 'throws IOException{' should be written as 'throws IOException {'
* check logic simplification

{code}
      try {
        if (!timelineACLsManager.checkAccess(
          ugi, ApplicationAccessType.VIEW_APP, entity)) {
          return false;
        }
      }
{code}

might be simpler as

{code}
      try {
          return timelineACLsManager.checkAccess(
              ugi, ApplicationAccessType.VIEW_APP, entity);
      } 
{code}

* reduce logging level

{code}
      } catch (YarnException e) {
        LOG.error("Error when verifying access for user " + ugi
          + " on the events of the timeline entity "
          + new EntityIdentifier(entity.getEntityId(),
          entity.getEntityType()), e);
        return false;
      }
{code}
