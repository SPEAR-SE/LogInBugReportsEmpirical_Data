This message is automatically generated., This looks good, Chuan.  I confirmed that the test passes on both Mac and Windows for both trunk and branch-2.

Once again, there was a minor formatting difference between trunk and branch-2.  I'm attaching a new version of the branch-2 patch that removes some unused imports and changes some spacing.  This will make the file identical between trunk and branch-2.  Does this still look good to you?  If so, then I'll commit it., +1 Thanks for correcting the format!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
