[It appears the RM doesn't have the ACLs corresponding to an application from {{RMContext#getRMApps()}}. We couldn't reproduce this. The cluster had RM failover with app recovery. 

Couldn't identify the source of this through visual inspection. This can happen when the RM goes down (or restarted, or failed over) between adding the app and adding the ACLs for the app. If that were the case, I see the following solutions:
# If ACLs are not available, use the default value. 
# Reverse the order of adding an app to ACLsManager and RMContext. , That doesn't sound right. When RM recovers, it just simply puts the app back into *both* the context and the acls manager. Can you debug more?, Okay, I think I know the issue. Working on a patch.., The problem is that the web-services cache the acls-managers from the 'previous' RM. The acls-manager are recreated when a transition happens.

Here's a patch to fix the issue
 - Changed web-services to not cache the application and queue acls-managers. I checked other instances in the web-app. These seem like the only two cached objects.
 - The code in the main ResourceManager has become unmaintenable after the introduction of the active-services. I had to resist cleaning up, quite a few things are broken in more ways than one. For now, moved a couple of things from the top level to be nested inside active-services. Will file a ticket for more cleanup.
 - Fixed few existing formatting issues
 - The test case fails without the code change with the same exception printed above and passes with., Thanks Vinod. Looking at the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

bq. The code in the main ResourceManager has become unmaintenable after the introduction of the active-services.
Agree. I have been thinking of it too. I think we should just move RMActiveServices into its own file - that would force us to clean up the unwieldy mess it has become. Filed YARN-1874 to do the same. Feel free to pick it up. I can take a stab, may be in a week or two.

That said, it would be nice to address all the cleanup changes there, particularly if they are not related to the bug we are fixing here.

Also, we should probably limit the formatting changes to the files that have non-formatting changes. May be leave out RMContextImpl?, bq. That said, it would be nice to address all the cleanup changes there, particularly if they are not related to the bug we are fixing here.

I originally had lot more changes, but got rid of all those.

A little bit of cleanup per patch should be okay. I'd like to keep them here unless you feel strongly that it is prohibiting the review.

The attached patch was for 2.4. Updating a new one for trunk., Patch for trunk., bq. A little bit of cleanup per patch should be okay. I'd like to keep them here unless you feel strongly that it is prohibiting the review.
I am not very particular about it - the patch is fairly small and those changes don't get in the way of review. I am okay with leaving them in, if you insist. My only concern is the git history wouldn't tell us why we made these changes if we hide them behind a bug fix. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
