[attaching premlinary patch showing all the metrics. , Hi [~adhoot], does it make sense to share some common metrics infrastructure with the capacity scheduler on this?  Some metrics along these lines were recently added, [YARN-3293], perhaps the additional ones you have here can be added in & those from the other side populated for FairScheduler as well, with some of the implementation shared?, Took a look at YARN-3293. All the metrics there were added on a global level for the Scheduler, while this jira is adding per queue metrics that integrates into the existing per queue metrics framework. I think adding the YARN-3293 can be complementary to this and should be done for FairScheduler as well. Opened YARN-3890 for doing that.]
