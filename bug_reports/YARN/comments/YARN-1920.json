This message is automatically generated., Putting more context: The test-failure is  happening because the test before the failing test wasn't deleting the file successfully due to the file-handle leak. In all the tests in this test-case, we always expect that a new history-store file to be created for each of the tests and due to the leak, that assumption was violated. The leak was leaving the stream open and so the file couldn't be deleted, though it works fine on Linux/Mac.
, The reason of the file sounds right to me. The patch looks good as well. I made a minor change to the patch to make each LOG.error to record the exception instance. Will commit it once Jenkins +1, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
