, [~leftnoteasy], cherry-picked YARN-5719 into branch-2. One more issue in code seems to be that we calculate strlen on every iteration of for loop, which would be suboptimal., [~varun_saxena], thanks for cherry-picking YARN-5719, as mentioned by Jason, I just pushed YARN-7014 to branch-2 as well. 

The strlen issue is fixed by YARN-6852 in trunk, probably we can add a separate fix as well.]
