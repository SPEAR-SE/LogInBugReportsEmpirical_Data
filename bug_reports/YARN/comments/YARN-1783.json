{code}, The problem is that while NM is resyncing with RM, NM will clean the finished containers from its context before it processes the resync command. But the RM is still waiting for previous AM container Finished event from NM after it restarts,  so that it knows to launch a new attempt., The patch splits the getContainerStatus and removeCompletedContainers logic in the original method getNodeStatusAndUpdateContainersInContext, and put the removeCompletedContainers after the nodeStatusUpdater gets the resync command.

Rewrote TestNodeStatusUpdater.testCompletedContainerStatusBackup() as that test case was broken., The new added test passed with the core code change and failed without the core change., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The logic to handle NodeAction.RESYNC looks good to me. But there will be one more issue.  It is very possible that there is one container whose state is not completed when we generate NodeStatus and send to RM, but after we receive the response, the state of this container become COMPLETE. In this patch, we will remove all the completed containers. In this case, we will remove this container from context, and this containerâ€™s status will be missed., Thanks for catching this !
The new patch creates a separate collection for recording the previous completed containers when getNodeStatus is called and remove containers from context only for those completed containers., +1 LGTM, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The explanation for the bug sounds correct.

Some comments on the patch:

h4. NodeStatusUpdaterImpl
 - previousCompletedContainers: put a java comment explaining its usage
 - getContainerStatuses()
    -- put a java comment similar to the above
    -- Not a bug, but this.context.getContainers() can change between the time you get the size and get the values.
 - Even though, NodeStatusUpdaterImpl is single threaded, removeCompletedContainersFromContext should have locking to avoid previousCompletedContainers changing potentially by another thread - for future-safety.
 - Move the {{previousCompletedContainers.isEmpty}} check also into the method {{removeCompletedContainersFromContext}}
 - rebootNodeStatusUpdater() -> rebootNodeStatusUpdaterAndRegisterWithRM()

h4. NodeStatusUpdater
 - getNodeStatus() API can be dropped from the interface, nobody outside uses it.

h4. TestNodeManagerResync
 - containerStatusesForTest is unused
 - Add javadoc for the test
 - Move all the methods from the anonymous class extending TestNodeStatusUpdaterResync to be in the class itself
 - Add more verification in MockResourceTracker to validate that
    -- on the first register, there are no container-statuses
    -- on the first heartbeat, NM gets a resync
    -- on the second register, NM reports the previously completed container

h4. TestNodeStatusUpdater
 - Can you add a comment to MyNMContext and MyNodeStatusUpdater2 on what they do?
 - I liked the original way of explicitly validating the states of each container. Can we go back to that?, bq. Move all the methods from the anonymous class extending TestNodeStatusUpdaterResync to be in the class itself
I intentionally create the new TestNodeStatusUpdaterResync class as that can be used as a common base class for testing NM resync behavior. The other methods in the anonymous class is test specific.  Put a comment also.
