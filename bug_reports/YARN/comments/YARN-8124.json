[I haven't seen this issue when testing trunk. Can you tell me a bit more about your environment? The AM should be getting a system property LOG_DIR set to <LOG_DIR> which is expanded in ContainerLaunch., I am seeing this error in OSX with sample sleep service.  I also see from process status that -DLOG_DIR is set to container userlog dir. Not sure why it didn't resolve this patch. Need to debug more on this. ]
