[CS's reinitialize logic creates new queues, but only copies configuration properties to old queue, and new queue will be discarded after reinitialization.

A comprehensive fix for this is, copy old queue's run time information to new queue, including runningApplications, etc. And discard old queue after reinitialization.

A short term fix is don't allow remove queue under parentQueue. IAW, CS will throw exception if a LeafQueue is moved from one parent to another. I prefer to do comprehensive fix for 2.8.0, and short term fix for 2.7.1/2.6.1 (if required).

Thoughts?, Following test case can verify this issue:

{code}
  @Test
  public void testQueueParsingWithMoveQueue()
      throws IOException {
    YarnConfiguration conf = new YarnConfiguration();
    CapacitySchedulerConfiguration csConf =
        new CapacitySchedulerConfiguration(conf);
    csConf.setQueues("root", new String[] { "a" });
    csConf.setQueues("root.a", new String[] { "x", "y" });
    csConf.setCapacity("root.a", 100);
    csConf.setCapacity("root.a.x", 50);
    csConf.setCapacity("root.a.y", 50);

    CapacityScheduler capacityScheduler = new CapacityScheduler();
    RMContextImpl rmContext =
        new RMContextImpl(null, null, null, null, null, null,
            new RMContainerTokenSecretManager(csConf),
            new NMTokenSecretManagerInRM(csConf),
            new ClientToAMTokenSecretManagerInRM(), null);
    rmContext.setNodeLabelManager(nodeLabelManager);
    capacityScheduler.setConf(csConf);
    capacityScheduler.setRMContext(rmContext);
    capacityScheduler.init(csConf);
    capacityScheduler.start();
    
    csConf.setQueues("root", new String[] { "a", "x" });
    csConf.setQueues("root.a", new String[] { "y" });
    csConf.setCapacity("root.x", 50);
    csConf.setCapacity("root.a", 50);
    csConf.setCapacity("root.a.y", 100);
    
    capacityScheduler.reinitialize(csConf, rmContext);
    
    Assert.assertEquals(1, ((ParentQueue) capacityScheduler.getQueue("a"))
        .getChildQueues().size());
  }
{code}, bq. A short term fix is don't allow remove queue under parentQueue.
We never supported removing queues. So this is not just a short-term fix, this is the right fix for now., [~vinodkv], agree. Update the title/desc and will search/file separated ticket for moving/removing queue., Attached initial patch for review., \\
