{code}, I think all the places where the resource info is added to html should be looked at (default scheduler, fair scheduler, capacity scheduler, ...).

Just curious, what is the "newbie" tag for?, For configuring capacity values, no need to put brackets, bq. Just curious, what is the "newbie" tag for?
"newbie" is marked to certain set of tickets which a new contributor can take up and learn that specific component. Usually simple tickets to fix. :), Sounds good. I'll submit a patch soon., Proposed patch for escaping invalid characters for html., By the way, the xml issue with the capacity scheduler should be fixed, but it's a somewhat separate problem that would call for a different solution (jaxb-specific). I think it should be a separate ticket., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I didn't add a new test because it is a small UI change. Let me know if you think this would need a new test., Thanks [~sjlee0] I would have liked to see web services related similar issues too to be fixed as a part of this ticket as that too is trivial and at least in case of capacity Scheduler we probably need to just remove "usedResources" from response....otherwise lgtm +1

{code}, Hmm, do you want to just remove the element from the XML? I thought that there is value in showing this field.

I agree that removing it would be trivial, but keeping it and properly escaping it seems a little more involved. We would want to escape only if it is an xml output (as opposed to json), and that may involve playing with jaxb marshalling., Someone has already fixed it looks like but forgot to remove older...check "<usedResources><memory:0, vCores:0></usedResources>" and "<resourcesUsed>
<memory>0</memory>
<vCores>0</vCores>
</resourcesUsed>" .. this is trivial can be fixed here itself.. I think we can remove "usedResources", Oh I see. The memory and vcores are there instead? I didn't see that. Let me see if I can do add that change too. Give me a moment., Updated the patch to remove the unnecessary usedResources field., Thanks [~sjlee0] .. just a small request.. please number the patches like "<jira-number><date(yyyymmdd).number" ... you can choose your own format but it will help reviewer ..lgtm +1, Oh OK... I've been following the suggestions in this wiki: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute :)
