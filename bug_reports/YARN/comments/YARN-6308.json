[bq. Yes, it looks like the changes in YARN-6218 conflict with this change. For example, in that commit, the method tearDown was renamed to teardown, so in this patch we call a method that doesn't exist anymore. Want me to make a separate patch to fix this?
[~Steven Rand] yes, please., Attached a new patch to HADOOP-14062, though I think this issue should have been fixed by the previous patch being reverted.]
