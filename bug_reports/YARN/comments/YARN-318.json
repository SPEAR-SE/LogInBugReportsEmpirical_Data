[Hyunsik, what should be the fix?, I didn't doubt the kill's bug because it is very common utility and it worked when I executed the command 'kill -0 -12127' on shell. However, accoring to this bug report (http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=688731), it was a bug of procps-ng. If we don't give the path of kill command, the command invokes the built-in 'kill' command of bash. So, it seemed working.
