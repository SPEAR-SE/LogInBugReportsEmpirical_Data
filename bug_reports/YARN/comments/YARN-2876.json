[Hi [~sandyr], Can you take a look at this? Although, this problem only affects observability, it would be great if we can get this right. So that, it would be less worrisome for users that things might go wrong with hierarchical queue structure. , {code}
+    if (maxShare.equals(Resources.unbounded())  && parent != null) {
+        return parent.getMaxShare();
{code}
If the parent queue is also not configured, so it still returns UNBOUNDED?, No, If parent queue is also not configured, it will keep querying their ancestor queue until one of them has configured maxResource. Unless root is also not configured, then this method will return UNBOUNDED., Oh, you're right, I misunderstood it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~leftnoteasy], I have uploaded patch v4 that added a test case, and the findbugs seems to be irrelevant to this patch, Thanks for the patch, [~l201514].  Any chance you'd like to update it for the current trunk?

Looks like the test only creates a single queue.  I'd rather see a configuration with parent and child queues so that the feature gets well exercised., Canceling patch until it's updated, Another quick note.  With this patch applied to trunk, I get consistent test failures:

Failed tests:
  TestFairScheduler.testChildMaxResources:504 App 1 is not running with the correct number of containers expected:<2> but was:<3>
  TestFairScheduler.testMoveWouldViolateMaxResourcesConstraints Expected exception: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnException
