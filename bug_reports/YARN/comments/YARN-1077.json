I will take a look at the failure., Cancelling patch while failures are being 'looked at'.

We'll forever be chasing these Windows test failures separately till we can setup public Windows builds., Also, instead of the following
{code}
-                      ExitCode.TERMINATED.getExitCode(),
+                      Shell.WINDOWS ? ExitCode.FORCE_KILLED.getExitCode() : 
+                        ExitCode.TERMINATED.getExitCode(),
{code}
Should we just change ExitCode.TERMINATED.getExitCode() to return the correct code depending on the OS? That way all future callers can simply work.

I've seen that pattern in other patches too, so saying., Attaching a new patch.

This is a really good idea! Can we deal with this in a separate JIRA. I don't want to increase the scope of the current patch., In the new patch, I removed the following code because writer is writing to shellFile but later the file outputsteam opens the file without append mode. So the code is simply dead code.

{code:java}
       shellFile = Shell.appendScriptExtension(tmpDir, "hello");
-      String timeoutCommand = Shell.WINDOWS ? "@echo \"hello\"" :
-        "echo \"hello\"";
-      PrintWriter writer = new PrintWriter(new FileOutputStream(shellFile));
-      FileUtil.setExecutable(shellFile, true);
-      writer.println(timeoutCommand);
-      writer.close();
       Map<Path, List<String>> resources =
           new HashMap<Path, List<String>>();
       FileOutputStream fos = new FileOutputStream(shellFile);

This message is automatically generated., While committing the original patch that added the "command not found" message (YARN-814), I kind of felt that it'd break Windows. But alas, no pre-commit Windows builds.

Assuming things are fine on Windows, +1 for the patch. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.1-beta. Thanks Chuan!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4361 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4361/])
