This is a one line change to remove the throw exception line because it was supposed to ignore the exception in first place., The protocol PB implementation actually has the close method.  e.g. {{ApplicationClientProtocolPBClientImpl#close}}. [~jlowe], how did you run into this ?
I changed this code while doing YARN-2613. I think this problem may be solved by that., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. The protocol PB implementation actually has the close method. e.g. ApplicationClientProtocolPBClientImpl#close. Jason Lowe, how did you run into this ?

Yes, this is an invalid report and a result of a misdiagnosis of the problem in MAPREDUCE-6125.  Due to the PBClientImpl magic all of the protocols get a close method automatically in practice.  The problem reported in MAPREDUCE-6125 occurred because the test was trying to mock a protocol and when the client tried to stop the mock it didn't have a close method.]
