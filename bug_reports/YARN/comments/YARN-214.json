This message is automatically generated., We don't want to kill containers that receive EXPIRE in the RUNNING state.  

The EXPIRE event is a watchdog for containers that are acquired but don't ever get up and running.  When they make it to the RUNNING state then we explicitly cancel the timer that would trigger the EXPIRE event.  In the real-world case we saw, the RM was processing events slowly, and so the LAUNCHED event wasn't pulled out of the event queue and processed before the timer expired and therefore we get the EXPIRE event in the RUNNING state.

In this case we should just ignore the EXPIRE event in the RUNNING state since the container is now running and there's no need to kill it.  Arguably, if we're backed up enough in processing events and the container exits quickly, we could get EXPIRE in the COMPLETED state as well., I changed the transition to a no-op and removed the app attempt captor since the app attempt isn't being modified now, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Now that I understand the code better I think that ignoring the EXPIRE at the RUNNING state makes since.  The EXPIRE event only happens when a container has been waiting in allocated for more then 10 min (default config).  This really would only happen when an App has gotten a container and forgotten about it, or when the RM is running very slow and not processed the transition events by the time the EXPIRE event is sent.

We register for the Expire event in the AquiredTransition going to the AQUIRED State, so we need to handle the EXPIRE event at all states that are reachable from the AQUIRED state, and have not already processed the Expire event.  This means we need to handle this in the KILLED, RUNNING, COMPLETED, and RELEASED.  We need to add this to KILLED and RELEASED too., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
