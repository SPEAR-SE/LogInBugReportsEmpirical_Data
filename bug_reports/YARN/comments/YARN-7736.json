*Role of AMRMProxy*
1. Protect the sub-cluster YARN RMs from misbehaving AMs. The AMRMProxy can prevent DDOS attacks by throttling/killing AMs that are asking too many resources.
2. Mask the multiple YARN RMs in the cluster, and can transparently allow the AM to span across sub-clusters. All container allocations are done by the YARN RM framework that consists of the AMRMProxy fronting the home and other sub-cluster RMs.
3. Intercepts all the requests, thus it can enforce application quotas, which would not be enforceable by sub-cluster RM (as each only see a fraction of the AM requests).
4. The AMRMProxy can enforce load-balancing / overflow policies.
