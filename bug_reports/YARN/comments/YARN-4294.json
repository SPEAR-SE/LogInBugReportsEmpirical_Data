This message was automatically generated., bq. -1	checkstyle	1m 38s	The applied patch generated 3 new checkstyle issues (total was 36, now 37).
The warning is caused by unused imports but the imports are actually used for compiling javadoc., +1. 
If you can track down the patch which broke this, can you link this up as "caused by". Just to keep that "what-broke-what" history up to date, +1, I've committed the patch to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] and [~ozawa] for reviews.
