[This looks like a duplicate of YARN-8457, and the fix was already picked to branch-3.0.  Seem slike we simply need to pick it to branch-3.0.3 and update the fix versions appropriately on that JIRA., Thanks [~jlowe], 

I was trying to put the fix there, and I found the same:-) I used this solution to update 3.0.3 artifacts without committing, since I don't want to change the commit tip of the 3.0.3 release which is out already.
