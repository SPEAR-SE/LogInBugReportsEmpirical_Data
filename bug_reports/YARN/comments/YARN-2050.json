[Papreduce CLI and yarn CLI pass the configuration to LogCLIHelpers. LogCLIHelpers use the same configuration to create remoteRootLogDir and remoteAppLogDir, etc. in dumpAllContainersLogs. The fix is to use the same configuration to create FileContext.

To follow up on [~jlowe]'s comments,

1. remoteAppLogDir.toUri().getScheme() returns null and AbstractFileSystem.createFileSystem doesn't like it if dumpAllContainersLogs calls FileContext.getFileContext(remoteAppLogDir.toUri()).

2. If caller of LogCLIHelpers doesn't setConf ahead of time, dumpAllContainersLogs will get null pointer exception when it tries to get remoteRootLogDir., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Argh right, I forgot that FileContext is less-than-helpful in this regard.   It needs to be something like this:

{code}
  Path qualifiedLogDir = FileContext.getFileContext(getConf()).makeQualified(remoteAppLogDir);
  FileContext fc = FileContext.getFileContext(qualifiedLogDir.toUri(), getConf());
  nodeFiles = fc.listStatus(qualifiedLogDir);
{code}

This allows the code to handle cases where the remote log dir has been configured to be a different filesystem than the default filesystem., Thanks, Jason. You are right. remoteAppLogDir could point to a different type of file system. Here is the updated patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
