Could you add test for regression?, Have tested the same manually as of now and is working fine .

transitionToActive: incorrect number of arguments
Usage : rmadmin [-transitionToActive [--forceactive] <serviceId>]

, bq. Have tested the same manually as of now and is working fine .

Thanks for testing this manually. Could you add the unit test for this ? Maybe add a unit test in TestRMAdminCLI ?, Adding a unit test for this is a waste of time, IMO. 

I'm much more curious why we are override the method rather than just changing the text directly.  Does anything else actually even use the method that's being overridden?  

(In general, having this method even exist seems like a strong case of over-engineering, which is pretty prevalent throughout Hadoop.), In addition, [~bibinchundatt], could you replace tabs in your patch to spaces?, Thank you [~aw],[~leftnoteasy],[~xgong] for looking into the patch. I have done the formatting required and have added test case in TestRMAdminCLI. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good over all.

But, is this new function really necessary ?
{code}
+  protected void setErrOut(PrintStream errOut) {
+    this.errOut = errOut;
+  }
{code}

If this one is only for testing purpose, probably we do not need it.
Please take a look at TestRMAdminCli.testHelp(). , [~xgong] I did look at the method but same way was not able to do. please do correct me if i am wrong

In HAAdmin the errOut is Initialized as below and used in function

{code}
public abstract class HAAdmin extends Configured implements Tool {
 /** Output stream for errors, for use in tests */
  protected PrintStream errOut = System.err;
  protected PrintStream out = System.out;
}
private void printUsage(PrintStream errOut, String cmd) {
	..	
    errOut.println("Usage: HAAdmin [" + cmd + " " + usage.args + "]");
  }
{code}

Error out gets initialized in Setup of TestRMAdminCli. So when tried to set Sys.err in test method didnt work out.
For {code}class DFSHAAdmin extends HAAdmin {code} also the same way its handled .DFSHAAdmin  have added method {color:red}setErrOut{color} for that too.

Another option is to set System.err in {color:red}Before{color} of  TestRMAdminCli before initializing *rmAdminCLIWithHAEnabled* variable. So hoping that current implementation is fine what do you say?

Sorry for making this so complex and thank you for taking care of it.
+1 for the patch. Will commit it., Committed to trunk/branch-2. Thanks. [~bibinchundatt] , FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7103 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7103/])
