[The httpd-proxy.conf file must be copied to HDFS before launching the app, as per the instructions: https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/markdown/yarn-service/Examples.md, Reopening this bug to improve error logging. The error message should specify that src file is missing from HDFS, YARN-7740 improved the error message to include information on which filesystem the src file is missing from. Feel free to reopen if you feel additional changes are needed.
