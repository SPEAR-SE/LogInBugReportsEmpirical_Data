[There is a release audit warning for the "Sorting icons.psd" file, but this file was not recently changed.  Instead it was triggered by the apache-rat plugin upgrade as part of HADOOP-10574.  Updating the JIRA summary accordingly., Easily fixed by adding another exclusion to {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/pom.xml}}. Shall I write the patch?, Feel free, Steve!  I was hoping to get to this later today, but I'd be happy to commit a patch if someone else gets to it first., -001.patch
