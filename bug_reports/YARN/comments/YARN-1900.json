This message is automatically generated., [~ozawa] Do we really need this fix ? 
Probably, we could add some commandline/api to allow user to dynamically set the yarn.log.server.url on the run time even when the NM is running ? In that case, even when we change the log server, we could still get the logs without restart the NM. 
Thoughts ? ]
