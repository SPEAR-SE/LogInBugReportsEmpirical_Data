This message was automatically generated., Thanks for working this. [~zjshen].
The patch looks good over.
One comment: Can we do the same thing for getAppAttempts and getContainers ?, bq. Can we do the same thing for getAppAttempts and getContainers ?

That's a good question. It depends on the isolation granularity. My opinion is that we set the isolation at the app level, such that app1's error doesn't affect that I access app2, app3 and so on. But anything error inside app1, such as corruption of one container and one attempt, should let user know. Thoughts?, Make sense. For getAttempts and get Containers, probably, instead of throwing the exception, we could create a blank page and say "the attempt/container does not exist". We could do it separately. The patch for this ticket is good enough.

+1. Will commit shortly, Committed into trunk/branch-2/branch-2.7. Thanks, zhijie, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7896 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7896/])
