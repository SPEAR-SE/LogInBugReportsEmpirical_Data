This message is automatically generated., I found these two fair-scheduler-allocation.xml :

./hadoop-tools/hadoop-sls/src/main/sample-conf/fair-scheduler-allocation.xml
./hadoop-tools/hadoop-sls/src/test/resources/fair-scheduler-allocation.xml

But they seem to have '<allocations>' as top-level element., The test failure should be solved by YARN-1300, +1. For now we don't have a big issue because of this, but we should fix it to make the code extendable., Is more review needed ?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~sandyr], do you have any comment about this JIRA? , I'm not super familiar with this code, but [~ywskycn] might be?, Sorry I missed this jira before.
I'll look into the patch. thanks., +1, the patch looks good to me. Looks also need to hold lock in the handle(SchedulerEvent schedulerEvent) function., Re-look the code. Do we really need to add a lock to lock the schedulerAllocateTimer? schedulerAllocateTimer is only updated in the allocate() function., Canceling patch to address [~ywskycn] comments.]
