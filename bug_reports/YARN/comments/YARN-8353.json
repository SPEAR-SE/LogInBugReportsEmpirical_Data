[Hi [~LongGang]

We have 2 types of resources. For internal handling in scheduler etc, we are using a {{LightWeightResource's}} instead of PBImpl object to avoid the  bulkiness and to improve performance. PBImpl is needed only when resource is talked to outside world. Hence it is different.

Now we can look into {{ContainerUpdateContext}} and ensure both api use same type objects.]
