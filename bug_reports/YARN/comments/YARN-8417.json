[Just to clarify - this is only for the ENTRY_POINT case, right?Â  For the non-ENTRY_POINT case, we are using a launch_container.sh script to specify environment variables, and for those in the NM whitelist, we specify them using the syntax that allows the value in the docker file to override it. e.g.:

{noformat}
JAVA_HOME=${JAVA_HOME:-/nm/java/home}
{noformat}

{quote}
For Docker container, it actually doesn't make sense to pass JAVA_HOME, HDFS_HOME, etc. because inside docker image we have a separate Java/Hadoop installed or mounted to exactly same directory of host machine.

In the non-ENTRY_POINT case, we need to support the ability for NM to set these if they are in the whitelist and they are not defined in the docker container, which is why we use the above syntax.
