[The RM needs to short-circuit the RPC loopback connection to itself, and directly/internally renew its own tokens.  I attempted to do this in the JT for 1.x, so I'll dig up the patch., Daryn - do you remember the JT jira?, Proposed patch that works on 23.  The RM token renewer will short out to a secret manager if configured with one and the token address is local.  Successfully tested on a secure cluster.

Trunk/branch-2 have moved files around caused dependency issues that I need to resolve., Renaming patch with correct jira id!, Things got shuffled on main and caused dependency woes.

Removed private renew/cancel from YarnClientImpl that essentially was commented as it shouldn't be there.  Moved renewer into identifier class like other tokens.  Added much better tests.  Otherwise it's pretty much the same as the original patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., {{NetUtils.isLocalAddress}} doesn't check ports, which would break an unlikely scenario - multiple RMs on the same host, with one RM renewing the other RM's tokens.
Other than that, the patch looks good., Cancelling till Sid's comments are addressed. Daryn, if you could fix it asap I'd appreciate it - it's one of the 2 hadoop-2.0.3 blockers... :) Thanks!, I did somewhat intentionally neglect checking the port since I was trying to post a minimal patch, and I thought it would be extremely unlikely and not make sense for two RMs to run on the same host.  I'll update it to check the port., Check token service addr against RM addr and correctly handles RM addr being a wildcard or not.  Also add more comprehensive tests., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Needs one fix, which I don't spot in the last review.

clientRM.getBindAddress() will end up getting null - since the value is only set after ClientRMService.init is called. Ideally, it needs to be called after the ClientRMService starts.

Other than this, looks good., Thanks Sid.  Updated patches to set TSM service after client has started., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
