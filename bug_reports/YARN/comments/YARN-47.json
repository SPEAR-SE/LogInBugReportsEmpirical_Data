[Resolving this very old umbrella JIRA. Security (auth + authz) has largely been nearly complete/stable in YARN since this ticket was opened. And as new requirements come in, we can open new tickets.
 - Will leave the open sub-tasks as they are.
 - Unassigning from me given multiple contributors on the tasks.
 - No fix-version as this was done across releases.]
