[[~kasha], [~templedf] I remember there're some perf issues in FS as well, better to move them under the same JIRA so we can handle common issues together?, [~leftnoteasy], YARN-6361is a FS performance issue but not related to CS, I think. Should it be added to the list?, [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com], sure go ahead :), I add two fair scheduler performance improvement JIRAs here. But I just realize there is one FairScheduler performance improvement umbrella YARN-5479. We may combine these two later.]
