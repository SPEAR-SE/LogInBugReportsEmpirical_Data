[Why was the size of nodelabel.mirror file, 0?  There must be something written to it, even if there are no labels. Right?, [~varun_saxena]

Looked into the code and did not find a case this could happen. Even if label list is  empty file size should not be empty.
But  the cause of failure for RM not starting in my laptop setup is due to node label mirror image size. Will try to reproduce the same.
We could  handle  file size 0 case also so that RM startup will not fail. Thoughts??
, We can make that check for robustness but my concern was that what could lead to this? And if there is a problem which causes mirror file size to be 0, probably a fix would be required there.]
