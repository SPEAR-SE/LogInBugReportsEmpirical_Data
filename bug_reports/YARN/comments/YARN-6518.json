[Thanks  [~cheersyang] for the patch,
    Simple modifications and Overall changes looks good enough to go in. Will wait for the jenkins report before committing., Mostly jenkins report is not displayed even after manual trigger ! may be HadoopQA was not in the watchers list... added it and reopned the patch. , Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for your review. Not sure why jenkins job still not work., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
