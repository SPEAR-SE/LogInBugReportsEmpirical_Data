[It is unclear if this is the same issue as YARN-4048 . Strict limits were not enabled here. , I think I can reproduce this on a VM. Assigning it to myself., We have met the same problem. We set yarn.nodemanager.resource.percentage-physical-cpu-limit=80 and tested both kernel version 2.6.32-642 and 3.10.103 with hadoop-2.7.1 by running Terasort, the kernel crashed.
Then we updated kernel version to 4.8.1, the kernel panic didn't happen any more. It seems that this kernel panic is due to kernel cgroup bug, which is fixed in higher kernel version. , Hi [~Tao Jie]

Have you analysed the vmcore dump file? Do you think it is a same issue reported in this bugzilla ticket https://bugzilla.linux.ibm.com/show_bug.cgi?id=128504]
