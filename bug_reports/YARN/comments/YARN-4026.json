This message was automatically generated., - why "assignment.setFulfilledReservation(true);" is called in Reserved state ?
{code}
      if (result.getAllocationState() == AllocationState.RESERVED) {
        // This is a reserved container
        LOG.info("Reserved container " + " application="
            + application.getApplicationId() + " resource=" + allocatedResource
            + " queue=" + this.toString() + " cluster=" + clusterResource);
        assignment.getAssignmentInformation().addReservationDetails(
            updatedContainer.getId(),
            application.getCSLeafQueue().getQueuePath());
        assignment.getAssignmentInformation().incrReservations();
        Resources.addTo(assignment.getAssignmentInformation().getReserved(),
            allocatedResource);
        assignment.setFulfilledReservation(true);
      } else {

{code}
-  I think here can always return ContainerAllocation.LOCALITY_SKIPPED as the semantics of this method is to try to allocate a container for certain locality. 
{code}
      return type == NodeType.OFF_SWITCH ? ContainerAllocation.APP_SKIPPED
          : ContainerAllocation.LOCALITY_SKIPPED;
{code}
The caller here can choose to return APP_SKIPPED if it sees the LOCALITY_SKIPPED
{code}
      assigned =
          assignOffSwitchContainers(clusterResource, offSwitchResourceRequest,
              node, priority, reservedContainer, schedulingMode,
              currentResoureLimits);
      assigned.requestNodeType = requestType;

      return assigned;
    }

, Thanks for comments [~jianhe], attached ver.2 patch., Attached ver.3, added more comments and fixed findbugs warning., \\
