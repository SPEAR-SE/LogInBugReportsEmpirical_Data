[Fixes so that capacity can be < 1.  It allows you to actually set capacity == 0 since we don't support deleting queues.  It also fixes an issues with the webui where if capacity ==0 it was showing NaN, The changes look good to me.  My only concern with setting the capacity to 0 would be it could be possible to create a queue where a user would never be able to run anything, even if it is just to drain the queue of apps currently running.  Of course I suppose that is currently possible with a minimum of 1% on a small grid.  I am +1 on the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
