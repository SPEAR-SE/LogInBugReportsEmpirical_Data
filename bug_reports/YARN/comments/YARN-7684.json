    YARN-7684. Fix The Total Memory and VCores display in the yarn UI is â€¦

    The Total Memory and VCores display in the yarn UI is not correct with labeled node
    
    Use the cluster resource memory and Vcores info instead of the root queue metrics, availableMB + allocatedMB. and availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores.

, [~sunilg] I create a  pr for the fix. Could you help review the code? Thanks!

Also I saw this problem also happened on version > 2.7.3. Will I need to porting this fix into other upstreams? Thanks!, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Yes. Using cluster resource might be solving this temporary.
However we have partitions and hence cluster resource is not correct when we view total resource per label.

{{ this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB;}}
For root queue, ideally we should be able to sum up to parent root level. For label, I think we have not correctly calculating queue metrics. YARN-4484 has handled this case, however if its not working now, we need to see how it got broken., [~sunilg] 
Thanks for your update! You are correct, when we view total resource per label, the cluster resource is not correct.

And please ignore my comment about the issue happened on version > 2.7.3. This is my mistake to understand.  Sorry for the wrong comments!

 I noticed the [YARN-4484|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4484] fix target release is 2.8.0, we did not try the 2.8.0 release, we just found the problem on 2.7.1 and 2.7.3. So next we will try your fix on  2.8.0. Any results I will update here. Thanks!

I porting the YARN-4484 patch back to 2.7.3 and test the fix in my 2.7.3 cluster, The total mem and cpus are show correct. And after submit jobs, they are still show correct. But in my understand view total resource per label is not correct. I paste my test results [^TestResultsAfterPortingYARN-4484.pdf] in the attachment. Could you have a look? Thanks a lot!

, I will say that clicking on NodeLabels link on nodes count wont redirect to show per label resource. Its not designed in that way. We were planning to show total cluster resource.
And in Node Labels page, we can see per label whats the total resource on last column., [~sunilg] Thanks for clarify! If so, I will close this issue. Thanks again for you time!, Github user zhaoyim closed the pull request at:

, Thanks [~zhaoyim] I re-opened to close this as Wont fix. and you could provide 2.7 patch in YARN-4484 to include in next release., This is already covered in 2.8+ version. YARN-4484 could be backported to 2.7 as needed., [~sunilg]  Sorry for trouble you again! You said I can create a 2.7 patch include the YARN-4484 fix, but  I am not sure how to do it. Because in the HowToContribute doc I saw, it said "If you are unsure of the target branch then trunk is usually the best choice. Committers will usually merge the patch to downstream branches."  I guess the YARN-4484 fix already include in the trunk branch, so only the committers can merge the patch to 2.7 branch, right? Thanks!]
