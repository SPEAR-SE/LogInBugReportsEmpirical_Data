[This patch integrated the XFrame Options Filter from Hadoop Common.  Some notes:

- The filter is enabled by default.  It can be disabled via 'xframe-options-enabled' properties (properties have been created for all web interfaces in this integration)
- I've run checkstyle locally and there are no new style issues introduced by the code modified or added in this patch

, [~vvasudev] - the unit test failures above don't seem related to my changes.  Is there anyway to find out if they are known issues?, The resourcemanager test failures are known - it's due to an environment issue. The nodemanager and application history service test failures are new to me but are unrelated to this patch.

+1 for the latest patch - I'll commit it tomorrow if no one objects., Hi [~jmaron] and [~vvasudev], do we have very solid case to partially enable XFS protection (like enable RM, NM, but disable ATS)? 
If not, I would suggest to have a uniformed configuration "yarn.webapp.xfs-filter.xframe-options-enabled" and "yarn.webapp.xfs-filter.xframe-options" as we don't want too many redundant configurations in YARN/MAPREDUCE which is really a headache now., I think of a few cases around Ambari for example which may want to embed the RM UI but not the NM or ATS. In that case we want only the RM to have the XFS options set to SAMEORIGIN but the rest to DENY., I agree with a [~vvasudev] - there are certainly use cases in which the granular control of this filter would be required., Granular control on different XFS options sounds reasonable. However, back to my original question - do we need to partially enable XFS protection? If not, at least we can merge all "xframe-options-enabled" configurations. I want to call loudly for our attention on adding new configuration carefully: once unnecessary configurations are added, it would be very hard to remove.
In addition, mark XFS protection enabled with DENY option by default is a kind of behavior change - that could affect monitoring tools like Ambari. Shall we disable it by default?
, I'm fine with changing the default to SAMEORIGIN. I believe we need the granular control that Jon has implemented., bq.  I believe we need the granular control that Jon has implemented.
You mean granular enable/disable on different web app? Do we have solid case for now? If not, we can be more "granular" later. As I mentioned earlier, it always much easier to add some configurations than remove them., Like I mentioned above - embedding the RM/ATS ui in a frame but blocking the NM ui is a pretty reasonable scenario. Adding a YARN level config which can then be overridden by a RM level config down the line will make things more confusing. It's the other way round that's the problem in my opinion - with one config parameter - you force the users to open all web ui's or no web ui's., bq. Like I mentioned above - embedding the RM/ATS ui in a frame but blocking the NM ui is a pretty reasonable scenario. 
Agree. I think we can achieve this by set RM/ATS's option to SAMEORIGIN but keep NM as DENY. Isn't it?

bq. Adding a YARN level config which can then be overridden by a RM level config down the line will make things more confusing.
There is no overridden here. A YARN level configuration is just to enable/disable XFS protection feature. The sub options to address different daemons' requirement if XFS protection is enabled. Do I miss any cases here?

bq. It's the other way round that's the problem in my opinion - with one config parameter - you force the users to open all web ui's or no web ui's.
Not really. The one config parameter here is just to mark YARN web ui are open or restricted (in different levels/options). Is there really a case we want some YARN web ui pure open to frame when other is protected? Instead, adding configurable ALLOW-FROM make more sense to me., Ah I think I misunderstood what you were saying. If I understand you correctly, you want the following the configs -

# yarn.webapp.xfs-filter.enabled
# yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.xframe-options
# yarn.nodemanager.webapp.xframe-options
# yarn.timeline-service.webapp.xframe-options

Correct?, [~djp] - if you can confirm that the settings [~vvasudev] lists above are a reflection of the way you'd like to see the configuration I can make the change - I have no real strong objection.  I can look into making the default SAMEORIGIN., Yes. Varun's list above is exactly what I prefer. Please go ahead to update. Also, SAMEORIGIN as default make more sense also. Thanks!, [~vvasudev] - please review and see if this addresses the changes requested.  Thanks!, Thanks [~jmaron] for updating the patch.
In yarn-default.xml, we still put configuration "yarn.nodemanager.webapp.xfs-filter.xframe-options-enabled" and "yarn.timeline-service.webapp.xfs-filter.xframe-options-enabled" there. We should remove them.
Other looks fine to me., Thanks - missed that.  Will upload new patch., Thanks Jon. v4 patch get very closed. 
Just one issue: testDefaultBehavior() still test against DENY but we already change the default option to SAMEORIGIN. However, when I run the test, it can finish successfully. Do I miss anything here?, The test actually verified that a value set for the property is returned as a header, so the value isn't as important as the fact that the values are the same., Got it. If we don't set any CUSTOM_HEADER_PARAM, XFrameOptionsFilter will set default option as DENY.
+1 on latest patch pending on Jenkins' report., It looks like Mr. Jenkins is on strike for some reason. Kick off it manually., You kicked it off or do you want me to?  I have been unsuccessful in the past..., No worry. I already kicked it off: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/11553/

, The unit test failure is not related and we have other JIRA to track this. 
However, we need to fix the checkstyle issue, especially the "missing package-info.java file": I think it could be better to move the test class from ".../src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/webapp/" to ".../src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/webapp/" given we don't test other daemon's webapp., Will that address this problem?  I have no idea why this would be required simply to accommodate a test class., I think so - in this way, you have to also update the package name to "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.webapp;" after the movement. Or you have to add a package-info.java with specifying new package name in the previous directory. I am fine with both ways but prefer the previous way., Does a package-info.java file need to exist for org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.webapp?  I don't see one at the moment.

{noformat}
HW10386:hadoop jmaron$ find . -name package-info.java | grep resource
./hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/recovery/package-info.java
{noformat}, That's right. Just check again that it sounds like we were not adding package-info for all test classes' package. Ok. Let's keep it is right now., The other check-style issue is just a minor whitespace issue. Will fix it in commit.
+1 on 004 patch. Will commit it shortly., I have commit the patch to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~jmaron] for the patch and [~vvasudev] for review!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9826 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9826/])
