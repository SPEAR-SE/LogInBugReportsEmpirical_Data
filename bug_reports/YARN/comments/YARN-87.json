[Quick patch to fix the permissions of the cache directories when they are created.

I suspect this isn't the end of the story, as everywhere the NM grabs a FileSystem/FileContext it will have to ensure the umask is permissive enough to allow it to set permissions properly.  Simply grabbing a FileContext and specifying permissions of 0750 won't help if the config sets the umask of that FileContext to 0077., +1 overall.
