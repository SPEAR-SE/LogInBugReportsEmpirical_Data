[We have seen this issue as well. , I just read the code again. {{NodeStatusUpdaterImpl}} 's {{getLogAggregationReportsForApps}} actually calls {{lastestLogAggregationStatus.poll()}} and add it to another newly created list to be sent to RM. So this isn't an issue?, Thanks [~mingma]. I checked the code, it seems not an issue. I'll verify it again. 

[~kasha] Maybe the issue you met is not same? ]
