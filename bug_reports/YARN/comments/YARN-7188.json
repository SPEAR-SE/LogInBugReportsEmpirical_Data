[It fails because while creating a table it except file location to be present in hdfs location.

I remember it used to work in lower versions of hbase without failing table creation. May be some modifications from HBase causing this issue! cc:/ [~vrushalic] [~varun_saxena]
, Is it a problem?
We mention in the documentation that you have to place the jar in the said location.
And flow run coprocessor is required to retrieve values correctly from flow run table., The coprocessor jar was earlier picked up from the classpath since  it was a statically loaded coprocessor which was enabled for all tables. Hence we had special defensive checks in the coprocessor to ensure it works on flow run table only. Had the jar not been in the classpath, we would have likely had the same error during schema creation as well as during region server restart. 

As part of YARN-6094, we have updated the coprocessor to be a dynamically loaded, table level one. The documentation changes have also been made.
, thanks [~vrushalic] for pointing out about YARN-6094. I see in the doc section _Enable the coprocessor_ as well that clearly says about flow run co-processor able creation. Closing as Not a problem!
Apologies for missing this point earlier and spamming!!]
