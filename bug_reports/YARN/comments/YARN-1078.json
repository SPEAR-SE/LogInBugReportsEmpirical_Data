The patch seems regressing on Linux. I will investigate the failure., Cancelling patch while test failures on Linux are investigated., I looked into the failure. It turns out we use InetAddress.getCanonicalHostName() to construct nodeId in "ContainerManagerImpl". In the test, we assume this will always be "localhost" for a local loop back address, i.e. 127.0.0.1. However, this is not the case on Windows. As the method could return "127.0.0.1" on Windows instead of "localhost". In the old patch, I switch from "localhost" to "127.0.0.1", and regressed Linux. Attach a new patch that uses getCanonicalHostName() to obtain the name for nodeId constructed in the tests., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Chuan, the current patch applies cleanly to trunk, but not branch-2 or branch-2.1-beta.  Can you please investigate and provide a branch-2 patch?
