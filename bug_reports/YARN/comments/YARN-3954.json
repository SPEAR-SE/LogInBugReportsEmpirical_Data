[This test case has been broken by YARN-2003.
Its because there was a new config added in that JIRA {{yarn.cluster.max-application-priority}} which was not added in yarn-default.xml

But I think the main problem here is that YarnConfiguration.java is in hadoop-yarn-api and the test is in hadoop-yarn-common.
Either we should add this test class in hadoop-yarn-api or we shoud make sure that Jenkins runs this test in hadoop-yarn-common if YarnConfiguration.java is changed.
Otherwise we will keep on getting this test failure after commits.

Is there a reason tests are not there in hadoop-yarn-api ?
cc [~ajisakaa], [~sunilg]

, [~sunilg], have added description for config added in YARN-2003 in yarn-default.xml.
Can you have a look if description is fine ?, Thanks [~varun_saxena] for pointing out.
Yes. The description looks good for me. 

+1, I suggest that this test case can be moved to hadoop-yarn-api. So any changes in YarnConfiguration.java will automatically trigger this. Could we handle this also in this ticket.
, Even I think test should be moved to hadoop-yarn-api.
Will raise another JIRA for it if everyone agrees as that would include some pom changes as well. Currently there are no tests in hadoop-yarn-api, \\
