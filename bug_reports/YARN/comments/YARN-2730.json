This message is automatically generated., [~jlowe] Hi Jason, do you have some time to take a look at this patch?, Thanks for the patch, Siqi.

We could go two ways with this.  We should be able to solve it without modifying FileContext at all by having startLocalizer create a clone like this:

{code}
  FileContext localizerFc = FileContext.getFileContext(lfs.getDefaultFilesytem(), getConf());
  localizerFc.setUMask(lfs.getUMask());
{code}

Or we could add a cloning ability to FileContext directly, like this patch.  If we continue with that route then we need to clone everything in case the clone method is used elsewhere.  The workingDir is not copied, and thus it isn't a true clone.  One might want to clone a filecontext just to modify the umask, for example, and therefore callers would expect the working directory to be preserved during the clone.

TestFileContext: Configuration and StringUtils are unused imports.

Nit: some original lines that were formatted for 80 columns no longer are after the changes.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~jlowe] for your feedback, I have updated the patch using the first approached you mentioned above., Thanks for updating the patch, Siqi.  In the latest patch the startLocalizer method is still synchronized, so the original problem remains., Sorry about that, I have updated the patch with the synchronized keyword removed, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
