[Hi [~bibinchundatt]

Thanks for raising this. As I see this, there is a mismatch b/w RMAppAttempt state with {{YarnApplicationAttemptState}}. Below two states are not present in this {{LAUNCHED_UNMANAGED_SAVING, FINAL_SAVING}}.

, Sorry for the partial comment.
contd..

I think we need to consider only about {{FINAL_SAVING}} and for this we can make use of {{stateBeforeFinalSaving}}. {{createApplicationAttemptState}} has this check and manages this condition. I think this can be emulated in {{createApplicationAttemptReport}} too., Might want to add something in the javadocs of both classes that they need to be kept in sync, Hi [~bibinchundatt], I think YARN-4411 takes care of all the scenarios, just try that patch to verify if it solves this issue !, Attaching patch for review, Hi [~bibinchundatt]
YARN-4411 has similar fix, Could you please sync up in that ticket., [~sunilg]
Thnks . will sync with YARN-4411, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~bibinchundatt] for the patch, changes look good to me except these from test.

1. Here I think we don't need to catch the Exception and make the test fail, instead we can leave the Exception without try/catch and let the test fail with that.

{code:xml}
    } catch (Exception e) {
      Assert.fail("Exception not expected-->" + stateChecked);
    }
{code}
Exception

2. Can we remove this condition here and test for all the states without if check?

{code:xml}
+        if (rmAppAttemptState.equals(RMAppAttemptState.FINAL_SAVING)) {

{code}

3. I think there is some unnecessary code {+    allocateApplicationAttempt();} and duplication checking, you can remove these.
, Just one small thing to be noted, this issue is dupe of YARN-4411 and also that is being created first. I think let YARN-4411 goes in.
[~bibinchundatt] would you mind addressing all comments in YARN-4411?, I see as per the conversation in YARN-4411, they both agreed Bibin to provide a patch with test. Providing a patch with test in YARN-4411 or in this jjra would be ok for me., [~devaraj.k]
Thanks for the review comments .i have updated patch in YARN-4411

Should have been for all cases other than {{FINAL_SAVING}} since its requires previous other state handled separately

done, [~bibinchundatt], Thanks for the quick response and updated patch, I see you are uploading patch in the both jira's. Please close any one as duplicate and continue with the other jira. Thanks, Closing this issue as duplicate of YARN-4411]
