, Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.6. Thanks [~zjshen] for your pointing and [~djp] for your work! , Is there a reason for including this in 2.6.1? We only fix critical issues in point releases. Also, there has been no discussion of a 2.6.1 on the dev or private lists yet. , [~kasha], Thank you for pointing out. When we had voting for 2.6.0, HDFS-6833 was reported as a blocker of 2.6.1 release. But as you mentioned, this is a test fix and not critical issue. Should we revert against brach-2.6 and move the changes against CHANGELOG.txt to 2.7? , Yes. Reverting from 2.6 makes sense. Thanks Tsuyoshi , Done. Thanks, Karthik., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6770 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6770/])
