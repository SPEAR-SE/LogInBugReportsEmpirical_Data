[bq. In the NM log it is found that AM kills some of the containers
If it appears the AM is killing the containers, have you looked in the AM log to see why it is choosing to do so?

bq. if the container is getting killed , why is its log present in container logs?
Logs can be present for containers regardless of their exit status.  It is perfectly normal and expected that a container can have logs if the container was killed after it was launched., What job and how many containers are running?  If AM is killing the container with 143 exit code indicates containers are gracefully finished when the RM is the process of transitioning. Does all the the containers running on the NodeManager killed  or few killed?
, job running - pi
no of mappers - 10

in AM logs it's mentioned - Container killed on request]
