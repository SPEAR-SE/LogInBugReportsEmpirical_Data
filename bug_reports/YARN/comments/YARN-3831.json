[Hi [~hex108], thanks for reporting this issue, What version is your code? YARN-3491 fixed a race condition when a local disk turns from bad to good., [~zxu], thank you for the remind. Sorry for late reply.

The bug was found in version 2.2.0. I checked latest code. It seems have been fixed: there is a 'localDirsChangeListener' to handle 'onDirsChanged', when a local disk turns from bad to good,  'localDirsChangeListener' will try to initialize it.

Closing it now., [~hex108], thanks for the confirmation!]
