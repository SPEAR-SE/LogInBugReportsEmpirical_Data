[Looks like JDK 8 doesn't like that we're throwing {{T extends Throwable}} here, because we're not declaring {{throws Throwable}}.  The patch fixes this by wrapping the calls to {{instantiateException}} with methods that return more specific subclasses of {{Throwable}} that are declared to be thrown.  This allows us not to have to declare additional thrown types.  And I couldn't replace {{Throwable}} with something more specific ({{Exception}} would probably work, but doesn't really get us anything) because {{YarnException}}, {{IOException}}, and {{RuntimeException}} don't have a more specific common parent., I was successfully able to compile with JDK 7 and JDK 8., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I'd seen this too. Given that jenkins is happy with it, and you can replicate with the javac version updated:
