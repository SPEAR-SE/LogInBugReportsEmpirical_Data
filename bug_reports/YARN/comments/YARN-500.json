[Same is for Nodemanager webapp, ResourceManager & NodeManager webapp calls Builder<T> at(String bindAddress) method in o.a.h.yarn.webapp.WebApps.
This method always enables findPort(private variable).
If findPort enabled and configured port was already in use, webapp try to use next port.
So, I made a patch to disable findPort if configured port was not zero.
This spec is same as NameNode webapp., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

 - Can we also fix at(int port) method too to find-ports if the passed in port is zero?
 - Regarding the test, it won't work like that - two separate servers both started on ephemeral ports are not guaranteed by the OS to have successive ports. The correct way is to pass in zero and mock webapp/httpserver with a custom listener/connector to get exception on first try and get a success on the subsequent retry. See if you can do this, otherwise we can drop the first test., Fixed at(int port) to enable findPort in port is zero and dropped first test.
