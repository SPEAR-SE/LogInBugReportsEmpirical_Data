[This looks like a user issue instead of bug. I suggest you can send this message to yarn-dev instead of reporting as bug., I think this is a bug at the MiniYarnCluster implementation part. The app gets stuck for a MiniYarnCluster., Not sure if it was a MiniYarnCluster bug, but definitely TestRMContainerAllocator runs into a similar issue. , May be, something to do with the dispatcher? , I faced similar issue when I was taking on YARN-2921... Can I take a look at this issue?, Yes please.]
