[The patch changes the deleteCgroup() method to retry the delete in a loop (retrying every 20ms) until it succeeds or it times out (500ms). Also, this is done for all containers, not only for AM containers. It also introdcues a configuration knob for the timeout.

Other changes, such as method signatures and initConfig() method are to enable unittesting of the new logic., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., tested in a cluster using cgroups and works as expected, both the delete and the timeouts., A few nits.  Otherwise LGTM.

{code}
+  //package private for testing purposes
+  private long deleteCgroupTimeout;
+  Clock clock;
{code}
Comment should go before the second variable. Also there should be a space after the "//".

{code}
+  //visible for testing
{code}
Should the VisibleForTesting annotation be used? This is in two places.

{code}
+    LOG.debug("deleteCgroup: " + cgroupPath);
{code}
Should be surrounded by if (LOG.isDebugEnabled())

{code}
+    //file exists
{code}
Space after "//"?, Oh, and also:
{code{
+    if (! new File(cgroupPath).delete()) {
+      LOG.warn("Unable to delete cgroup at: " + cgroupPath +", tried to delete for " +
+      deleteCgroupTimeout + "ms");
     }
{code}
If the file was already deleted, delete() will return false and we'll log the warning even though nothing went wrong.  Instead, we should just check "if (!deleted)"., Addressing Sandy's comments. Reworked the while loop logic using a do-while block, seems a bit cleaner that way., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., For the record, I've spend a couple hours trying an alternate approach suggested by [~rvs] while chatting offline about this. His suggestion was to initialize a trash cgroup next to the containers cgroups and when a container is cleanup transition the <container>/tasks to the trash/tasks, doing  the equivalent of a {{cat <container>/tasks >> trash/tasks}}. Tried doing that but it seems some of the Java IO native calls make a system call which is not supported by the cgroups filesystem implementation and I was getting the following stack trace:

{code}
java.io.IOException: Argument list too long
java.io.IOException: Argument list too long
at java.io.FileOutputStream.writeBytes(Native Method)
at java.io.FileOutputStream.write(FileOutputStream.java:318)
at org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils.copyBytes(IOUtils.java:80)
...
{code}

Given this, beside that I didn't get it to work properly, I would not be comfortable doing this as this may behave different in different Linux versions., Updating patch with one last change (which it was not in my git cache), the default timeout is not 1000ms (up from 500ms). While testing this in a 4 nodes cluster running pi 500 500, there was one occurrence of a left container cgroup because of a timeout. This was done in a cluster running in VMs,  which it would explain the 500ms timeout, but still I'd rather bump it up given that the wait will break as soon as the cgroup is deleted and the attempts are every 20ms., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
