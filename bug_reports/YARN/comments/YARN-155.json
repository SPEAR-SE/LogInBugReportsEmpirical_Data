[The issue appears to be that the tests expect the initial app event type to be RMAppEventType.KILL and since with jdk7 the order of tests in random, the last test testRMAppSubmitError is sometimes being called before the others and it doesn't reset the type back to RMAppEventType.KILL.  I put in a @After routine to always reset it after each test., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
