This message is automatically generated., The test failure is not related to the patch - just timeout. We can fix it on another JIRA., With this patch the return code is wrong (0). Earlier it was returning a non-zero error code. Please also consider adding that check to the test, Thank you for pointing, [~raviprak]. I'll check it., Fixed exit code to return non-zero value(-1) when application doesn't exist., Thanks Tsuyoshi!

Patch lgtm. +1. I'll commit it tomorrow in trunk and branch-2 unless any one has a comment., Trying to get Hadoop QA to test this patch, Uploading the same file again hoping the pre-commit build will pick it up now., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
