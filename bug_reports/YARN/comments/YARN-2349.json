[This is basically configurations in capacity-scheduler.xml of both RM's does not match. During recovery application is moved  New->ACCEPTED synchronously by adding application to scheduler. Before scheduler knows about appilcation,RMAppImpl is moved to ACCEPTED. Any exception(for serveral reason) during submitApplication,APP_REJECTED event is triggered which inturn cause InvaliStateTransition.
For fixing it, either enfource both RM's configuration should be same adding note OR handle APP_REJECTED event at ACCEPTED state., Hi [~nishan], would you confirm that this issue you are still getting in 2.5 or trunk. I checked code and found that it is already been handled. , Closing the issue as 'cant reproduce'. Feel free to reopen if you find issue in latest release or trunk.]
