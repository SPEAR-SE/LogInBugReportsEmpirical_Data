[In non-HA settings, if users do not explicitly set the {{yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address}} in configuration, {{WebAppUtils#getResolvedRMWebAppURLWithoutScheme}} returns RM webapp address based on the value of {{yarn.resourcemanager.hostname}} via the default value set by yarn-default.xml.
{noformat}
  <property>
    <name>yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address</name>
    <value>${yarn.resourcemanager.hostname}:8088</value>
  </property>
{noformat}

As a result, WebAppUtils#getProxyHostsAndPortsForAmFilter can return proper proxy address.

This does not apply to {{yarn.resourcemanager.hostname._rm-id_}} in HA mode.
, Attached patch make WebAppUtils#getProxyHostsAndPortsForAmFilter to get RM webapp addresses from {{yarn.resourcemanager.hostname._rm-id_}} and default port number if {{yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.(https.)address._rm-id_}} are not set., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~iwasakims] Did you see this issue in a real cluster environment ? As far as I know, when we start RM, and we only set up yarn.resourcemanager.hostname.rm-id, we will set this for all the service address, including yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address.rm-id and yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.https.address.rm-id.

{code}
    // Set HA configuration should be done before login
    this.rmContext.setHAEnabled(HAUtil.isHAEnabled(this.conf));
    if (this.rmContext.isHAEnabled()) {
      HAUtil.verifyAndSetConfiguration(this.conf);
    }
{code}
, Thanks for the comment, [~xgong]. {{HAUtil.verifyAndSetConfiguration}} works only on the RM node. AMs running in slave nodes also need to know the RM webapp addresses., I updated the patch to use existing {{HAUtil#verifyAndSetRMHAIdsList}} instead of adding new logic., I fixed the patch again to call {{HAUtil#verifyAndSetRMHAIdsList}} only if any webapp addresses are got in order to keep assumption of {{TestAmFilterInitializer}}. It expects that incomplete configuration properties should be ignored., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. HAUtil.verifyAndSetConfiguration works only on the RM node. AMs running in slave nodes also need to know the RM webapp addresses.

Thanks for the explanation. That makes sense.

The patch looks good overall. One small nit:
in {code}
  public static List<String> getRMHAWebappAddresses(
      final YarnConfiguration conf) {
{code}
We could check whether RM_WEBAPP_ADDRESS has been set with RM-ids. If not, we only need to check whether RM_HOSTNAME has been set with RM-ids instead of calling {code}
HAUtil.verifyAndSetRMHAIdsList(conf);
{code} ?, bq. We could check whether RM_WEBAPP_ADDRESS has been set with RM-ids. If not, we only need to check whether RM_HOSTNAME has been set with RM-ids instead of calling

Yeah. I rethinked that using HAUtil#verifyAndSetRMHAIdsList which update conf is not safe. I attached 004.
