This message is automatically generated., [~iwasakims], thanks for working on this. maybe add a link in the side bar  to link to the  hadoop-yarn-site/index.html too ? The link can be located at the YARN section on the side bar and may call it overview. 
I think it's fine to keep a full list of document indexes in the main index too ?, Thanks for the comment [~jianhe]. I update the patch. I could not find the way to avoid duplication in site.xml and *.apt. I will fix it again sometime in the future if someone adding docs miss the one side., thank you ! will commit once jenkins reports, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
