This message is automatically generated., This patch contains modification for api only. I think no addtional test needed., +1, I also got this bug when doing YARN-2051, hope it will get committed soon.
, Thank you for taking this JIRA, [~kj-ki]. IMO, we should add test code to prevent this kind of bugs. How about adding tests under hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/records/TestResourceOption.java? [~djp], what do you think?, Looks like we already fixed it in YARN-2051. Mark this as resolved.]
