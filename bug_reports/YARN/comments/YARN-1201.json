[After changing setting in hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager,the test will pass.
The detail is :changing "hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip"  from false to true in hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/test/resources/core-site.xml., Working on this, assign task to myself., This NPE not related whether hostname with "-" or not. It will happen when local hostname cannot resolved, this is caused by the following code snippet
{code}
    final Configuration conf = rm.getConfig();
    final YarnRPC rpc = YarnRPC.create(conf);
    final InetSocketAddress serviceAddr = conf.getSocketAddr(
        YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_SCHEDULER_PORT);
{code}
Mock RM will set its address to YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS to its own config, and this test called 
{code}
conf.getSocketAddr(
        YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_SCHEDULER_PORT)
{code}
Resolve the service address from config again, if the local hostname cannot be resolved by coincidence, test will be failed.

P.S, you can verify if you cannot resolve your local hostname by executing,
{code}
ping `hostname`
{code}
And encountered the error
{code}
ping: cannot resolve YOUR_HOST_NAME: Unknown host
{code}
The NPE will be raised.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for identifying the root cause and delivering a patch here. However, I don't think we should fix test here as test code itself is fine to me. We'd better to throw an exception with meaningful message rather than NPE when local hostname cannot be resolved. So I move this from test to bug., That doesn't seem to make sense. When would localhost be not resolvable?, [~vinodkv], localhost cannot be resolved would be happened when it doesn't contain a proper domain name, the mechanism used by Java to resolve a host is similar to "nslookup <hostname>". Domain name not configured is a common case when user try Hadoop in local(vm).
As [~djp] suggested, I think we'd better throw a meaningful message rather than NPE when hostname cannot be resolved., Uploaded a new patch to make this test case throw proper exception instead of a simple NPE. This test cases hard coded checking "e.getCause().getMessage().contains(expectedMessage)". When other exception thrown, like "UnknownHostException", the e.getCause().getMessage is null. So updated type of exception cached from "Exception" to expected "AccessControlException"., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The patch looks good to me overall. However, I think we'd better to improve code below:
{code}
+     return expected.isInstance(e) || (
+         e != null && isCause(expected, e.getCause());
{code}
if e is null, then it depends the behavior of isInstance(objectB) in JDK (some old version JDK will return true for this case, please refer: https://bugs.openjdk.java.net/browse/JDK-4081023, which suggest user to handle null case before calling this method). Thus, I think a more clear way to do is:
{code}
+     return e != null && (expected.isInstance(e) || isCause(expected, e.getCause());
{code}
Also, it is better to add some comments on new added method., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Nice catch [~djp]! Thanks your comment,
I've uploaded new patch addressed your comments., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for addressing my comments above. A few typos need to be fixed here:
{code}
+   * this because sometimes, a exception will be wrapped to another exception
{code}
should be "an exception"
{code}
+   * So we cannot simply cache AccessControlException by using
{code}
should be "catch".
Will +1 when typo is fixed and Jenkins result get +1. , Thanks [~djp], fixed typos according to your suggestion, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
