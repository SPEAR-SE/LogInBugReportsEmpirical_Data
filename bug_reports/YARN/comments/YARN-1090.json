[upload a patch that renames 'Active Apps' to 'Schedulable Apps' and 'Pending Apps' to 'Non-Schedulable' Apps in CapacitySchedulerPage as the definition of Active Apps is actually 'Schedulable' and the definition of Pending Apps here is 'Non-Schedulable' due to queue and per user limit.
Also add two more metrics specifically for 'Running Apps' and 'Pending Apps' for both queue and user on the scheduler UI., My understanding was that an application is "Pending" if no AM has yet been allocated to it.  Can you go a little more into what the issue is with this definition?

Also, whatever we decide, is there somewhere where we can document exactly what these mean?, bq. My understanding was that an application is "Pending" if no AM has yet been allocated to it
Yes, that's correct. What I meant here is about the UI of the Application Queues usage inside which:
'Num Pending Applications' doesn't mean that no AM has been allocated it, and propose to rename it to 'Num non-schedulable applications'., Ah, ok, makes total sense, YARN-1090 contains a fix of YARN-1132., Upload a new patch, reorganized the scheduler UI page, @[~jianhe] - Suggestion: can you please provide a simpler patch which only tweaks the UI for now? We can rename variables etc. later... thanks!, Uploaded a patch that only renames 
Num Pending Apps  -> Num Non-schedulable apps
Num Active Apps -> Num Schedulable apps

Also added a missed entry for Absolute Used Capacity in the UI.
Fixed a minor comment in QueueMetrics, upload a new patch that added missed renames, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
