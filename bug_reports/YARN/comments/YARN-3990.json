Was able to reproduce the same. Attaching logs, thanks [~bibinchundatt] for reproducing the issue. I believe in you clustesr appsCompleted/appsRunning are 20000 and max number of completed apps to keep is set to 20k? , [~rohithsharma] Attaching patch for initial review, [~rohithsharma] 
Yes,Currently i have submitted about 50K+ apps and {{yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}} is set to 20K. {{yarn.resourcemanager.state-store.max-completed-applications}} default ={{yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}}, \\

This message was automatically generated., Nice catch, Rohith!

+1 lgtm.  Will commit later today to give others a chance to comment.
, Yes, that is a good catch!
{{rmContext.getRMApps()}} stores both completed and running APPs, Current default value for max-completed-applications is 10000, we may save up-to 10000 NodeUpdateEvent.
+1 too.
, Change looks good. It would be good to have a unit test to catch regressions., Hi [~adhoot] . Was tricky. Attaching patch including testcase.

This message was automatically generated., Please look into the java and release audit warnings.

The new TestNMUpdateEvent file probably should just be named TestNodesListManager so we can add more tests specific to the NodesListManager there.

Rather than using mock RM and NM objects and running some RMApps it seems like we could have just isolated the NodesListManager more directly.  We can hand it a mocked RMContext that returns a pre-baked list of apps that are alive and apps that are finished and then verify when we send a node usable/unusable event that the appropriate update events are sent to the appropriate apps by registering our own event handler with something like a drain or inline dispatcher.  Not a must fix, just wondering if that approach was considered., [~jlowe]
Thank you for your comments
