[Put a patch to remove this logic. The change should be mostly compatible. 2.6 server can still read the data created by 2.5, but take the owner as the normal primary filter. 2.5 server can also read the 2.6 data. The only drawback is that no owner info is available for entity-level acl control. However, as I've mentioned in description, the owner info will be incomplete. So anyway, there's a bug., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Makes sense given
 - We now do all authz based on domains
 - User filter was always a hidden filter anyways
