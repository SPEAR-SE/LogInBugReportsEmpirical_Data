[Svetozar, I think this is expected because AMRMToken today is used in both secure and non-secure environment., Yes, this is by design.  Yarn uses tokens regardless of your security setting., Hm, I would expect a warning message in my logs if is like you said. That's because my configuration settings are completely ignored., A warning doesn't make sense because it implies there is something you should change.  There's not.  The config setting, whether explicitly set or not, is entirely irrelevant.  By design, yarn always uses tokens and these tokens carry essential information that is not otherwise obtainable for non-token authenticated connections.  That's why token authentication is explicitly set.]
