[[~sjlee0] mentioned that "NM's initialization is taking a LONG time because of this (this one's been doing this for 1 hour 41 minutes, and not all done), but monit isn't restarting it. To me, the ill effect is that the NM startup is taking a long time (and probably will get longer each time), and the directories are not getting cleaned up.", {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., @siqi, it would be good to elaborate on the nature of the bug a little more?
, When NM starts up, it moves usercache to usercache_DEL_<timestamp>, and it tries delete everything inside usercache_DEL_<timestamp>, and then it will delete usercache_DEL_<timestamp>.

However, when there is nothing in usercache when NM starts up, the usercache_DEL_<timestamp> will not be delete properly.

The reason is that FileContext.listStatus(userDirPath) will not return null if userDirPath is a valid empty directory. That's why empty usercache_DEL_<timestamp> directories are not cleaned up properly.

Especially, when DN/NM is flapping, a large number of empty usercache_DEL_<timestamp> directories will be generated, which will take a certain amount of space and slow down NM start up process, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~l201514]. Just wanted to add that when this happens and if the NM has enough of these empty directories it would take a long time for the NM to finish the init, and the RM gives up on it and sends a shutdown to the NM. This cycle repeats., [~l201514], the patch looks good. It might be good to add a small unit test to demonstrate the bug/fix., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~jlowe] can you take a look at this?, Thanks for the patch, Siqi.

userDirStatus can be null if userDirPath is not a directory, so we should avoid the potential NPE and check for {{userDirStatus != null && userDirStatus.hasNext()}}
