[Further analysis found the some claims made in the original description are no longer valid for apache version. The issue #2 and #3 are in our cluster specific -- not an apache issue.

However, the issue #1 remains valid.

In short, the scope of this JIRA becomes very limited than what I originally thought.
Will put a simple patch soon.
