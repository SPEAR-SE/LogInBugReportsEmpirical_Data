This message is automatically generated., Nice catch [~tianyin]. Thanks for your contribution.

The patch looks good to me except these comments.

- can you change the log level to INFO and log message similar to the one in NodeHealthScriptRunner.serviceStart().
{code}
LOG.info("Not starting node health monitor");
{code}

- and also can you remove the shouldRun() redundant check in NodeHealthScriptRunner.serviceStart().
, It is fixed as part of YARN-3375, closing as duplicate.]
