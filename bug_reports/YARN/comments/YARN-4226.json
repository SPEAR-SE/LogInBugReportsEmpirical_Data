[Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., Since the {{preemptionDisabled}} tag has already shipped with the capacity scheduler's REST API, I don't think that changing the name of the tag is an option, since users may be relying on that key string. I see only the following options:
# Change the value of {{true}} to {{disabled}} and {{false}} to {{enabled}} (which may not be an option either for the same reason changing the key is not an option)
# Add a new key like {{preemptionStatus}} and have the values be {{enabled}} or {{disabled}}
# Make no changes. Leave it the way that it is, Since the code works and is only slightly confusing, I am closing this ticket as WontFix.]
