[This problem can happen due to the following reasons:
 # If user is not authorized in hadoop-policy.xml, it will prevent SPNEGO token to be sent from client to server side.
 # Hard code zookeeper.sasl.client.username=zookeeper in YARN_OPTS in yarn-env.sh.  User is unable to read zookeeper znodes to find active resource manager.

Both problems are configuration mistakes, and they are not bugs in the current YARN code.  Therefore, close this as working as designed.]
