[Reverting of YARN-656 should be fine I think.., that will fix it for the capacity scheduler, we need to see if that breaks the FairScheduler though.

, I'm thinking changing how to calculate total memory when the scheduler is CapacityScheduler is straightforward.
{code}
  if (rs instanceof CapacityScheduler) {
    this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB + reservedMB;
  } else {
    this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB;
  }
{code}
Hi [~tgraves] and [~brahmareddy], what do you think?, Rethinking this, it's better to change how to calculate availableMB in CapacityScheduler. availableMB should include reservedMB for consistency., [~ajisakaa] thanks for taking a look into this issue.. It's better consisent between all the schdulers..Attached the patch..Kindly review.., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~brahmareddy] for taking this issue. The patch seems to revert YARN-656. I'm thinking that's not fine because it will break FairScheduler. This issue should fix CapacityScheduler only., Kindly review the attached patch!!!, I think we need to think about the vcore too.
In current code, it is:
    this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB;
    this.totalVirtualCores = availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores;


Do we need to make    this.totalVirtualCores = availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores+containersReserved;, Sorry, should be
 this.totalVirtualCores = availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores+reservedVirtualCores, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~brahmareddy] for the comment and updating the patch.
bq. I feel bettter to include in TotalMB/Containers as reservedMB/Container
Do you mean you want to add "total containers" metric in ClusterMetrics? It should be discussed in a separate jira.

I'm thinking "Total MB = Available MB + Allocated MB + Reserved MB" seems fine, so I'd like to change how to calculate the metrics in FairScheduler. However, it is an incompatible change.
Therefore, I'm okay with your (compatible) approach, but you need to fix the following:
{code}
+    if (rs instanceof CapacityScheduler) {
+      this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB + reservedMB;
+      this.totalVirtualCores = availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores
+          + containersReserved;
{code}
{{containersReserved}} should be {{reservedVirtualCores}}.
In addition, I'm thinking it's better to add a regression test to verify that totalMB and totalVirtualCores are unchanged when a resource is reserved in both CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler., Recently ran into this issue again. Just seems wrong that totalMB fluctuates significantly due to reservedMB moving around. Since we can't reserve beyond the size of the cluster, it seems fine to have Total MB = Available MB + Allocated MB + Reserved MB for the capacity scheduler. 

I guess this could be an incompatible change to anyone who's worked around the problem by adding reservedMB to totalMB. [~vinodkv], [~kasha@cloudera.com], others have comments on this aspect?

, The last patch here seems reasonable. [~yufeigu] has offered to confirm the same. , The last patch seems good to me generally. I wonder if we can add unit tests for these since the different logics between FS and CS and these logic might change sometimes., [~brahmareddy], are you still working on this? I would be happy to pick up where the latest patch left off and add a unit test so that we can get this committed. , Oh sorry, missed this..didn't get time to work.. will try to update the unit testcase on next week., Thanks [~brahmareddy] for the patch and folks for reviewing. During the bugbash we discussed and decide it was ok to commit as is. If you can add testcase later on would be good as well. Committed to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.8, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10711 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10711/])
YARN-3432.  Cluster metrics have wrong Total Memory when there is (carlo curino: rev 892a8348fceb42069ea9877251c413fe33415e16)
* (edit) hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/webapp/dao/ClusterMetricsInfo.java
, Hi [~curino], this patch applies cleanly to branch-2.7, can we commit there as well? Thanks!, [~curino] thanks for commit..and thanks to all for additional review.

[~jhung] Pushed to branch-2.7.

In the following code, {{containersReserved}} should be {{reservedVirtualCores}},Even Akira mentioned same.
{code}
+    if (rs instanceof CapacityScheduler) {
+      this.totalMB = availableMB + allocatedMB + reservedMB;
+      this.totalVirtualCores = availableVirtualCores + allocatedVirtualCores
+          + containersReserved;
{code}

As I am planing to raise separate issue for testcase(little tricky,as there are no way to get total metrics),I will handle as part of that.

As testcase for this can be can be done only through webService..So I feel, Firstly we need to parameterize {{TestRMWebServices.java}} ,then we can add.]
