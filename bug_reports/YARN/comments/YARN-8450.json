During kill scenarios/preemption cases this issue mainly gets exposed.
Thoughts on moving the resource check to {{ResourceHandlerChain}}.

Solution could be wait until the resource is released by {{resourceHandlers}} which has strict binding.
or Adding {{canAssign}} interface to resource handlers, and Query canAssign till timeout. Thoughts?]
