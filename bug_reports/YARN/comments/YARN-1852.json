{noformat}, This seems most likely due to , we are replaying the attempt's BaseFinalTransition logic which causes sending a new FAILED/KILLED event, while RMApp already moves to FAILED/KILLED state.  We covered the case for FINISHED state but it seems we miss this., +1 Jian, 

Attaching patch for handling KILLED/FAILED applications during recovery. I added ignoring an event for failed->failed and killed->killed states.

I verified manually checked and verified for no InvalidTransitionException after running  test case., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~rohithsharma], just walked through the code again. We should not send the ATTEMPT_FAILED/ATTEMPT_KILLED events, if the app was supposed to recover to the final state. We should send the events only if the app was not able to recover it self. I think the following "RMAppImpl.isAppInFinalState" has some problem, it's checking against the move-to state, while by the time this method is called, the app has not yet moved to this state. We may check against RMApp.recoveredFinalState state instead?
{code}
// We will replay the final attempt only if last attempt is in final
        // state but application is not in final state.
        if (rmApp.getCurrentAppAttempt() == appAttempt
            && !RMAppImpl.isAppInFinalState(rmApp)
{code}, bq. We may check against RMApp.recoveredFinalState state instead?
Done

Test is written for checking FINISHED/KILLED/FAILED applications. The fix I verified in single node cluster.

Attached updated patch as per comment. Please review., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
