[I believe this doesn't happen at all since there is a check upfront, but I'll double-check to make sure., This won't happen because after AM sending resource requests to RM (via ApplicationMasterProtocol) in allocate(AllocateRequest request), the RM will do sanity check against it which include checking memory > 0.
Related code pieces:
In ApplicationMasterService.java,
{code}
        RMServerUtils.validateResourceRequests(ask,
            rScheduler.getMaximumResourceCapability());
{code}

In RMServerUtils.java,
{code}
 public static void validateResourceRequest(ResourceRequest resReq,
      Resource maximumResource) throws InvalidResourceRequestException {
    if (resReq.getCapability().getMemory() < 0 ||
        resReq.getCapability().getMemory() > maximumResource.getMemory()) {
      throw new InvalidResourceRequestException("Invalid resource request"
          + ", requested memory < 0"
          + ", or requested memory > max configured"
          + ", requestedMemory=" + resReq.getCapability().getMemory()
          + ", maxMemory=" + maximumResource.getMemory());
    }
...
{code}
Will resolve this JIRA as not a problem.]
