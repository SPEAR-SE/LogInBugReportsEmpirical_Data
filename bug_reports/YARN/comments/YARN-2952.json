[we may change {{loadedVersion = Version.newInstance(1, 0);}} to {{getCurrentVersion()}}, +1 for issue, always base major version is considered as 1. But in real use cases, base major version can be greater than 2 or 3 which installation itself will fail. , This problematic code has be propagated to multiple places where leveldb is used, which need to be fixed together., Where ever LeveDB is used, it has been already taken care for getting current version info. These won't cause any issues. Still I guarded in the upper layer but RMStateStore has real issue., Kindly review the attached patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
