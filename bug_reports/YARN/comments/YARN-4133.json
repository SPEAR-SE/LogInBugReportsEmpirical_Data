[Hi [~zxu], it seems the current preemption logic has many problems. I just updated one in [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4120?focusedCommentId=14735952&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14735952]. I think a logic refactor is need, what do you think?, Of course we can also address these problems one by one in different jiras. If you like this, just kindly ignore the above comment., \\
