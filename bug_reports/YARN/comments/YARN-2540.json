[Note : this problem happens when we want to filter by any queue, not just root.default., Attached patch fixes this issue. The problem was that in FairScheduler, queue names are represented as fully qualified name(root.blah.blah) while the filtering logic in FairSchedulerPage.java filters based on a substring of the queue name., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Didn't add unit tests since it was a cosmetic UI change.
I verified the patch manually by running apps in multiple queues in 2-level queue hierarchy and
checked if clicking on parent/leaf queues resulted in right filter set., Veried the patch. Running an app in queue "root.wei.yan", and the patch works well., There is a case in which the filter can return wrong results :
Say apps running on root.a.b and root.a.b1
Clicking on root.a.b would return apps running in both b and b1, instead of only b.

v2 patch corrects this., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
