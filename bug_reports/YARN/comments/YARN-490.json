[With this patch, the test passes on Mac and Windows.

In {{Client}}, we need to switch to using platform-specific environment variable syntax and path separator.  In {{TestDistributedShell}}, we need to shorten the test working directory by using {{Class#getSimpleName}}, similar to what we've done in some earlier patches.  We also need to launch "dir" instead of "ls" on Windows.

Also, these tests won't pass successfully on Windows unless the patch on YARN-488 is applied too., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I also verified that eclipse:eclipse builds on both platforms., +1. Will commit shortly. , Thanks Chris. Committed to trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3502 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3502/])
