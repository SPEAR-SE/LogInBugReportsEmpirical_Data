[[~srimanth.gunturi] The tracker url is served by the application. There is no guarantee that it will handle the accept headers correctly and return the data in the correct format. In this case, assuming you are talking about tracker url for a mapreduce job i.e. from the MR AM, it may be possible to enhance MR to handle accept headers in a better manner. However, the YARN proxy just does a redirect to the AM and therefore will not be able to do anything. 

Please go ahead and move this jira to MAPREDUCE if required or please add other concerns that you have regd. the proxy.

, [~hitesh], My original goal was to get MR2 specific information via API. I went down the proxy path reading [http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/MapredAppMasterRest.html]. How do I determine the host:port documented there? Also, once the application has completed, there is no AM to serve the API?

If there is any API, JMX way of getting MR specific information documented in YARN-989, please let me know., The AM is only up while the job is running. Once the job is completed, the tracker url redirects to the job history server. 

What you probably want to do is look at the status of the application from the initial /cluster/apps call to understand whether you are being redirected to the AM or HistoryServer. Then again, there are likely to be race conditions when the job is about to complete. 

For job history, I believe this link should help: http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/HistoryServerRest.html

It is an interesting issue that the url structure is different for AM vs HistoryServer when it comes to accessing the rest interfaces. Maybe, that is the issue to be solved for a layer accessing job information via the webservice layer to work seamlessly.


, Information provided via YARN-1001 would be sufficient for the intent of this issue.]
