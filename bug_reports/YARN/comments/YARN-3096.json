[The user interface still shows 100% because the wrong property is being set, so the queue is not using a 25% user limit.  This can also be verified by examining the RM logs after it starts up or the queues are refreshed.

In queue properties the queue name needs to be the full path including "root", so the property should be yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.default.miminum-user-limit-percent.  See the [CapacityScheduler documentation|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.6.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/CapacityScheduler.html] for more details., That's weird, that was set by Ambari, maybe this is an Ambari issue since I literally just changed the number. I should have spotted this but it's been a few months since I was tuning Capacity Scheduler queues... doh.

I will raise this as an issue with Ambari's default in this case., Raised AMBARI-9331]
