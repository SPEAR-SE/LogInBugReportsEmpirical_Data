This message is automatically generated., Can you please provide more detail.  Having it on by default makes it easy for someone to have it set incorrectly since clusters have varying size.  I think the idea of setting it to the number of racks was to balance the time you delay vs getting exact locality.  Do you have any data on the reason for changing it?, Yeah sure.

There are two intents to change this value 

1. Make it enable by default
2. The algorithm which we use to check for the applications to get the scheduling opportunity is based on heart beat from the NM , hence if we just use the number of racks it will not be much of the value add for actually to achieve the node locality. The intent of using the number of delay is to actually at least wait for one heart beat from each node in the cluster and then move task to next locality level.

I defaulted it to number of nodes in one rack generally.

Thanks,
Mayank
, Looks good to me! Thanks Mayank.

I'll re-kick hudson to be sure..., Re-kicking hudson., Agree with the general sentiment. I've seen repeatedly how the default of -1 is really bad with many users.

Kicking Jenkins for real. Will commit it once I get back the blessings., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
