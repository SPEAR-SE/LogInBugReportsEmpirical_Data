[Could you provide more details about "duplicating the conversion code" ? [~zjshen] Thanks. :-), Do you reffering to this?

{code}, I've validated it the problem again. RMServerUtils#createApplicationState is already removed from trunk since YARN-540. Branch YARN-321 brings it back. We may have some problem when merging branch-2 into YARN-321. Close it as invalid now, and if we need to fix the duplicate code when merging YARN-321 back to branch-2, let's reopen it. Anyway, thanks for your effort, [~haosdent@gmail.com]!]
