, Thanks for working on the patch [~wilfreds], In most of the cases  procfsDir i.e. *"/proc/"*  will not be empty unless wrong folder is configured using the constructor, which is a rare case (and not as per the existing flow). But no harm in having this fixed as per the patch, hence i am ok in getting this committed. But i feel we can merge 6513  also in this itself to avoid cross failures in the jenkins result ?, Hi [~wilfreds] and [~Naganarasimha]

Note there is an umbrella jira HADOOP-14336 to fix all findbugs warnings since switched to spotbugs, there is a jira to fix all warnings for YARN HADOOP-14338, this one seems a duplicate... does that make sense to track all fixes under the umbrella?, [~cheersyang], As mentioned in YARN-6515, i would prefer per project YARN findbugs fix...,  [~wilfreds], 
[~cheersyang] was already working on findbugs for yarn under umbrella jira  HADOOP-14336 , just yesterday we concluded that he split yarn jira into project specific jira's and hence he created YARN-6517 - YARN-6520 and split his existing patch and uploaded. So as WeiWei yang had started first i thought of making this jira duplicate of YARN-6517. thoughts?, I am happy to make this a duplicate of YARN-6517. I'll comment on the changes in that jira., Thanks for the support [~wilfreds] ! closing this as duplicate issue.]
