This message is automatically generated., Couple of comments.
 - Should AdminSecurityInfo move yarn-common ?
 - RMAdminProtocolPB.java sets the protocol name to  "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.api.RMAdminProtocolPB". The nodemanager part doesn't make a lot of sense. This exists in the current code as well - so this could be fixed in a separate jira. In fact all Yarn protocols are named *PB (ClientRMProtocolPB, RMAdminProtocolPB, etc). The PB bit isn't required., Tx for the review Sid.

Updated patch moving AdminSecurityInfo.

Also needed to fix bin/yarn :)
