[Hi, [~asuresh]. Any feedback on this? 
Maybe you could assign this to me?, Hello [~He Tianyi], Sure.. Ill assign this to you.. I can help with the reviews etc.

BTW. now that YARN-3116 is resolved, you can figure out which is the AM container.. and should make things a bit simpler, [~He Tianyi], for some reason, JIRA is not able to find you in the Assignee list. Can you please assign it to yourself ?, Hi [~asuresh]. I think I am unable to assign it to myself too, there is no more 'Assign to me' link. , [~kasha@cloudera.com], can you do something about this ?, Is it necessary that we make this 'preempting containers other than AMs' thing optional?
I investigated preemption related codes in {{CapacityScheduler}} and there is no option to control this behavior. , FYI.. I added [~He Tianyi] to contributors list. Welcome [~He Tianyi]!]
