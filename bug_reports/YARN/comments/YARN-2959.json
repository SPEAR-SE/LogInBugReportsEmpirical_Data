[Thanks for reporting this, Ashwin. A couple of follow-up questions:
# Is preemption enabled? I would have expected Job B to have containers preempted and handed over to Job A.
# If Job A was submitted before Job B, we should probably investigate why Job B's AM came up first? Are these MR jobs (or managed AMs)? If they are managed AMs and the order of requests was not honored, considering the AppAttempt start/register time might not help us much. ]
