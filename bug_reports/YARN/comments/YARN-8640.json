[Submitted patch.  There were two other functions in container-executor.c with the same problem, so I fixed them as well.

, Tested by running test-container-executor and cetest - both pass with no errors.  Also ran sleep and pi jobs on a single node cluster with and without docker, and also with NM restart during the jobs.

[~jlowe] please review.

 , Thanks for the patch!  +1 lgtm.  Committing this., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #14766 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/14766/])
YARN-8640. Restore previous state in container-executor after failure. (jlowe: rev d1d129aa9deecebf42261947fcb0b2ca46dacad5)
* (edit) hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/native/container-executor/impl/container-executor.c
, Thanks, [~Jim_Brennan]!  I committed this to trunk, branch-3.1, branch-3.0, branch-2, and branch-2.9., Reopening so I can provide patches for branch-2.7 and branch-2.8., Submitting patches for branch-2.7 and branch-2.8.

[~jlowe] Note: the patch for branch-2.7 includes a fix for test-container-executor - it was failing on the /bin/ls check for me, which was fixed in YARN-4594, but that fix is not in branch-2.7.  Let me know if I should remove the test-container-executor.c change from the patch., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Bummer, the 2.8 docker build appears to be busted.  In the meantime I took a look at the 2.8 patch and had one concern.  It looks like we are now leaving write_exit_code_file_as_nm as root instead of as the yarn user which was done previously.  It would be safer to leave as the yarn user as was done originally.

bq. Let me know if I should remove the test-container-executor.c change from the patch.

It's a small change and fixes the unit test, so I'm OK with that staying in the 2.7 version., [~jlowe], thanks for the review!  I have removed the changes to write_exit_code_file() in both patches.
