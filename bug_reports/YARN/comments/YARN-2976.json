[[~hitesh], I can take this on. Would your preference be for fixing the documentation or extending the current behavior? I would think it makes more sense to have a flexible configuration., The latter definitely makes more sense but it does not clash with the config property name. Maybe, we can deprecate the old one in favor  of the newer config property which supports a flexible command ( relative path, args, etc)? For the old/cuurent one, we can fix the docs to say that it does a file exists check and does not support additional args? , Typo: meant to say that it *does" clash with the current config property name. , [~hitesh], yes that makes sense. I can call the new config property yarn.nodemanager.docker-container-executor.exec-cmd. I would think that this setting should take precedence over yarn.nodemanager.docker-container-executor.exec-name in case both are present, what do you think?, Agreed. The newer one would take precedence.]
