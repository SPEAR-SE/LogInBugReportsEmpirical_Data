[TestContainerManager.testContainerLaunchAndStop runs successfully but running its subclass is a bit tricky. [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com], could you advise what is the proper way of running TestContainerManagerWithLCE?, You can build with native profile and run the test specifying the path to the container-executor:
{code}
mvn package -Pdist -Pnative -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
mvn test -Dyarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.path=./hadoop-yarn-project/target/hadoop-yarn-project-3.0.0-alpha3-SNAPSHOT/bin/container-executor -Dtest=TestContainerManagerWithLCE
{code}
