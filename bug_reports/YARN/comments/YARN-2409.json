[[~nishan],

Is the application timeline service (ATS) running when you see these exceptions? I have seen this happening when ATS is running, but not when it is turned off. It appears there may be an incompatibility between ATS and the State Store subsystem in the RM., I looked into issue (got logs from [~nishan] offline), there is problem in transitioning to standby. While resetting the dispatcher, new dispatcher has been created and assigned to existing dispatcher. But it is missed to stop current dispatcher which causes *1 Thread Leak i.e "AsyncDispatcher event handler" on each standby transition.*

InvalidStateTransitonException are due to processing of queued events from rmDispatcher. This is very corner scenario which would occure because of ActiveStandByElector call back and internal RM transitin to standby(I reproduce it)
Consider, RM1 has Active state. 
If RM transition to standby because of STATE_STORE_FENCED, it first *a) transition RM to standby* and *b) notify elector.*
At the same time, before notifying elector if elector ask RM to change Active(bcs of zk  unstable and gets rm lock first) then the following flow will occur
1. rm.transitionToStandby(true);  --- > From RMFatalEventDispatcher.handle()
2. AdminService.transitionToActive(); ---> From Elector
3. rm.adminService.resetLeaderElection(); ---> From RMFatalEventDispatcher.handle()

From above flow problem occure is , say App1-->AppAttempt1 is launched and running. AppAttempt1 has put its status update events to rmDispatcher queue.
Say STATUS_UPDATE ---> STATE_STORE_FENCED.
a) Above mentioned 3 flows ocured while processing STATE_STORE_FENCED. It means, RM has transitined to ACTIVE-->STANDBY-->ACTIVE recovering running application AppAttempt1.
b) Since rmDispather thread is not stopped while transitioning to Standby, it process STATUS_UPDATE(rmContext has already app recovered, so it will not be null) event which causes InvalidStateTransitonException., Attached the patch. Please review..

I have verified patch for
1. Thread Leak : Switching manually many times using admin command.
2. Queued up events are not processed once RM moves to StandBy., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Updated issue description as per defect. InvalidStateTransition ocure because of not stopping rmDispatcher which process events after RM is transitioned to Standby, [~rohithsharma], thanks for the analysis and detailed description.

+1 (non-binding), [~rohithsharma], thanks for your explanation.   looks good to me., Committed to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Rohith ! 
And thanks Eric for reviewing the patch !, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6088 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6088/])
