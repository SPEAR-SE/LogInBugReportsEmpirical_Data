[A quick fix possible is to suppress this exception and then try not to allocate any resource here in this Node.
RM can continue functioning normally.
If we can just suppress this exception while resolving Ip to get container token, it will not affect in NODE_UPDATE call.

      Token containerToken = null;
      try {
        containerToken = createContainerToken(application, container);
      } catch (Throwable t) {
        // Handle any internal exception and continue normal...
        return Resources.none();
      }


But on a second thought, could a valid node check (w.r.t resolve node Ip) in ResourceTrackerService is a good idea or not?
Then can try shutdown this NM.

Pls share your thoughts., This appears to be a duplicate of YARN-713., Yes it is.]
