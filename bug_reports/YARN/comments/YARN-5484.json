[I think just like other place on yarn where process AccessControlException to YarnException , here we can warp AccessControlException to YarnException :
{code}
 try {
      ....
    } catch (AccessControlException e) {
      throw new YarnException(e);
    }
{code}
Any ideas?, Dupe of YARN-4833?, Looks like it to me., Yes it is. I think a patch is already available there. We can push that in. I will help to review the same., Yes guys its duplicate and we were discussing the solution and planned to post the same]
