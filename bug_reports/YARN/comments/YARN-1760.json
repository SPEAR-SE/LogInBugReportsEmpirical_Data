[Trivial patch - the test explicitly sets the scheduler to CS., A couple nits:
* The same configuration is used for all the tests.  If the goal is to only use the capacity scheduler for a couple tests, then it should be instantiated in setup()
{code}
+    configuration.set(YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER,
+        "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.CapacityScheduler");
{code}
It looks like this goes over 80 characters.  Also, probably better to use CapacityScheduler.class.getName()., Thanks Sandy. Here is an updated patch. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks. One more thing: Configuration.addDefaultResource is a static method that applies to all configurations.  So it should either go in setup or the non-static configuration.addResource should be used. , Wait, from what I understand, Xuan will have a similar FairScheduler test via YARN-1679. That test explicitly was for CapacityScheduler, we will very likely rename it at YARN-1679., If you agree, then we can close this as invalid.., The goal here is just to make the use of the Capacity Scheduler in the existing tests explicit, so that they will pass on distros that set other schedulers as default., I have seen other JIRAs like this and I think I understand the goal. But I don't see this JIRA adding any value once YARN-1679 adds a fair-scheduler specific test in the same class., I assume that YARN-1679 will have "conf.setClass(YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_CLASS, FairScheduler.class)" in the FS-specific tests that it adds.  This JIRA adds the same to the CS-specific tests.  In some other JIRAs, I've tried to make it so that certain tests pass independent of whether the Fair or Capacity scheduler is used. But the goal with this patch is just to make the dependency of the existing tests on the Capacity Scheduler explicit so that it will override a non-CS default., hm.. okay., Compared using the static version in a static block and using the non-static version. The non-static version seems marginally faster. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
