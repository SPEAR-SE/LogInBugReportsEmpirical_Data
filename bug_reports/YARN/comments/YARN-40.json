This message is automatically generated., Thanks Devaraj for this addition! +1, can you please add docs for these new commands (e.g. in YarnCommands.apt.vm)., I agree with Ahmed that we need better documentation on these commands.  I would also like to see the tests updated so that instead of using mocks to verify how many times printf was called on stderr, I would prefer to see us compare the actual output to a string.

I also would prefer to see us use commons CLI for the argument parsing like we do in other parts of the code, but this is very minor.  I don't see it as a problem with the current code, I just have seen too many commands expand beyond what they initially had, and the command line parsing become very ugly., Thanks a lot Robert and Ahmed for reviewing the patch.

I have updated the patch with the above changes.

These javadoc errors are not because of this patch changes. Same errors were reported in other patches Hadoop QA reports also., Thanks for taking this up Devaraj.

None of these tools should be in the resourcemanager module. We should have them in some kind of client module.

I also see that we are duplicating (some) code for talking to RM via client API. In this light also, a yarn-client module will be useful so that clients of all frameworks can use/extend it. And that same module can be the destination for the command line tools.

Will open a separate ticket for the above., Devaraj, can you rebase the patch and modify it to use YarnClient now that YARN-29 is in? Tx., Thanks Vinod for looking into the patch. I will update the patch., I updated the patch to make use of YarnClient. Please review it., Great, looking at the patch right now.., Thanks, this looks a lot cleaner. Some comments:
 - Call "app" command as "application" everywhere?
 - Rename YarnCLI.STATUS ans YarnCLI.STATUS_CMD. Similarly others.
 - The speical handling of completed apps in killApplication() is not useful. Between the time a report is obtain from the RM and the subsequent kill request, an app can go to a final state. We should handle this as part of forceKillApplication() in RM itself. Can you open a separate ticket for that?
 - I think we should start making the lists simpler than what they were in MR1, which were unnecessarily bulky. We should only print basic information in the list command, and if somebody needs more information than that for an app/node, they can use "application -status" or "node -status". How about:
  -- For application
    --- Application-Id
    --- Application-Name
    --- User
    --- Queue
    --- State
    --- Final-State
    --- Tracking-URL
  -- For node
    --- Node-Id
    --- Node-state
    --- Node-http-address
    --- Health-Status
    --- Running-containers
 - Please remove all spaces in a single header. Like "Application-Id" instead of "Application Id"
 - Finally, we should format the columns and their headers properly - See org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.tools.CLI 's headerPattern and dataPattern for example., Thanks a lot Vinod for the comments. I have updated the patch.

I have raised YARN-107 for handling this.
, This has a bug in "node -status" in case there are multiple nodes. Fixing this myself.., This should fix the bug. Will commit it once Jenkins blesses the patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Do we have plan to backport this to branch-1?, Junping,

Do you mean an equivalent for the "yarn node" command for MRv1 tasktrackers? I guess it could be done if there is value in it (personally I've not seen people interested in monitoring a single TT's state of maps/reduces via the CLI). Other than that, the commands seem to be YARN specific?, Hi Harsh, there is requirement to dynamic configure resource/slot for hadoop nodes for YARN or MRV1 in a mix workload environment (like mix HBase and MR). So that admin can dynamically set the slot number to change QoS of MR as requirement. I have filed JIRAs (YARN-291, MAPREDUCE-4900) to track this, so list TT status (at least slot number) is still useful? Anyway, I saw Binglin create MAPREDUCE-4944 to backport this jira., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #518 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/518/])
