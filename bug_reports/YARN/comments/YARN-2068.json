[I think this is not the case.  The code is slightly confusing, because FairScheduler.java has a ResourceCalculator that it uses only for preemption.  This is going to go away with YARN-596.  The scheduling policies don't make use of this ResourceCalculator - the DominantResourceFairnessPolicy for example doesn't use a ResourceCalculator at all because it needs to save some intermediate results., Closing this as invalid.  Obviously feel free to reopen if I'm missing something.]
