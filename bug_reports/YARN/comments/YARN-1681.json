    if (strcmp(*banned_user, user) == 0) {
      free(user_info);
      if (banned_users != (char**)DEFAULT_BANNED_USERS) {
        free_values(banned_users);
      }
      fprintf(LOGFILE, "Requested user %s is banned\n", user);

This message is automatically generated., Nice catch, [~wzc1989]! Patch looks good to me. However, would you like to add a unit test in test-container-executor.c to cover this case?, Assigning to  Zhichun Wu. Canceling for the test-case., [~wzc1989], thanks for the work ! mind checking the above comments? , Moving all tickets targeted for the already closed release 2.6.0 into 2.6.1/2.7.2., Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, [~wzc1989], would you be able to pick this up again and add the test case? It'd be good to get this in for 2.6.2. Thanks!, Any progress on this? FYI, we will cut the first RC for 2.6.2 next week., [~sjlee0], I haven't work on this for quite a long time. I think I can do a quick change this weekend. Would try uploading new patch with test case. Sorry for the late reply., This bug is fixed in YARN-2847 with the same approach:)]
