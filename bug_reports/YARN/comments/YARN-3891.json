[In these cases, MR should preempt reducers and spawn mappers. A bug in headroom calculation (YARN-3485) leads to this MR issue. Could this be the same issue? MAPREDUCE-6302 is related. , Yes, I think this is related to  MAPREDUCE-6302. So if headroom calculation never return 0, MR will never preempt reducers for mappers?, Yep. YARN-3485 fixes the issue that leads to headroom never returning 0. By the way, I haven't had the chance to add the necessary tests and wrap up MAPREDUCE-6302. I ll be happy to review if anyone wants to take that up. ]
