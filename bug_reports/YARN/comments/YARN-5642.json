[good finds! interested in coming up with a patch for fixing these? [Our contributor guide|http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute] covers everything needed to work across the code base, but I'd imagine for these things a simple manual test of compilation before and after the changes should suffice., Interesting research Mehran! Thanks for your contribution. In addition to typos, does your research also discover grammatical errors?, It's currently not in our toolset since we find logs from source code that may not have the complete sentence. But we will try to detect grammar issues later., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
