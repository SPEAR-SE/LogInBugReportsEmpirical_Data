[Note that this addresses some situations with filesystems and the localizer, where it's reporting FS timing differences even when the files are unchanged. Checking purely on timestamp , while simple, is a pretty brittle form of validation.

BTW, looking at the code of getFileChecksum in HDFS, it can throw {{UnsupportedFileSystemException}} if a symlink points to an FS without the feature, whereas the API says "return null". YARN code had better check for both when building requests; when localizing, skip checks if checksum == 0 ]
