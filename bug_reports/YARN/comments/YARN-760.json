[Yes. Avro exception is also possible to be thrown out in NM reboot logic. I think simply change to YarnRuntimeException should be fine., Wrapped the exception with YarnException, Sorry,for the earlier comment it is RuntimeException and not YarnException and also removed AvroRuntimeException import , +1.

This message is automatically generated., Niranjan, Thanks for the patch. The test in TestNodeStatusUpdater include checking for exception message. Would you update a bit on this unit test so that your patch can pass all checking in jenkins? Thanks!, Is changing the unit test the right fix, or should we not be changing the message of the exception when we re-throw?, I still want the error messages for logging one for starting and one for rebooting. 
I ran the test on local and it passed the test as I removed the error message as suggested by @Jason Lowe. Thanks @Jason Lowe.,  Thanks @Jumping Du for the suggestion , I've made the changes,Can you please kick off Jenkins., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
