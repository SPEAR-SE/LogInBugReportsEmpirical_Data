[Docker only prevents --hostname and --net=host flag to be combined in older version of docker (1.13) . See [Docker issue|https://github.com/moby/moby/pull/29144].  The following table illustrate the possible combination when we should and should not support customized hostname:

| YARN Registry DNS | YARN Service | Custom AM | Network Type | Custom Hostname |
| Enabled | Yes | No | Host | Yes |
| Enabled | No | Yes | Host | No |
| Disabled | No | Yes | Host | No |
| Disabled | No | Yes | Bridge | N/A |

Today registryDNS and YARN service are coupled together, only YARN service knows how to populate hostname information to registryDNS.  If custom AM creates it's own logic to generate custom hostname, it must have some way to populate RegistryDNS to translate correct name.  Without using YARN service, there is no programmable API to customize hostname.  This is the reason that Spark on YARN cluster on docker mode fails with buzzard hostname composition.

For resolving spark issue, it is entirely possible to run spark using YARN service API without making any code changes to spark standalone mode.  To fix this issue properly, it would be best to provide hint to docker runtime to decide if custom hostname can be supported.  Custom hostname is a new concept that doesn't exist prior to docker container.  Therefore, only new application using YARN service should be supported in my view., Perhaps we should always set the hostname when the AM has provided one through the YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_CONTAINER_HOSTNAME env var, but place conditions on when the DockerLinuxContainerRuntime makes up a default hostname to set. We could remove the default hostname entirely, or just set it when net != host.

Another probably ill-advised option would be to have the runtime populate the registry when the runtime sets a default hostname and RegistryDNS is enabled. But then we'd have to figure out a way to clean up the registry later., Further analysis of the problem indicated that the registry DNS is set to mycluster.com, while the host level domain is example.com.  If the hostname is host1.example.com, spark on yarn cluster workload will start the container as host1.mycluster.com.  Host1.mycluster.com is unresolvable because no registryDNS entry is written to zookeeper.  Without using YARN service API, there is no AM logic that handles registration of hostname to IP mapping.  This is the reason that it failed.  For handling net=host situation properly without using YARN service API, the registry DNS must set to same as host level domain, which is example.com.  System administrator must configure registryDNS domain properly to permit application to use host level domain.  This is to ensure that decouple of infrastructure cluster (YARN), and workload cluster (YARN apps).  The application does not try to impersonate infrastructure cluster unless explicitly allowed.  This is a feature, not a bug., Reopen by accident during docker meeting.  Close again., Looking back over the history here, I think we made the wrong decision in setting the YARN defined hostname when {{\-\-net=host}}. I think we should make {{\-\-net=host}} return the NM hostname, even if Registry DNS is enabled, as you originally proposed in YARN-7797 via your early patches, [~eyang]. While using the YARN defined hostname was nice for testing, it breaks several aspects of running both Services and "native" Hadoop frameworks, such as MR and Spark, side by side, which is a core goal of the containerization effort. 

The problem isn't domain, it is that the "ctr" hostname we are setting won't exist in DNS for these containers. Concretely, the NM will set {{\-\-hostname=ctr-e111-11111111111-111111-01-000006.domain.site}} even though that entry will never be available via DNS, since the Spark job is not running as a YARN Service, and not writing any entries to ZK. Anything related to that container that relies on DNS lookups will fail., i think we're conflating two problems, 1) whether we should allow hostname to be set when net=host and 2) whether the docker runtime should set a default hostname for the container if the AM does not set one. The source of the issue is that the runtime is setting a default hostname and it is not populating the registry with that hostname to enable DNS lookups.

If we remove the default hostname, then we are delegating the behavior to the AM. The AM can set a hostname or not, and if the app needs DNS for a special hostname, the AM will have to populate the registry itself. This will preserve the current working behavior for the service AM and fix the behavior for other AMs that do not set a hostname., I guess a remaining question is whether we want the runtime to set a default hostname when net != host. When net != host, the container would have a random hostname anyway, so perhaps it wouldn't be a problem to have the runtime continue setting a containerID-based hostname., [~billie.rinaldi] When net != host, AM must set the hostnames for containers.  Randomly generated hostname will not work across nodes., Attached patch which sets hostname if specified via env or if the network is not host. This should work for all cases -m R, Spark and Yarn Service AM which sets custom hostname .

, Thanks for the patch, [~suma.shivaprasad]! I think we should also remove the unused code that was setting a default hostname: [https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/cb21eaa026d80a2c9836030d959c0dd7f87c4d6b/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/nodemanager/containermanager/linux/runtime/DockerLinuxContainerRuntime.java#L556-L565|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/cb21eaa026d80a2c9836030d959c0dd7f87c4d6b/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/nodemanager/containermanager/linux/runtime/DockerLinuxContainerRuntime.java#L556-L565,] and we'll no longer need the RegistryPathUtils import. Based on line 556, it looks like we should avoid setting the hostname when the provided value is empty, as well., Thanks for reviewing the patch [~billie.rinaldi] I think the logic to set default hostname is still required in case of non "host" networks when hostname is not set via YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_CONTAINER_HOSTNAME to avoid docker setting random hostname.   

Have added the empty check and refactored the setHostname code since it was confusing and moved everything into the method for better readability. 




, Ah, of course, I lost track of that condition. I don't see any issues with patch 2. Let's wait a bit to see if anyone else disagrees with this approach., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~suma.shivaprasad] Thanks for working on this.  I am still not clear on whether there exists any case in which we should be setting hostname when net=host?    As coded, if the YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_CONTAINER_HOSTNAME environment variable is set we will use it for hostname even if net=host.   Is this comment in DockerLinuxContainerRuntime.java still accurate?

{noformat}
 *     YARN_CONTAINER_RUNTIME_DOCKER_CONTAINER_HOSTNAME} sets the
 *     hostname to be used by the Docker container. If not specified, a
 *     hostname will be derived from the container ID.  This variable is
 *     ignored if the network is 'host' and Registry DNS is not enabled.
{noformat}, Hey [~Jim_Brennan], thanks for taking a look. You're right, that javadoc should be updated. Regarding the case where net=host and the hostname is set by the AM, this works successfully for the service AM because it creates registry entries for this hostname. This is why I suggested changing the net=host behavior only for AMs that do not set the hostname. The issues we have encountered in this ticket and YARN-8027 regarding net=host have been about the default hostname based on the contaner ID that is created in the docker runtime when the AM has not provided a hostname. The issues should be resolved by not setting the default hostname when net=host, as in patch 2., Thanks [~Jim_Brennan] [~billie.rinaldi] Have updated the patch with the javadoc fixed., [~suma.shivaprasad] thanks for updating.  Patch 3 looks good to me.
