[I am closing the ticket as invalid because you should be able to use

{noformat}
yarn rmadmin -refreshNodes
hdfs dfsadmin -refreshNodes
{noformat}

to tell the different processes to update their include/exclude lists.  If I misunderstood what the goal is of this ticket feel free to reopen it and explain better the difference between these., He probably meant adding a new file for include/exclude at runtime (cause it was possibly forgotten before by the operator). I think thats a moderate request and if our current refresh-able methods allow for such a thing, we can grant it (though it does seem dangerous if one were to configure badly (bad perm, etc.) and cause NN to throw up? Tests needed!)., Oh I see that now, thanks Harsh for that explanation.  My bad.  , Np Robert! Was a little confusing indeed.

@xieguiming - Are you willing to contribute a patch against trunk for this feature/improvement? We'd be happy to review it., OK, I will provide the patch., updateFileNames function already exists in the HostsFileReader. and HDFS has called this function. So, we only need to call updateFileNames in MR. 
and I provide two testcases.

There are few of my observations about the patch.

* Changes have done in mapreduce code, can we move this jira to mapreduce project. As description says it is for NN also, raise a new jira for hdfs.

* I don't think it will work, because if we want to get the updated values for 'yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.include-path' and 'yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.exclude-path', need to reload the configuration.

* There are some chinese characters have come in the patch, can we avoid them., 1, NN had been implemented by other before.

2, I have provide 2 new  testcasese.
   and modify 2 testcase already.

This message is automatically generated., Cleaned up Xie's patch. Doesn't depend on YarnConfiguration in the refreshNodes signature, formatted the test-cases and removed unwanted checks., Ping - Can someone take a look at this? Compatible change that helps admins, with tests attached to demonstrate it, making it akin to the NN today., +1. lgtm. Will commit after jenkins gets back., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
