[Does this need to be a blocker for 2.1.0 or will this require deprecation handling post 2.1.0?, Straight-forward patch that fixes the config names., This is config-incompatible change. Would be nice to fix it in 2.1.0, [~hitesh], I would ideally like this fixed in 2.1.0, but don't think it needs to be a blocker as 2.1.0 is still a beta release and this is not an API change., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Config changes ARE API changes. If you wish to rename it now itself, mark it as blocker and let the release manager now. Otherwise, you should deprecate this config and add a new one and wait for the next release. I'm okay either ways., Reuploading patch to kick Jenkins., Looks fine, I'll commit after jenkins. Thanks [~kkambatl]., Hi [~kkambatl], do you think it's also necessary to change 'yarn.resourcemanager.fs.rm-state-store.uri' to 'yarn.resourcemanager.fs.state-store.uri' for consistency with 'zk.state-store' ?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
