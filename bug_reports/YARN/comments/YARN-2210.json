[This is because core-site.xml is added in the resource manager as an input stream returned by ConfigurationProvider. When Configuration.addResource() is invoked on the input stream, the base system id is null and eventually the xml parser defaults to the current working directory, which may not be the actual location of the file.

The only workaround is to specify the full path as the href value which is highly undesirable and makes the documents non-portable., Resolving as a dup of YARN-1741, as that has more discussion around how this was broken and potential fixes., I had resolved it.
The following is part of  my core-site.xml:

<configuration xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude">
        <xi:include href="./mountTable.xml" >
                <xi:fallback></xi:fallback>
        </xi:include>
        <property>
                <name>fs.defaultFS</name>
                <value>viewfs://hadoop-cluster-xxx/</value>
                <!-- <value>hdfs://h2m1:9000</value>-->
        </property>
</configuration>]
