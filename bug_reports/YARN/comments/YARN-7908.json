[The line that corresponds with that NPE is:
{code:java}
    Assert.assertEquals(container.getAllocatedResource().getMemorySize(),
        // KeyValueBasedTimelineStore could cast long to integer, need make sure
        // variables for compare have same type.
        ((Integer) entity.getOtherInfo().get(
            ContainerMetricsConstants.ALLOCATED_MEMORY_ENTITY_INFO))
            .longValue());
{code}

Looks like the result of the {{get}} was null and the code blindly tried to dereference it.

I think there may be issues with the state store persisting across multiple tests.  Many tests use the same container ID, and I think there could be a race where the test polls for a container finished event not realizing this event is a stale one from a previous test.]
