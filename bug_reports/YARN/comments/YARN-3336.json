[I upload a patch for this issue. 
The fix is to call FileSystem.get(getConfig()) outside of the proxyUser.doAs.
So FileSystem.get(getConfig()) is at the current RM user context, it will return a FileSystem from the FileSystem.CACHE instead of creating a new FileSystem.
Since the patch is straightforward and a very small change, I think we don't need a test case for this patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~zxu].  Nice catch.

I think the current version of the patch would change the owner of all obtained delegation tokens from the application submitter to the user running the ResourceManager daemon (i.e. the "yarn" user).  Instead, can we simply call {{close}} on the {{FileSystem}} after {{addDelegationTokens}}?  Closing a {{FileSystem}} also has the effect of removing it from the cache.  Since we already know that a new instance is getting created every time through this code path, I don't think closing the instance can impact any other threads., Hi [~cnauroth], Yes, you are right, I forget the FileSystem RPC Proxy also need correct ugi information.
I uploaded a new patch YARN-3336.001.patch which addressed your comment. Please review it.
many thanks for the review.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~cnauroth], I implemented a unit test in the new patch YARN-3336.002.patch.
Without the fix, you can see the test failure with the following message:
{code}
java.lang.AssertionError: expected:<1> but was:<4>
	at org.junit.Assert.fail(Assert.java:88)
	at org.junit.Assert.failNotEquals(Assert.java:743)

	at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.security.TestDelegationTokenRenewer.testFSLeakInObtainSystemTokensForUser(TestDelegationTokenRenewer.java:1041)
{code}
I called obtainSystemTokensForUser three times, without the fix, the FileSystem Cache Size will increase to 4 from 1.
The unit test proved this memory leak issue.

, Hello, [~zxu].  Thank you for providing the new patch and adding the test.

I think we can avoid the changes in {{FileSystem}} by adding an instance counter to {{MyFS}}.  We can increment it in the constructor and decrement it in {{close}}.  Then, the test can get the value of the counter before making the calls to {{obtainSystemTokensForUser}} and assert that the counter has the same value after those calls., Oh, that is a good idea. I uploaded a new patch YARN-3336.004.patch, which use the instance counter for the verification. Please review it.
