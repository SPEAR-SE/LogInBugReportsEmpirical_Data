[It looks like the state store became out-of-sync with the local filesystem state.  Can you look back in the NM logs to see when /opt/hdfsdata/HA/nmlocal/usercache/root/filecache/39 was originally created?  Was the state store re-created or the disk declared bad/full in-between the creation of that directory and the error?  Seems like something would have had to go wrong with either storing the state or deleting the cache entry on the local disk for this to occur., [~ranga swamy], can you attach the logs ?, Sorry meant for [~singar.ranga], [~jlowe] Thanks for looking into this issue..

I looked into the logs, it was created three days back.And NM was restarted today (days doent matter anyway,just for reference).And disk is not bad and not full.

AFAIK statestore recreated after starting ..Hence old state store is out of sync or problem with deleting the cache entries, bq. AFAIK statestore recreated after starting

So if the state store was recreated on startup and the build has YARN-2624 fixed, any evidence why the local directories were not removed?  Even if there was a deletion error on shutdown, the whole local dirs should have been cleaned up on startup if the state store had to be initialized from scratch., [~jlowe] Sorry for late reply...After look into logs,,Came to know that  *disk declared bad ( since it's reached 90%) and nodes became unhealthy*

On restart of NM, those disk turn to good..

2015-06-19 04:47:18,765 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.LocalDirsHandlerService: Disk(s) turned good: 1/1 local-dirs are good: /opt/hdfsdata/HA/nmlocal; 1/1 log-dirs are good: /opt/hdfsdata/HA/nmlog..

, Ah, I think that might be the clue as to what went wrong.  If the NM recreated the state store on startup then ResourceLocalizationService will try to cleanup the localized resources to prevent them from getting out of sync with the state store.  Unfortunately the code does this:
{code}
  private void cleanUpLocalDirs(FileContext lfs, DeletionService del) {
    for (String localDir : dirsHandler.getLocalDirs()) {
      cleanUpLocalDir(lfs, del, localDir);
    }
{code}

It should be calling dirsHandler.getLocalDirsForCleanup, since getLocalDirs will not include any disks that are full.  Since the disk was too full, it probably wasn't in the list of local dirs and therefore we avoided cleaning up the localized resources on the disk.  Later when the disk became good it tried to use it, but at that point the state store and localized resources on that disk are out of sync and new localizations can collide with old ones., [~jlowe] Attached the patch to address to cleanup full dir's also..And thanks for your pointer's..Checked manually,deletion is happening for full dir's.., \\
