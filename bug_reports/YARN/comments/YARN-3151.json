[{{finalTrackingUrl}} is stored to statestore only when there is UNREGISTERED event from AM. Rest all the events {{finalTrackingUrl}} stored as null. But during recovery,finalTrackingUrl is assigned to originalTrackingUrl which is used for creating application report that makes tracking-url to null.Basically finalTrackingUrl should be updated for other events also by setting setTrackingUrlToRMAppPage., Attached the patch to fix the problem.

Any reason why we need to change the test code ?, bq. Any reason why we need to change the test code ?
This is because on CONTAINER_FINISHED event diagnosis message get updated i.e proxiedTrackingUrl at final_saving state. And later at failed state, proxiedTrackingUrl is assigned with RM Home page.  In test , diagnosis message is verified with keyword {{proxy}}. After patch, proxiedTrackingUrl is updated with RMHome page at final_saving state. So, test is changed accordingly. I believe, it was a bug previously which was pointing to url which can not be open., +1 LGTM. Will commit it., Committed into trunk/branch-2.
