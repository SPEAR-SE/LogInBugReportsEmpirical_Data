This message was automatically generated., Hi [~jianhe], I just rebased the patch, and checkstyle, whitespace and findbugs seem to be irrelevant.
, Thanks for the patch, [~l201514].  First, a lot has changed in the last year, so the patch no longer applies.  Care to update it?

Looking at the patch as is, it doesn't seem like you've addressed the stated issue.  You said the problem is that the available MB metrics is occasionally spiking to the total cluster resources.  This patch adds a new metric but doesn't change the available MB metric., Canceling patch until it's updated]
