Fix should be to allow for the CONTAINER_DONE_TRANSITION processing to occur from the INITTING state. This should remove the container from the list of containers the application is tracking so that it finishes cleaning up when the application actually finishes. As it stands the application is going to think this container is still running and will continue renewing log aggregation releases for ever. 
, Fixed timing issue in TestLogAggregationService, +1, looks good overall.  Minor nit in ContainerImpl.java that it could use EnumSet to combine all the events being ignored in the DONE state into one addTransition call., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
