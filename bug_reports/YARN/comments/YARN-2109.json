[This is interesting and I will work on it., Hi [~adhoot]
I did not see testNMTokenSentForNormalContainer() initializes the QueueMetrics that can be used in following tests. Could you point it out?
For the fix, I propose we unify the testNMTokenSentForNormalContainer() that can be used for any scheduler since TestRM is testing ResourceManager and ResourceManager  should support different kinds of schedulers (from the design point of view). , Hi [~airbots] did you get a fix working for this? I am not sure the issue is with testNMTokenSentForNormalContainer.  I have a simple mitigation that seems to work in my testing. Let me know if you mind if take this over and fix via the mitigation., Done, Submitting mitigation that clears the metrics so each test can no longer be impacted by previous test., Submitting the patch, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
