[YARN-679 tries to be a single entry point for anything that implements Service/subclasses AbstractService & adds extra support for an interface to take command line arguments.

It does double-exit escalation: first control-C triggers System.exit() and a shutdown with the hooks running; a second SIGINT triggers escalation and a hard System.halt. This addresses the issue that when IPC clients block in the retry/attempt cycle, they can deadlock on the shutdown code, Linking YARN-5487, where I hit the exact same issue., Yep, YARN-679 has an interrupt escalation mechanism, where the first CTRL-C is handled normally, but the second forces a halt., That's going to be an interesting interaction with the shell scripts which send a sigterm followed by a sigkill.]
