bq. +    nodeManager.stop();
* in AM, can you rename nodemanager to something like nmClient? It was confusing when I saw nodemanager.stop() :).
{code}
+    @Override
+    public void onContainerStarted(ContainerId containerId,
+        Map<String, ByteBuffer> allServiceResponse) {
+      LOG.info("Succeeded to start Container " + containerId);
+      Container container = containers.get(containerId);
+      if (container != null) {
+        nodeManager.getContainerStatus(containerId, container.getNodeId(),
+            container.getContainerToken());
+      }
+    }
{code}
* why do we need to do getContainerStatus after successfully starting it? is it required?

* also can you change LOG.info in CallBackHandler to LOG.debug / LOG.error as appropriate?

everything else looks good.. , bq. why do we need to do getContainerStatus after successfully starting it? is it required?

it's not required for functioning of the distributed shell. However, since distributed shell somehow servers as a demo application, I'd like to have getContainerStatus there to show the usage of NMClientAsync and its callback handlers., Thanks, Omkar! Updated the patch., Jenkins test seemed to be killed. Resubmit the same patch and kick out the test again., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
