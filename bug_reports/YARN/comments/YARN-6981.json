[Thanks [~daemon] Could you please give a bit more details.  Whats the change in cluster after "bin/yarn rmadmin -refreshNodesResources" command, and what was it before. Screen shots or more steps will help here., Thanks [~sunilg], we can reproduce the problem by following these steps:
* We could create a node label and name it *AAA*. We can see the resources corresponding to NM and *Total Resource* shown by the node label page.

* Create the *dynamic-resources.xml* file under the *etc/hadoop* directory and the contents of the file are as follows:
{code:java}
<configuration>
<property>
  <name>yarn.resource.dynamic.nodes</name>
  <value>bigdata-hdp-testser54.xg01.diditaxi.com:8041</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>yarn.resource.dynamic.bigdata-hdp-testser54.xg01.diditaxi.com:8041.memory</name>
  <value>51200</value>
</property>
<property>
  <name>yarn.resource.dynamic.bigdata-hdp-testser54.xg01.diditaxi.com:8041.vcores</name>
  <value>50</value>
</property>
</configuration>
{code}
* Use *bin/yarn rmadmin -refreshNodesResources* command to update node resources in RM.
You would found that the command works, and the resources of the node displayed in *RM Node Page* are as follows:

But the *Total Resource* displayed in RM Node Label Page is not changed.
, Thanks for sharing updating. It looks like an issue. {{refreshNodesResources}} doesnt handle cluster resource update. I will check and update here.]
