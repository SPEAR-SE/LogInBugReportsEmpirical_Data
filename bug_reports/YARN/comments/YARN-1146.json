[Note that bug #2 will not self-correct if the following sequence occurs:
# Issue token 1, 2, 3, 4 (seq=4)
# Renew token 2 (seq=2)
# Cancel token 3, 4 (seq=2)
# Stop RM
# Start RM (seq=2) and will issue token 3 and 4 again

The issue is _probably_ benign given the current implementation, but is a bug if anything relies on sequence number., [~vinodkv] I'm desynch'ing the ADTSM on HADOOP-9930.  Is it ok for me to exasperate this seq number handling?]
