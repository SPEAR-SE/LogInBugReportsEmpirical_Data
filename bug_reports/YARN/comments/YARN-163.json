[Patch to skip bytes instead of characters.  Still needs a unit test, but I manually tested it on a job with lots of multibyte characters in its logs and it fixes the issue., I wish there were some tests for the patch, but I can see how that is difficult for this, because there were no tests to begin with.  My only comment for this is that now that we are skipping using a InputStream instead of a Reader, could you also switch the code to use IOUtils.skipFully?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
