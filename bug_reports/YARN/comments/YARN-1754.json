[It looks like it only happens on mac, but works normally in linux, This is expected as OSX does not contain a {{setsid}} binary. If you make sure a binary available, you should see containers freed on OSX.

Also see: YARN-76, Get https://github.com/jerrykuch/ersatz-setsid and make sure that setsid is on your standard PATH., May be if setsid is not available, we can try traversing the process-tree and kill those processes. It is still fraught with race conditions but useful nonetheless.

IAC, this is a known issue, closing as duplicate of YARN-76.]
