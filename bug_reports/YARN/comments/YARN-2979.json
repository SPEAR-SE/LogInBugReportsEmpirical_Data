[The reason for this issue is same as the one in YARN-2978 i.e. QueueInfo object not being thread safe. So fix will also be same as YARN-2978.
Will close this once YARN-2978 is committed, Resolving this as well as YARN-2978 is committed, I think current issue status need to be changed as duplicate of YANR-2978 instead of Fixed because since there is no patch or committed id corresponding to this Issue in the git history log or change.txt file., bq. I think current issue status need to be changed as duplicate

Agreed.  Reopening to resolve as a duplicate of YARN-2978., Closing old tickets that are already part of a release.]
