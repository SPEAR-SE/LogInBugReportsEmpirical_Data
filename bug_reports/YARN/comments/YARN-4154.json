[In branch-2, YARN-2890 (d21ef79) was reverted and another patch (55b794e) was committed later. We should cherry-pick 55b794e instead of d21ef79 to branch-2.6.1., Seems to be done by 9c4a6e1 and dba2b6. Thanks Vinod!, Tx [~ajisakaa], not sure how I missed it earlier, I was careful about these reverts.

Anyways, the new commit applies cleanly.

Ran compilation and TestJobHistoryEventHandler, TestMRTimelineEventHandling, TestDistributedShell, TestMiniYarnCluster before the push.

Closing this correctly as a duplicate.]
