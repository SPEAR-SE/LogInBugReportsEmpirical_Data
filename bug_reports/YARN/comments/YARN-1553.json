This message is automatically generated., The v6 patch ensures that the AM always starts an HTTP server. Thanks [~vinodkv] for hunting the bug., 
Thanks for the patch, [~wheat9]! Some comments on the patch:

 - CommonConfigurationKeysPublic is, well, public. We cannot remove these constants as they are going to be present in 2.3. We can only deprecate them and comment as unused.
 - MRAppMaster: Use the constant HttpConfig.Policy.HTTP_ONLY.name() instead of the string "HTTP_ONLY”.
 - In the few places that we used “//“, should we retain the old behavior and explicitly use the URL with scheme?
 - MiniMRYarnCluster: Shouldn’t use WebAppUtils for logging the JobHistoryserver’s address
 - HistoryViewer changes: Fix formatting to not have lines longer than 80 chars.
 - RMWebServices changes: Bind conf into the class and use WebappUtils.useHttps() instead of reading from request? We don’t want a user’s http request in a https setting to dictate this.
 - WebAppProxyServlet changes: What’s the use of AMUrlScheme? Just cache the conf and use WebappUtils.useHttps()?
 - TestRMWebServicesApps: Put some validation of the logsURL like before.

WebappUtils
 - loadSslConfiguration(): Not using the passed in conf at all.
 - Add a bit of javadoc for this method

YarnConfiguration:
 - Mark both the new keys that are added as @Private
 - Both RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP and RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTPS point to RM_WEBAPP_HTTPS_ADDRESS !
 - YARN_HTTP_POLICY_KEY: Fix formatting
- getRMDefaultPortNumber() method should use the new method instead of using RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP directly.
- Remove useHttps() method and only use WebappUtils.useHttps()? , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. In the few places that we used “//“, should we retain the old behavior and explicitly use the URL with scheme?

This is a general way of handling links for both http and https. Previously we've used your proposed scheme in the old HDFS UI, it was quite error-prone.

bq. getRMDefaultPortNumber() method should use the new method instead of using RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP directly.

It is a static method so I don't quite see choosing between {{RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP}} / {{RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTPS}} are possible. Do you have any idea?, The v7 patch addresses Vinod's comments., The v8 patch passes in the configuration in {{getRMDefaultPortNumber()}} so that it can display the correct error message., Seems like you missed this:

, branch-2 doesn't compile anymore with both JDK 7 and 6 after this. Reverting this fixes it. , We compiled it before but seems like it got stale. Fixing it on branch-2 rightaway.., Hm.. This file didn't exist on trunk, so that's how I missed it.., Here is a supplement patch for branch-2 that fixes the compilation error., Tx for the quick turnaround [~wheat9], I just committed the bug-fix to branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #482 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/482/])
