[[~haibochen] would you give more details? How many nodes were there? Launch failed for what purpose? If you can get launch failure exit code it will be help full. , Sorry for my delayed reply, [~rohithsharma]. I have added description to the problem I was thinking of, and a draft patch for review., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The added unit test in the patch is flaky. Will address it in a new patch, Ah, I see why the test was failing. I was trying to fail the AM launch with an instance of Exception, which is not counted as a reason to blacklist the node. Patch updated to address that., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The findbugs issues and unit test failures are unrelated., As of today there is way to remove blacklisted nodes for AM containers. Should be very careful to blacklist AM nodes. I see from patch that for all IOException during AM container launch failure are blacklisted. This would be a risk. 

My doubt is why NM with connectivity issues are blacklisted? These are recoverable and will be back to normal. Moreover these are capable of launching containers. Lets say if AM have resource constraint on specific nodes and these nodes get blacklisted, then there is no way to launch this AM on any nodes and hang forever., bq.  there is way to remove blacklisted nodes for AM containers
Do you mean to say there is NO way to remove blacklisted nodes from AM container? I thought about being more specific on the types of launch failures that we want to blacklist a node for, but from the stacktrace, it seems that SockeTimeoutException (which is the failure for which I want blacklist a node) is wrapped deep inside an IOException. Agree that we should be more specific here.

bq. My doubt is why NM with connectivity issues are blacklisted?
Ideally, they shouldn't. But we have observed that if NM do not recover form connectivity issues quickly enough (maybe say JVM was not responsive), RM will often try the subsequent AM launch attempts on the same node and fail the application eventually, which is highly undesirable. This spirit is the same as when we blacklist a node for an invalid container exist status. To have all nodes blacklisted because of this change, all of them need to have connectivity issues during the window when RM tries to launch the app AM container., bq. Do you mean to say there is NO way to remove blacklisted nodes from AM container?
Yup

bq. RM will often try the subsequent AM launch attempts on the same node and fail the application eventually,
Do you mean NM is unresponsive but NM heartbeats are sent to RM? , Yeah, NMs can be unresponsive during the heartbeat window, from what we can tell.  , Updated the patch to only blacklist a node upon AM launch failure due to SocketTimeoutException (up to three levels down in the cause chain),  Going three levels down so that the failures indicated in the above stacktrace can be captured., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The overall approach seems fine to me, but the {{TestRMAppAttemptTransitions}} failure looks related and doesn't fail without the patch.  Can you take a look at it?  Looks like you need to check {{instanceof}} before casting.  Also, on the depth of 3 thing, is there a reason the {{SocketTimeoutException}} won't be at the same depth each time?, Thanks [~rkanter] for your review!  I am not familiar with the RPC code, not sure if the SocketTimeoutException will always be at depth 3. But it looks to me that the raw exception can be wrapped multiple times. 
Do you think if it's safe to assume that NM connection is down once we see a SocketTimeoutException regardless of at which depth it appears? I'll update the patch to address checkstyle issue and test failures., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, I imagine the depth will vary depending on the timing and other factors of the error.  A depth of 3 sounds reasonable and we can always increase it later if we see that it's not enough.

+1, [~rohithsharma], any comments?, IMO, I have concern for blacklisting a AM node on SocketTimeoutException. It would simply lead to loose one of the *capable/healthy node* get blacklisted. The NM might be too busy at particular point of time, but it is capable for launching containers without any doubt. 
There is NO way to purge blacklisted nodes unless blacklisted node count reaches threshold. In socketTimeException, many healthy nodes get blacklisted. 

I would like to hear opinion from other community folks who worked on AM blacklisting feature. 
cc :/ [~jlowe] [~vvasudev] [~vinodkv] [~sunilg] [~djp], What about making this a configuration setting?  It seems like this shows up more on larger clusters (higher chance of network down, more nodes to deal with, etc.)., Thanks Ray for suggestion. That sounds good to me. [~jlowe] [~djp] Do you guys have experience on this issue? We'd appreciate your input on which is the preferred.  We have seen this issue with our customers fairly often. , Sorry for the long delay in responding -- was out of the office for quite a bit lately.

The approach seems reasonable to me assuming we're getting some level of retries during the AM launch from the container manager proxy in AMLauncher.  If we can't get an AM to launch on that node even after some retries then it is very likely a subsequent attempt will also fail.  IMHO that's an appropriate time to blacklist.  If the container manager proxy is _not_ doing the retries in this case then that would be the first place to fix -- we should be trying a bit harder to get the current attempt launched before jumping to blacklist conclusions.

I'm confused on how the NM is capable of regularly heartbeating (and thus getting scheduled for AM launches) but also regularly not responding to launch requests.  If this is a common occurrence then that needs to be root-caused.  This proposed change is not really a fix for that, just a workaround in case it occurs.  Without a fix it will lead to prolonged AM and task launch times, since I'm assuming AMs will see similar difficulties trying to launch tasks on a node if the RM cannot launch an AM on it., Thanks Jason for your valuable inputs.

bq. If this is a common occurrence then that needs to be root-caused.
this really make sense to me before going with this JIRA fix. , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
