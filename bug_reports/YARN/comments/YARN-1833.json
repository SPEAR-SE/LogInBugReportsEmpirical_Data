This message is automatically generated., The test failure is not related to the patch. It was reported at YARN-1591., Thanks Akira. Even I verified that it is not related to my patch., [~mdesai], instead of removing the check, could we investigate using UserGroupInformation.createUserForTesting. This will allow us to isolate the developer environment as a requirement to the correctness of the test., Thanks [~jeagles] for the suggestion. I did not think about that solution. Attaching the new patch with the dummyUser for the test and no Assert Removed., +1, theYARN-1833-v2.patch works and the unit test passed. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
