, patch seems fineÂ [~GergelyNovak]

I made a mistake earlier and was expecting node labels from another api. But its not needed as we dont have capacities per partition anyway.

Also we have a color coding issue when used cap of any queue is more that capacity, we have to turn from green to orange. We can do in another ticket.

If no objections, i can commit this tomo. [~GergelyNovak] could u pls confirm., [~sunilg] Thank you for the review. Can you please open the other ticket with the exact description of the color coding issue you discovered?, Sorry [~GergelyNovak]. I missed the same.

Committing this patch shortly and will raise for color coding issue for queue's sooner. Thanks., Thanks [~GergelyNovak] for the contribution., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13704 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13704/])
