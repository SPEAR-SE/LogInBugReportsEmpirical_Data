[Hi [~haibochen]

The current hbase version that timelineservice V2 depends on is 1.0.1. There is a jira in progress to upgrade to 1.1.3.  at YARN-5070

Although we would like to use hbase 1.2.x, phoenix presently does not have a supported release for hbase 1.2.x, so we will upgrade to hbase 1.2.x when the appropriate phoenix release is available.

thanks
Vrushali
, Thanks very much for pointing that out, [~vrushalic]. I completely missed that jira and didn't find relevant information in the documentation., Timeline Service v.2 documentation now states that it requires HBase 1.1.3. Closing.]
