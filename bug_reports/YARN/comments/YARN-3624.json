This message was automatically generated., [~jeagles] can you take a look on this?, This change solves this issue where users have specified a specific order of filter initializers in the config. The application history server then reorders the the timeline authentication initializer to be at the front of the list. This breaks users who are using web cookie-based login systems that require being run before timeline authentication. [~zjshen], do you see any issues with this change. Can you see anyone relying on the current behavior where initializers are reordered?, Patch looks fine assuming this change won't break anyone. Otherwise we will have to add a flag to enable this feature. At first look, that is not necessary., I think it should be fine overall. One difference I can think of is that now auth filter is before static user filter by default. If we reverse the order. pseudo auth's allowing anonymous config is useless with both filters loaded in the new order, because static user will be created before presenting it to auth filter. And user can remove static user filter from the config to get anonymous user work., Perhaps we can add some documentation about this interaction to the timeline site files. [~mitdesai], can you add the required documentation to document this interaction?, I can add that. Thanks for reviewing the patch.

[~zjshen], [~jeagles] Should we make that change as a part of a separate JIRA in this one? I think it would be good to have a documentation JIRA separate. But I am OK either way., Filed YARN-2679, Correction: YARN-3679, Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.1 into 2.7.2., [~zjshen] / [~jeagles] did you guys find some time to take a look at this or YARN-3679?, \\
