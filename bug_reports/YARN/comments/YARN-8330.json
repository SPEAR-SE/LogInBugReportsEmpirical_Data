[Trying to remember this issue, and post it here before forgot again: 
- The issue is caused by we send container information to ATS inside RMContainerImpl's constructor, we should not do it: 
{code}
 // If saveNonAMContainerMetaInfo is true, store system metrics for all
 // containers. If false, and if this container is marked as the AM, metrics
 // will still be published for this container, but that calculation happens
 // later.
 if (saveNonAMContainerMetaInfo && null != container.getId()) {
 rmContext.getSystemMetricsPublisher().containerCreated(
 this, this.creationTime);

, [~suma.shivaprasad] Thank you for the patch:

{code}
      boolean saveNonAMContainerMetaInfo =
          container.rmContext.getYarnConfiguration().getBoolean(
              YarnConfiguration
                  .APPLICATION_HISTORY_SAVE_NON_AM_CONTAINER_META_INFO,
              YarnConfiguration
                  .DEFAULT_APPLICATION_HISTORY_SAVE_NON_AM_CONTAINER_META_INFO);

      // If saveNonAMContainerMetaInfo is true, store system metrics for all
      // containers. If false, and if this container is marked as the AM, metrics
      // will still be published for this container, but that calculation happens
      // later.
      if (saveNonAMContainerMetaInfo && null != container.container.getId()) {
        container.rmContext.getSystemMetricsPublisher().containerCreated(
            container, container.creationTime);
      }
{code}

This part of code can be reused.  Can we create a private method for this?, Thanks [~suma.shivaprasad] for working on this patch. 
 As we discussed offline, publishing container events from constructor or in state ALLOCATED/AQUIRED doesn't solve the issue completely rather it just converges probability of occurrence. Containers could be released by AM without launching it. This scenario also end up in listing additional containers. 

ATSv2 publishes container info from NM which ensures actual containers which are launched. I think we can take similar approach from RM also to publish only when container state is RUNNING. OTH, this will not collect information on how many actual containers are created/allocated for this applications. 

I think to be more precise, we should follow atsv2 approach i.e publishing container information when container state is RUNNING.
 cc:/ [~jlowe], [~rohithsharma],Â 

To me it is fine that we publish ALLOCATED/ACQUIRED container to ATS since it is a user-visible container. Comparing to that, RESERVED container is not visible to app., To me this all depends upon the intent of how the ATS data is going to be consumed.  One use case of the container data would be to track every single allocation an RM ever did for an application, whether that allocation was used or not.  Calculating an application footprint (ala YARN-415) requires this kind of information, otherwise applications that abuse the allocation protocol and ask for lots of containers that are never launched would appear much smaller than they really are.  Getting this kind of information requires we record containers at the ALLOCATED state at a minimum.

That leaves the inherent race where containers can be allocated just as an AM tries to remove the allocation request and the container gets discarded.  Even after the change to record at ALLOCATED, {{yarn containers -list}} command also needs the ability to discern between containers that were never launched and containers that were so it can only list containers that actually ran the app's code.
, bq. yarn containers -list command also needs the ability to discern between containers that were never launched and containers that were so it can only list containers that actually ran the app's code.
Given we don't have such ability from yarn as of today, we can definitely consider for allocated state. 

[~leftnoteasy] if expectation of test is to consider only running containers, still test would fail if AM rejects allocation. , Thanks [~jlowe] [~rohithsharma] [~leftnoteasy] [~eyang] for reviewing the patch and feedback. Have updated the patch to publish containerCreated events only when the container reaches RUNNING state., If information is collected for end user consumption to understand their application usage, then by collecting RUNNING state might be sufficient.  End user should not be penalized for YARN framework deficiency.  If information is collected for system administrator to understand the cluster health and isolate which node is potentially causing container to fail, then reporting ALLOCATED/ACQUIRED is preferable.  Timeline server is optimized for end user application reporting, the extra data seems unnecessary at this time  However, more information is collected, it is easier to avoid writing similar code twice.  The report filtering can be done at Timeline server to fulfill both use cases.  It could be a problem to handy cap the data collection toward one use case only., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, One of the envisioned use-cases of ATSv2 was to record every container allocation for an application in order to do analysis like what is done in YARN-415.  That requires recording every container that enters the ALLOCATED state.

bq. If information is collected for end user consumption to understand their application usage, then by collecting RUNNING state might be sufficient.

That does not cover the case where an application receives containers but for some reason holds onto the allocations for a while before launching them.  Tez, for example, has some corner cases in its scheduler where it can hold onto container allocations for prolonged periods before launching them while it reuses other, already active containers.  Holding onto unlaunched container allocations is part of its footprint on the cluster.  Only showing containers that made it to the RUNNING is only telling part of the application's usage story.

Fixing the yarn container -list command problem does not mean the fix has to solely be in ATSv2.  If the data for a container in ATS is sufficient to distinguish allocated containers from running containers then this can, and arguably should be, filtered for the yarn container -list use-case.  If the data recorded for a container can't distinguish this then we should look into fixing that so it can be.  But I don't think we should pre-filter ALLOCATED containers on the RM publishing side and preclude the proper app footprint analysis use-case entirely.
, Thanks [~jlowe] [~eyang] Have updated patch to publish ALLOCATED events to ATS . In addition, containers could move to ACQUIRED state directly for opportunistic containers, hence publishing to ATS in that case as well. Raised a separate jira to support filtering containers by their status in Yarn client - https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-8572
