[Looks like the idea was to make it protobuf-serializable?  But we should be able to just serialize it as a string?, Agree. It should be serialized as PB object. [~bikassaha], I will resolve it as not a problem if you don't have further comments., The issue is why not use standard java URL instead of YARN specific URL. One of the things YARN URL does is serialize to PB but it can be serialized as a string instead. So what is the use of a YARN URL class? It just confuses users.]
