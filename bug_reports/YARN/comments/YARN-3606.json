[Looking at timestamp is the strategy chosen based on a key assumption : there is a single artifact to localise by downloading from a single shared filesystem. Trying to use local filesystems, each with a cached copy of the artifact, isn't what the NM expects to be doing. If it is, then the normal localisation checks aren't


I think the checksum is probably omitted as you have to read the whole file to see if it has changed; plus there's the cost of actually recalculating that checksum prior to launching every container. Timestamps aren't too great though â€”the check as stands will reject the same file with two different times *or* two differently sized files with the same timestamp.]
