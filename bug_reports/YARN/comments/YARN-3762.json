[Here is a patch that protects FSParentQueue members with read-write locks. , Sorry, I forgot to rebase and included some HDFS change as well., Changed it to critical and targeting 2.8.0, as it only fails the application and not the RM., \\

This message was automatically generated., The patch just adds read-write locks to address any races. Haven't added any tests since it is hard to test race conditions. The code changed is accessed directly or indirectly by existing tests. Running jcarder should catch any deadlocks introduced by this change., [~kasha], Thanks for the patch

* In the {{assignContainer}} method, you are sorting the collection under a write lock and then assigning the container within the read lock, what happens if the collection is modified in between.. shouldnt we have the write lock encompass both operations ? I agree, It will not lead to the Exception (which is the point of the JIRA) but I feel it should be done for correctness.

* One other possible improvement is maybe instead of using a List and sorting it everytime, we could use a Sorted Bag (MultiSet) ? which keeps the list in sorted order ?
, Thanks for the review, Arun. Good points.

bq. what happens if the collection is modified in between..
The two possible modifications are adding/removing a child queue. Adding a child queue to the end of the list doesn't affect container assignment. Removing a child queue affects container assignment, but that is a good thing. 
We should probably add a comment to that effect so we don't forget this in the future.

bq. instead of using a List and sorting it everytime, we could use a Sorted Bag (MultiSet) ? 
One issue with using a sorted list is the sorting happens on addition/removal. FSQueues already in the list also change affecting the "order". May be, we could remove and re-insert the queue if anything changes, but that is a much bigger change and needs to be carefully evaluated for performance., Updated the patch to add more comments. , Makes sense
+1, LGTM, \\
