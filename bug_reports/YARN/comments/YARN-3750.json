[As i understand YARN-3069 will fix this too. Else we can add to yarn-default.xml 
{code}
   <property>
    <description>
    URL of  log aggregation server, NMs redirect web UI users to this URL where aggregated-logs are served
    </description>
    <name>yarn.log.server.url</name>
    <value></value>
</property>
{code}

Any comments ? Should i make this duplicate?, Yes, this is duplication. Let us close this.]
