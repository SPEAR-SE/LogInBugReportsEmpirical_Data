[Attaching a patch that is to be used as discussion and illustrate what is going on. I'm not assuming this is the correct approach since the could be many ways to address this issue., This is making a lot of unit tests take a lot longer than they should.  NonAggregatingLogHandler is keeping applications alive as long as the logs are around, and the NM tries to wait for applications to finish cleaning up when it tears down.  That leads to long delays in unit tests that use the minicluster.

My initial reaction was the minicluster should automatically set the log deletion to 0, but I can see the desire to keep container logs around for test debugging.  What if there was a way to tell the non-aggregating log handler to _not_ delete logs?  Applications would then complete quickly rather than linger as they are doing today.  I propose the minicluster ask for this by default, as IMHO it's the responsibility of the unit test running the minicluster to perform cleanup of the test directories (including the minicluster local and log dirs), and that would leave the option to the minicluster user whether to keep logs for debugging or clean them up with all the other test data.  Thoughts?
