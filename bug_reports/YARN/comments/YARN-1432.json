[Is it mandatory to have the OS user and kerberos users with same name, I guess if you use LinuxContainer and create local user accounts then there will be no problem. I think this issue is caused by  MAPREDUCE-5208 which now enforces user to use LinuxContainer instead of DefaultContainer when setup  security mode., Hi [~ramgopalnaali] For the different users to run in the Kerberos set up, LinuxContainerExecutor should be used. For more detailed security set up , kindly refer [Hadoop In Security Mode | http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SecureMode.html]]
