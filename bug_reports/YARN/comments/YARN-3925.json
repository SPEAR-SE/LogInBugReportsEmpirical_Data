This message was automatically generated., Nice catch, [~zxu]!

I think the patch will work, but it is a bit convoluted to use a new dir allocator and a new config property as a roundabout way to call LocalDirAllocator.AllocatorPerContext.getLocalPathToRead which is not a very complicated function.  LocalDirsHandlerService already has the list of Paths to check, so if we just refactored the getLocalPathToRead functionality into a reusable Path utility function to locate a subpath given a list of top-level paths to search it would be very straightforward., Thanks for the review [~jlowe]! That is a very good suggestion. I uploaded a new patch YARN-3925.001.patch which addressed your comments. I add a private method {{getPathToRead}} in LocalDirsHandlerService, which is almost the same as {{LocalDirAllocator#getLocalPathToRead}}. Please review it., \\

, thanks [~jlowe] for reviewing and committing the patch! , Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?, I pulled this into 2.6.3 as well.]
