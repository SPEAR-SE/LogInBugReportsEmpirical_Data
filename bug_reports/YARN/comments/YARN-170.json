[bq. This could be avoided if the NodeStatusUpdaterImpl were to stop the NodeManager by calling its stop method directly.
NodeStatusUpdater shouldn't call NodeManager stop directly, it violates the composition hierarchy. Instead NM's stop() should simply be re-entrant., I'm new to the codebase, so let me know if I'm misunderstanding the way things work, but the way I was looking at it was:

The NodeStatusUpdater signalling by stopping itself and expecting the NodeManager to notice seems like an unnecessary overloading of the NodeStatusUpdater shutdown, requiring the extra coordination of the NodeStatusUpdater's hasToReboot variable.  In a hierarchy of services, shouldn't the parents stop first, and be responsible for stopping their descendants?  The way it's implemented now violates the hierarchy as well, just in a less direct way that tangles the already complicated shutdown procedure., You are mostly right. The NodeStatusUpdater is the component responsible for communicating with RM constantly. In some cases, like a network parition, or when RM reboots, RM asks the NMs to shutdown or reboot. In this case, NodeStatusUpdater needs to inform its parent i.e. NodeManager to shutdown. To avoid stopping it directly, it should ideally send a signal to the NM. Today we achieve it via stateChanged event, NodeManager listens on state change events and shuts itself down. The shortest path to fixing the issue you mentioned is by making stop re-entrant., Ok, I understand better now.  I wrote it so that the NodeStatusUpdater signals to the NodeManager with an event. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Vinod, do you have any more comments before we commit this?, Looked at the patch. I still see that the shutdown hook and NodeStatusUpdater signal can race and stop the NM twice. The correct fix is to make the NM stop() re-entrant as I mentioned before.

The current patch does clean up the event flow a bit, so I am okay with the change from stateChangeListener to explicit event handling. But we do need the stop re-entrancy. Let me know if you think otherwise.

The test also doesn't exactly validate that the above race doesn't happen anymore. With little effort, it can be changed to do so, and validate my claim that the race can still happen with the latest patch., Oops you're right about the race still being there.  I'll make stop() re-entrant and modify the test. , Uploaded a new patch and verified that the test in it fails without the change., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
