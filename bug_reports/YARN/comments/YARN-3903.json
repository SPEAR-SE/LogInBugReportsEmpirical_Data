This message was automatically generated., Hi, 

I believe these whitespaces & codestyle errors are legacy issue, and not introduced by the patch.
May fill another ticket for them.

, I would like to understand the request better. Is the request to avoid a specific queue preempt resources from other queues? Or, is it to avoid preempting resources from a specific queue? 
, The latter one.
I encountered the requirement that needs to prevent particular jobs from being preempted.
This can either be done at queue-level or job-level. IMHO queue level have the advantage of transparency over job-level., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Just realized this is duplicated by YARN-4462. [~He Tianyi] - sorry for missing this JIRA thus far. YARN-4462 has been committed since. Could you please take a look and see if that meets your requirements? , Yes, it does.
Thanks for following up.]
