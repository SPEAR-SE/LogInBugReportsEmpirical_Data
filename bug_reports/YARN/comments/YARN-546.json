[I checked in the code and that appears to be correct.  The event log in hadoop 1 was broken for a long time until a recent issue I fixed, which leads me to suspect that nobody has really been using it.  I've also heard complaints that, because an entry is logged for each node update, it contains too much information and is not very helpful.  I think we should consider removing it in Hadoop 2.0 entirely., It looks like there is nothing much logged in event log and majority seems to be just node updates. If no one votes against to have this removed then here is a patch for review., [~sandyr] didn't you mention that you fixed this as part of a different jira ?, I think the issue still exists.  Just filed YARN-1383 to take these node updates out of the event log., Resolving duplicate of YARN-1383, I've spoken to a few people that still see the event log as valuable.  Independent of what we choose to do in YARN-1383, we should make disabling it an option.  Will post a patch here soon.

I'm going to put the option into the allocations file instead of as a yarn config so that it can be turned off and on., *off and on at runtime, Thought about this again and I think the option is better as a YARN config.  Added yarn.scheduler.fair.event-log-enabled.  If the need arises in the future we can add controls in the allocations file for turning on and off different types of logs., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Sandy. Couple of nits:
# {code}
+  /** Whether to enable the Fair Scheduler event log */
+  protected static final String EVENT_LOG_ENABLED = CONF_PREFIX + "event-log-enabled";
+  protected static final boolean DEFAULT_EVENT_LOG_ENABLED = false;
{code}
Both protected? At least the config name should be public, no?
# {code}
+  public boolean getEventLogEnabled() {
+    return getBoolean(EVENT_LOG_ENABLED, DEFAULT_EVENT_LOG_ENABLED);
+  }
{code}
May be rename it to {{isEventLogEnabled()}} to reflect boolean return? Also, in many other cases (RM etc.), we have these methods or config-accesses in the class that uses them and not in *Configuration. Any reason to not follow the same?

Agreed that it's non-standard compared to the rest of YARN, but I'm following the convention used by the other Fair Scheduler configs.

Will upload a patch that changes "get" to is and makes those constants public., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
