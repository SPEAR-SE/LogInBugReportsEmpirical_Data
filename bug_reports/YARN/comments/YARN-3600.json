[[~vinodkv] ran into this recently... can you guys take a look, It was failing in both cases when app is completed or killed and also null was displayed when AM container  is not launched. Uploading a patch with the correction. [~devaraj.k] can you please take a look, reviewing and kicking jenkins., \\

This message was automatically generated., So the change does fix the broken link issue, but it seems to me other things are broken with this page.  Obviously if it ran for a while it got an AM and there fore should have a valid container.  But I guess that link only works if its actually running?

The container table below that also confused me a bit.  I thought at first it was list of AM containers, but after playing with it its really list of running containers.  I think we should add heading for that.  I filed separate jira for those things.

Anyway, +1.  Thanks!

This message was automatically generated., I think the intent here was to be able to access logs for a completed job - from the RM UI. That used to work earlier and is extremely useful., Hey [~sseth],

 Can you check to make sure YARN-3603 covers what you also think it should do?  I added the bit about logs in there but I may have forgot about something else., hi [~sseth],
Was not aware of the earlier approach and also as container information is not available i took this approach, but IMO approach to select log in the earlier approach you mentioned is not so user friendly better we display the log url in the app attempt's page itself IIUC which is what is suggested by [~tgraves] in YARN-3603. Is that fine ?, Sounds good. Sorry I missed YARN-3603., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #191 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/191/])
