This message is automatically generated., Test failure seems to be due to YARN-417., I had originally left the loop without a timeout because eventually YARN is supposed to recognize that the app succeeded/killed/failed or it would expire and fail the app. Is that not happening?

I agree that a timeout would be more useful. How about adding a timeout to the monitoring method such that it throws an exception if the desired end state is not reached within that time. With the code change in the patch, it would end up crashing with an NPE, right?, Addressed Bikas's comments., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good. Thanks for the changes. +1. Some minor nits
1) Might be good to do currentTime - startTime > 5 seconds instead of using a counter. That way its delinked from the the sleep period of the loop.
2) Can we include the expected and actual states in the final exception. It would be convenient to see what state the app was in when we expected it to reach some other state.
3) The new test might have to change because YARN-417 changed DistShell to not accept 0 container launches. So the test will get an exception but not the one it expects. Maybe add check that exception contains expected message?, Thanks for the review Bikas. New patch attached with comments addressed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
