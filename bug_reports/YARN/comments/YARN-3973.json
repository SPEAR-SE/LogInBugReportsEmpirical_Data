[[~imenache] has just reported to me a NPE when running the reservation system in current trunk (part of testing of YARN-3656). Thanks Ishai for reporting this.

[~leftnoteasy], I think this is due to YARN-2003 changes. In particular we get and NPE when running:  CapacityScheduler.getDefaultPriorityForQueue()
due to the ReservationQueue (inheriting from LeafQueue) the get getDefaultApplicationPriority() which returns null for queues that are not in the config file,
such as the dynamic queues of the reservation system. 

A possible fix is to override getDefaultApplicationPriority() in ReservationQueue to return some default priority value: 
{code}
  @Override
  public Priority getDefaultApplicationPriority() {
    return Priority.newInstance(0);
  }
{code}

But I wonder whether there is anything more principled, [~leftnoteasy] any advise?. , Thanks [~curino] reporting and analyzing this issue, I think it should be safe to add a default implementation returns a non-null priority at AbstractCSQueue. 

[~sunilg], thoughts?, [~leftnoteasy] what you propose makes more sense. From a quick test on actual cluster, it looks like it works. 

The problem during application submission is in fact not addressed by overriding just in ReservationQueue, 
ParentQueue must also provide an implementation (due to the reservation mechanics for app submission), 
thus doing this in AbstractCSQueue seems the right way. 

I uploaded a simple patch for this, but please double check this carefully (I am not familiar with priority mechanics). , \\

This message was automatically generated., [~curino], looked at code again. I think to solve the NPE issue, it's better to check at {{CapacityScheduler#getDefaultPriorityForQueue}}, when {queue#getDefaultApplicationPriority}} is null, it should return CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.DEFAULT_CONFIGURATION_APPLICATION_PRIORITY instead.

Adding a default implementation to AbstractCSQueue can not leverage defined DEFAULT_APPLICATION_PRIORITY., [~leftnoteasy], this makes sense. I am testing in a cluster now., [~leftnoteasy], it seems to work fine on a test cluster, however please double check this before committing it.
, Thanks [~curino].
+1 to latest patch. [~sunilg], could you also take a look at it?, Thanks [~curino]  for reporting this and thanks [~leftnoteasy]  for analysis. 
Latest patch looks good to me. It will solve the problem. , \\
