[According to the document of Redhat 7, it is not recommended to use libcgroup to do the cpu isolation. So YARN-2194 is working on systemd-based solution. Will update a patch for that jira soon., [~ywskycn] looking forward for the patach. 
Should we also support the libcgroup of Redhat 7?, [~beckham007], Redhat doesn't recommand that way. "To avoid conflicts, do not use libcgroup tools for default resource controllers (listed in Available Controllers in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7) that are now an exclusive domain of systemd." So we plan to move the cpu part using systemd., [~ywskycn] Understood, thanks., Tx for the discussion. Closing as dup of YARN-2194.]
