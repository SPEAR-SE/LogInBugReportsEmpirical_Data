This message is automatically generated., Manually tested by commenting out the line that triggers the START transition in RMAppManager submitApplication. This ensures the app is in NEW and without a currentAttempt causing the null ref reported (which is now at line 111).

, I have hit this issue in Hadoop 2.5.1 - I am guessing this fix was never committed into the master branch?, Just verified the fix was committed to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.5, and branch-2.5.1. What makes you think the fix wasn't committed? Is it possible there is another issue? Could you post logs from when you ran into this? ]
