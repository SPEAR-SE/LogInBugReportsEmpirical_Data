[Possible approaches:

# Throw in a sleep before checking, and hopefully the process would have received the signal. Simple to do, but need not always work.
# Check if the process died OR (the signal has been delivered AND the process is not stuck in kernel mode), A short sleep could be put in a loop, so that the test can finish quickly but take as long as it needs

{code}
for (max tries) {
  sleep(100 ms)
  if (process dead) break
}
{code}, A combination of the two approaches might be the best. Essentially, do what Sandy says, and then if the process hasn't died, check the status of the process in /proc/pid.

Will put up a preliminary patch, and we can reiterate if need be., Here is a trivial patch that seems to be fixing the test:
# Added a simple loop to check if process is alive.
# Ran the test in a loop and noticed no failures., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Why we have this MR code dealing with processes? That seems like leftovers that should not be there, right? Other than that it looks good, the YARN test., And this JIRA should be moved to YARN., Thanks Alejandro. Agree that the mapreduce version has to be removed - create MAPREDUCE-5077 to address that. Moved this patch to YARN, and will update it to fix only the yarn part of the test., Uploading a patch that fixes only the YARN version of TestProcfsBasedProcessTree.

The MR version is to be removed along with other cleanup in MAPREDUCE-5077., +1 pending test-patch, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
