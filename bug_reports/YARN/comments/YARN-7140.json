, InterfaceStability is changed to Evolving. But once we release, all these should be Unstable. Unstable is appropriate one. , [~rohithsharma], I referred to https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/InterfaceClassification.html#Unstable
{panel}
Incompatible changes to Unstable APIs are allowed at any time. *This usually makes sense for only private interfaces.*

*However one may call this out for a supposedly public interface to highlight that it should not be used as an interface; for public interfaces, labeling it as Not-an-interface is probably more appropriate than “Unstable”.*

Examples of publicly visible interfaces that are unstable (i.e. not-an-interface): GUI, CLIs whose output format will change.

..............
* Aren’t all public interfaces stable?

One may mark a public interface as evolving in its early days. Here one is promising to make an effort to make compatible changes but may need to break it at minor releases.
{panel}

As you can see the guideline is to make an interface Unstable typically for Private interfaces only unless its something like a CLI. So I made it evolving based on my understanding of above.

Will we making any changes to CollectorInfo in future? Most probably not. But as it is new feature I thought better to mark it evolving instead of stable. Not sure if it is unstable going by definition above. Thoughts? 
Frankly CollectorInfo APIs' are not even required to be called by AM. It is just passed onto TimelineV2ClientImpl., Going through the link provided, Evolving would be appropriate one as per description. Lets commit this patch then. If there is any objections, will discuss it later., committed to trunk/YARN-5355_branch2, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #12823 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/12823/])
YARN-7140. CollectorInfo should have Public visibility. Contributed by (rohithsharmaks: rev 4a83170be477e6f39f134207f74084888174e96b)

, I think this needs to go into branch-3.0 as well., Yep, this need to be committed to branch-3.0! I have committed it to branch-3.0 as well. thanks [~jlowe]]
