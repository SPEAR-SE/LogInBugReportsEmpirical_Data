This message is automatically generated., the WebProxyServlet does support appending the client-provided path and query strings, as I can verify it by simply curling a regular MapReduce app's proxy URL.  For example:

{noformat}
$ curl 'http://rmhost:8088/proxy/application_1424469840513_0001/foo/bar/boo?viewPath=a&other=b'     
<html>
  <head>
    <title>
      Moved
    </title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1>
      Moved
    </h1>
    <div>
      Content has moved 
      <a href="http://jhshost:19888/jobhistory/job/job_1424469840513_0001/foo/bar/boo?viewPath=a&amp;other=b">here</a>
    </div>
  </body>
</html>
{noformat}

However it does not properly handle URI fragments supplied by either the app or the client, and it doesn't honor query parameters set in the tracking URL by the app.

Thanks for the patch, Jian!  Patch looks good overall, and merging query strings between the client and the app-specified URL seems reasonable.  However it doesn't look like we're honoring any fragments provided by the client, and that would break clients for any app UIs that generate fragment-containing links., thanks for reviewing, Jason !
bq. However it doesn't look like we're honoring any fragments provided by the client, 
I was trying to do that, but after doing some research, looks like the fragments are not supposed to be sent to the server. So the proxy won't receive the fragments specified by the user, they are automatically stripped off., bq.

Not sure how we can even combine fragments - isn't only one fragment applicable against a URI?, bq.

Ah, yes that makes sense.  I'm +1 on the patch then.

bq. Not sure how we can even combine fragments - isn't only one fragment applicable against a URI?

That's what I was wondering about and thinking we may want to complain if both the app and the client are trying to mess with fragments at the same time.  However it sounds like we won't have the ability to tell if the client is using a fragment since it doesn't send it to the server., Any other comments?  Otherwise I will commit this tomorrow., Tested manually by applying this patch. Works fine with the kind of urls Tez is using. , Committing this., Thanks, Jian!

, Patch did not apply cleanly to 2.6.1. Had to fix minor merge conflicts in WebAppProxyServlet.java and removed ProxyUtils usage in test-case. 

Pulled this into 2.6.1. Ran compilation and TestWebAppProxyServlet before the push.]
