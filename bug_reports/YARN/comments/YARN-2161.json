This message is automatically generated., Looks good for the most part!  A few minor things:

{code}
+#if defined(__MACH__)
+  // only those fds are opened assuming no bug
+  fclose(LOGFILE);
+  fclose(ERRORFILE);
+  fclose(stdin);
+  fclose(stdout);
+  fclose(stderr);
+#else
   fcloseall();
+#endif
{code}

It would probably be better to detect if fcloseall is a valid function.  If not, then use the manual fclose.  This would allow the code to run on not just OS X but other systems as well.

{code}
+#if defined(__FreeBSD__) || defined(__MACH__)
+  fprintf(LOGFILE, "Failed to mount cgroup controller, not supported\n");
+  return -1;
+#else
{code}

I sort of prefer the fix from YARN-1327 here, where it does +#ifndef __linux instead.

{code}
+#if !defined(__MACH__) // macosx do not have user bin
   if (check_user("bin") == NULL) {
     printf("FAIL: failed check for whitelisted system user bin\n");
     exit(1);
   }
+#endif
{code}

Rather than ignore this test completely, can we chose a different user instead?

Also, can you incorporate the other changes from YARN-1327 so that we can do one commit?

Thanks!

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the review Allen. Attach new version of the patch, changes:
1. use cmake CHECK_FUNCTION_EXISTS to check fcloseall exists
2. change user bin to user daemon (which both linux and macosx have)
3. add some fix in YARN-1327 (setpgid and libgen.h)

For fixing YARN-2701, i need to revert the native code changes for mkdirs in container-executor.c, The changes for mkdirs in container-executor.c bring the race condition when two containers are trying to check and create directory at the same time., Hi [~xgong], sorry for break the code. I see in YARN-2701 you already have fix code, but decide to revert the code in the end to be more safe, but this breaks the mac build, how  about use  #ifdef to use old code when compiling on glibc > 2.10(http://linux.die.net/man/2/openat) and use your fixing code otherwise?, I've re-opened YARN-2701.]
