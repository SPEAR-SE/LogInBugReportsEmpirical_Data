[[issue was seen|https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/2486//testReport/org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager/TestRMRestart/testRMRestartWaitForPreviousAMToFinish/], just discovered MockRM.waitForState(appAttempt, RMAppAttemptState)... simple ignores the passed in application attempt and always considers current application attempt. Fixing it. *RMAppAttempt attempt = app.getCurrentAppAttempt();*
{code}
  public void waitForState(ApplicationAttemptId attemptId, 
                           RMAppAttemptState finalState)
      throws Exception {
    RMApp app = getRMContext().getRMApps().get(attemptId.getApplicationId());
    Assert.assertNotNull("app shouldn't be null", app);
    RMAppAttempt attempt = app.getCurrentAppAttempt();
    int timeoutSecs = 0;
    while (!finalState.equals(attempt.getAppAttemptState()) && timeoutSecs++ < 40) {
      System.out.println("AppAttempt : " + attemptId 
          + " State is : " + attempt.getAppAttemptState()
          + " Waiting for state : " + finalState);
      Thread.sleep(1000);
    }
    System.out.println("Attempt State is : " + attempt.getAppAttemptState());
    Assert.assertEquals("Attempt state is not correct (timedout)", finalState,
        attempt.getAppAttemptState());
  }
