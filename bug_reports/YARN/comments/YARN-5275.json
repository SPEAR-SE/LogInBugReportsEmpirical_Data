[Thanks [~ozawa]. I will give a run with YARN-3368 ui and will share the feedback., [~sunilg], any findings to report?, Ping, [~sunilg]..., Sorry folks for the delay.
I tested latest UI and all pages are getting loaded up. There were some minor changes done by at the time of YARN-3368 branch merge to avoid this issue.

We have not integrated the time line pages (for atsv2) yet. Once that is done, i ll test one more time and can reopen this ticket if needed. For now, this can be closed. ]
