This message is automatically generated., Hi [~lichangleo], thanks for working on this fix.  Can you resolve the javac warning and run the TestRMContainerImpl test locally with the patch to verify the patch is not the cause?  It seems to be persistently failing., AMs also are expected to keep unregistering after the initial unregister so as to handle things like state-store persistence of the final-state. Your patch will start throwing exceptions to the AMs while the final state is being persisted. /cc [~jianhe]

I think a simpler solution is to simply let in and ignore all the allocate requests once the apps reaches the FINAL_SAVING state., Thanks for suggestions! I am planning to come back to work on this issue soon., updated my patch, the current approach ignores allocate requests when app attempt is in final_saving, finishing or isAppFinalStateStored, \\

+        AllocateResponse allocateResponse =
+                recordFactory.newRecordInstance(AllocateResponse.class);
+        return allocateResponse;
{noformat}

Nit: This should use AllocateResponse.newInstance instead of recordFactory.

We probably shouldn't be returning a truly empty allocate response record.  Callers will get null for many fields they try to lookup like available resources.  Ideally they should be protected from that, but I suspect many will not be.  We should provide an empty list of containers, a headroom of zero resources, etc.  Something a bit more helpful than a bunch of nulls.

Another possible approach rather than short-circuiting the complete AllocateResponse message is to short-circuit the scheduler.allocate call with a canned Allocation.  Then we can let the rest of the code work with that bogus Allocation and the app can continue to be updated on node health, AMRM token updates, etc., Thanks [~jlowe] for review! have updated my patch according to your suggestion. Let me know if you have other concerns. Thanks!, \\

This message was automatically generated., The check style is not related to my change. [~jlowe] could you help review the latest patch. Thanks!, Thanks for updating the patch, Chang!  It's looking much better, and all that is left now are mostly nits.

The stubbed allocation should be constant like EMPTY_ALLOCATION in AbstractYarnScheduler.  There's no need to construct the exact same object each time we need it.

For improved readability it'd be nice to have a line between the new unit test and the test before it.

The new unit test should be named a bit more specifically than just "bad allocation."  Something like testAllocateAfterUnregister since that's literally what the test is doing.

Could you elaborate on why the sleep(1000) is needed?  In general we want to avoid any unnecessary sleeps, as our unit tests take too long as it is already.  Should we be draining a dispatcher instead?
