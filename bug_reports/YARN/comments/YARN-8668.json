, Thanks [~Cyl] for reporting the issue, this is by design in CS. 

Using computeAvailableContainers can get correct result when both DominantResourceCalculator and DefaultResourceCalculator enabled. Using fitsIn(res, res) only works when DominantResourceCalculator is enabled. To me, the correct solution is to use fits(resourceCalculator, res, res)

I don't think fix required in CS., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for clarifying this, close this Jira as not a problem!]
