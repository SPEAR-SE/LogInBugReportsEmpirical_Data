[Junping, I got the latest trunk and tried a couple of tests, they actually pass. Could you check again ? thx., I believe the failures witnessed here were before I committed the addendum patch from HADOOP-11017. Most of these should be fixed now. , Thanks [~jianhe] and [~kasha] for quickly reply. Looks like trunk is fine for now as I retry the Jenkins test in YARN-668. Will close this JIRA soon., In addition, still left a test failure on TestWorkPreservingRMRestart. Filed YARN-2596 to track this.]
