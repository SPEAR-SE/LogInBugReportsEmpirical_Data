[Have some investigation in this problem. The root cause is that RM web UI only shows the log of AM container. For the logs of other containers, users need to go to the corresponding NM web UI to see it. The bad thing there's no links to redirect users.

As AHS list the containers of the applications as well, and provide the link to the container logs, RM web UI is good to do the same thing to simply the way for users to look for container logs., At runtime, you can see the links to the containers and logs. After app is finished, you have to go to node->tools->local logs->logs->userlogs->app->container->stdout.

So just DO NOT REMOVE them after app is finished.]
