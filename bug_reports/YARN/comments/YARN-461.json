This message is automatically generated., Not sure this is correct.

The default value for queue is 'default'. An empty string means users specifically set it. We shouldn't override it., Same for app name., My thinking was that a queue name of "" is most likely to come up when a user means not to specify any queue (as it was when I got hit by this).  Are you saying "" should be a valid queue name?  To me it seems like a lot of confusing situations could arise if a user configures this accidentally., If the user specifically set the queue name to be empty it's an error. We shouldn't second-guess him, just throw an error since "" is an invalid name., Throwing an error seems reasonable to me. , Sorry, misextrapolated your first comment, that seems reasonable to me too.  It looks like the capacity scheduler already rejects the app in this situation, so I'll just fix the fair scheduler to do the same., Uploaded a patch to throw an exception when the submited app has an empty application name or queue name., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
