[Is this related to YARN-4484? cc [~sunilg]., Thanks [~Tao Yang]. There was a discussion for this in YARN-4415
[~djp], this issue still persists and internally we disabled app to run in Queue B which is with 0% cap for label1. Analysis seems correct here, and we could pre-create PartitionQueueCapacitiesInfo for queue B so that max value also should be 0%.., Thanks [~djp] and [~sunilg] for your reply. The solution makes sense to me.]
