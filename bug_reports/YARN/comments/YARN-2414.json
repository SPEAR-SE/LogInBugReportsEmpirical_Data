[The following code makes in AppBlock makes the assumption that the attempt is not null:
{code}
    setTitle(join("Application ", aid));

    RMAppMetrics appMerics = rmApp.getRMAppMetrics();
    RMAppAttemptMetrics attemptMetrics =
        rmApp.getCurrentAppAttempt().getRMAppAttemptMetrics();
{code}, Assigned it to myself, will post a patch soon, Ran into this as well.  Any update, [~leftnoteasy]?, [~jlowe],
Stuck in other stuffs these days, will create a patch for this later.

Thanks,, Attached a simple fix for this issue.
Please kindly view. 

Thanks,, Thanks, Wangda!  Looks good overall.  Nit: appMerics should be appMetrics.

Have you done any manual testing with this patch?  Seems like it would be straightforward to mock up an injector with a mock context containing an app with no attempts.  With that the unit test can verify render doesn't throw.   Thinking something along the lines of WebAppTests.testPage/testBlock., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Thanks for your review and comments! Will add a test for it according to your suggestions later.

Wangda, Attached patch addressed [~jlowe]'s comment, added a test with mock injector. Without this patch, test will fail.
