I think we should wait till it finishes right? [ExecutorService#awaitTermination|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ExecutorService.html#awaitTermination%28long,%20java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit%29]

Also we should add timeout per Test may be in this case we may have to increase timeout period. , Thanks, Omkar! I've fixed the termination issue. On the other hand, I removed the timeout annotations because they may be too tight for the modified tests. In addition, test.timeout has already been set in pom.xml of hadoop-yarn. Therefore, it's no longer necessary to add timeout now. IMHO, the default timeout needs to be override only when the expected execution time of a test may be longer than the default one., Thanks [~zjshen] .. +1, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch mostly looks good to me too.

I think the timeout are useful. We have to fail faster in small tests like this instead of waiting for 10 mins. Please add them back. Tx., Add timeout back., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
