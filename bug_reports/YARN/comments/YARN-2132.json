[Thanks for picking this up, Vamsee. 

Since it need not always be an exception while connecting to ZooKeeper, I would reword it to say something like "Exception while executing a ZooKeeper operation". While at it, we could also change the subsequent message to something like "Retrying operation. Retry - ", but I am not particular on the second part., Good idea.
