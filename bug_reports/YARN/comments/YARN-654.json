This message is automatically generated., Is the test failure related?, It might be cleaner to use Google preconditions and throw standard IllegalArgumentException.

I do not think so. All tests are passing in my local machine., use Google preconditions and throw standard IllegalArgumentException., Minor change to allow 0 for progress indicator since that is valid. Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.1-beta. Thanks Xuan!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4082 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4082/])
