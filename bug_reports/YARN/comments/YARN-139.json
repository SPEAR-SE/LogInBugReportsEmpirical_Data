This message is automatically generated., Tried out the patch, but it doesn't completely fix the problem.  It does prevent spurious exception traces in the handler threads when they are interrupted, but the exception trace reported in the description is coming from the thread calling stop() on the AsyncDispatcher service.  It was interrupted while trying to join with the handling thread, and that exception is still being logged.

Also related to the user confusion are the other errors and warnings being logged during normal AM shutdown.  Some examples:

I can file another JIRA if we'd rather handle those separately., bq. Tried out the patch, but it doesn't completely fix the problem. It does prevent spurious exception traces in the handler threads when they are interrupted, but the exception trace reported in the description is coming from the thread calling stop() on the AsyncDispatcher service. It was interrupted while trying to join with the handling thread, and that exception is still being logged.
I completely misread the JIRA description. Let's track the AsyncDispatcher logs separately.

We can simply check for {{!stopped}} before logging the exception to nix that.
