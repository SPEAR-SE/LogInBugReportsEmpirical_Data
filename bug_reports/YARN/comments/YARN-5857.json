[Guess this issue is result of test case relying on java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getActiveCount()
As the javadoc for this method (https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/api/java/util/concurrent/ThreadPoolExecutor.html#getActiveCount() ) says, it return the approximate number at the moment.
I feel we can rewrite this testcase using countdown latches to make test case more robust, please suggest, Agree.]
