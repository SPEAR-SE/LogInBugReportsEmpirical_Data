[I posted this issue in [TEZ-2338|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/TEZ-2338] but I feel this is not issue with tez side , we tried by adding this in our yarn-site.xml. This will ensure that the *launch_container.cmd* from the NM error seen does not get deleted ( will remain around for 20 mins - increase 1200 to a higher number if needed).
{code:xml}
    <property>
      <name>yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec</name>
      <value>1200</value>
    </property>
{code}
 We noticed one thing while running the *launch-container.cmd* located in hadoop _\tmp\..\appcache_ location. It arises an issue in accessing the *.dll* for running mapreduce on windows platform, ie. MSVCR100.dll message box was thrown while handling TEZ job.

*Error Message:*
{quote}"The program can't start because MSCVR100.dll is missing from your 
computer. Try reinstalling the program to fix this issue"{quote}
But we installed framework-4.5 in that NM node, and we also find MSVCR100.dll at C:\Windows\System32\ location. Even though we face same issue.

*Fix we tried:*
Then we downloaded dll-file fixer [download|http://download.dll-files.com/fixer/filest/dff_fdp2-msvcr100.exe] and reinstalled MSVCR100.dll file in NM machine.
After that we tried mapreduce program for TEZ job got submitted and completed successfully and No ISSUE occured

Is this a proper fix for the above Exception and what the reason for this Exception?, Hello [~KaveenBigdata].  Nice debugging!

The native components for Hadoop on Windows are built using either Windows SDK 7.1 or Visual Studio 2010.  Because of this, there is a runtime dependency on the C++ 2010 runtime dll, which is MSVCR100.dll.  You are correct that the fix in this case is to install the missing dll.  I believe this is the official download location:

Since this does not represent a bug in the Hadoop codebase, I'm resolving this issue as Not a Problem., Hi [~cnauroth],

Thanks for your kind responce. :-), I am a new learner.
Today ,I have get the similar problem as above.
First,I use hadoop 2.7.1 on the centos cluster,and use Eclipse at window 7 to code the MapReduce program .
As I run my program ,there are error as following:

2016-04-20 19:43:59,559 WARN  util.NativeCodeLoader (NativeCodeLoader.java:<clinit>(62)) - Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform... using builtin-java classes where applicable

================
I have searching the Internet, and then learn about this discuss between you .

Looking forward you response.

Thankyou very much .


======
I  have change from hadoop 2.7.1 to hadoop-2.7.2, the error remaining.

I have try to install the MSVCR100.dll, the error reamining.

Thankyou
