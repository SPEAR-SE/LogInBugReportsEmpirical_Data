This message was automatically generated., I also hit this problem when I practiced to write a simple scheduler. This issue made me have to implement from AbstractYarnScheduler. 
[~leftnoteasy], is there a story behind the scene we are not aware of ? 

, Fixed checkstyle issues, Patch LGTM, thanks [~varun_saxena].

[~xiaodike],
IMHO, we should place getTransferredContainers to YarnScheduler. I don't know if there's any story of that, but we should fix it :).

I will keep this JIRA open for a few days to see if there is any opposite opinions., This behavior is added in YARN-1041. Keeping cc:/[~jianhe] to get his opinion., \\
