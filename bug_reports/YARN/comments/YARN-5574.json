[I don't see any difference when I set "yarn.log.dir" or not in this testcase.
Even I set this into system property as {{System.setProperty("yarn.log.dir", "aaa");}}, nothing is written into this dir. It seems that {{conf.set("yarn.log.dir", "target");}} here does not work in any case., I'm unsurprised.  Otherwise this JIRA would have been filed years ago.

I didn't do any validation of the property.  I was merely looking at bare yarn.* properties for YARN-5575 and noticed the inconsistent use of yarn.log.dir.  Maybe we should change the summary and description to either fix or remove the property.]
