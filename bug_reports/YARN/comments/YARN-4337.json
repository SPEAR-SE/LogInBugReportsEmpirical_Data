[I'm looking at the WebServicesIntro.md file, and I don't see that error:

{code}
#### JSON response with single resource

HTTP Request: GET http://rmhost.domain:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps/application\_1324057493980\_0001

Response Status Line: HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Are you looking at the current version of the docs?, Thank you for the reply, [~adaniels], I changed the affect version to 2.6.x., I think after branch-2.7, we are not suing apt.vm file anymore. Those *.apt.vm are in 2.6.x, Yep, the error is there in 2.6.1, but it's fixed in 2.7.0 by YARN-3436.  Any reason not to close this as a dup?]
