[Uploaded a patch to address this JIRA. Basic idea is to treat "scheduled" state as "running" state  when a container is killed (CONTAINER_KILL event). If a container is in "scheduled" state, then it means that it is not yet launched or container is launched but it didn't yet receive the "CONTAINER_LAUNCHED" event from launcher. If a CONTAINER_KILL event is sent to a container in "scheduled" state, we handle the following two scenarios:

1. If the container is not launched yet, then we can catch this in containerslauncher.java and send a CONTAINER_KILLED_ON_REQUEST event to container, which triggers container cleanup (and container will transition to DONE eventually). 

2.On the other hand, if the container is launched and a kill event/signal is sent to container before it receives CONTAINER_LAUNCHED event, then fix will do the right thing by treating the container as running., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

In ContainersLauncher the exit code of a container that never launched should not be SUCCESS.  It should be treated the same as it is done in ContainerLaunch#validateContainerState when a container is killed before it is launched, and the error message should match as well since it's the same type of scenario.

Now that ContainersLauncher is sending the killed on request event even when it doesn't think the container is being launched or running at all, do we need to add some event handling for CONTAINER_KILLED_ON_REQUEST to more states following KILLING?  I'm thinking it is now possible for ContainerImpl to receive multiple of these which the state machine does not expect.  For example consider the following scenario:
# Container in SCHEDULED state waiting for LAUNCHED event
# Container receives KILL event and sends kill to launcher
# In the meantime container proceeds to launch a very quick process and LAUNCHED is sent to the container.  Event is ignored because the container is in KILLING state.
# Process runs extremely fast, so launcher sends CONTAINER_EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS event to the container and clears container from ContainersLauncher.
# Container receives exit success event in the KILLING state and moves to the EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS state.
# Launcher now finally receives the request to kill the container, but the container is no longer being tracked.  KILLED_ON_REQUEST is sent to the container as part of this patch.
# Container receives KILLED_ON_REQUEST event in the EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS state which is an invalid transition.  Similarly if it had progressed to the DONE state it also would be an invalid state transition.

I think we need to add some no-op transitions in states that can occur after KILLING if KILLED_ON_REQUEST is received to cover these race conditions.

The event field of LocalizationCleanupMatcher is not used and is not needed.  Checking for an instance of ContainerLocalizationCleanupEvent means we are also verifying the event type is CLEANUP_CONTAINER_RESOURCES.  Alternatively LocalizationCleanupMatcher could check for instanceof ContainerLocalizationEvent and verify the event is CLEANUP_CONTAINER_RESOURCES.
