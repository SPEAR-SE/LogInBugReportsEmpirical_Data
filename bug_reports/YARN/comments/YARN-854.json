, Attaching fix for branch 2.0. Could somebody please review.
Would be also good to reopen this for the merge. I don't have access to the reopen button., The changes to ResourceLocalizationService and ContainerLocalizer in the 2.0.x patch looks good to me. One question: are the changes to RegisterApplicationMasterResponsePBImpl that were done in the 2.1.x patch not necessary in the 2.0.x patch for some reason?

+1 pending an answer to the above question.

Thanks, Konst., Aaron thanks for the review.
The changes to RegisterApplicationMasterResponsePBImpl in this patch for trunk and branch 2.1 fix a bug introduced by YARN-610.
YARN-610 is not in 2.0.5 branch, so the changes are not applicable to 2.0.x and therefore not reflected in my patch.
Here is the [diff that visualises|https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blame/branch-2/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/api/protocolrecords/impl/pb/RegisterApplicationMasterResponsePBImpl.java] changes., Makes sense to me.

Thanks, Konst., Committed to branch 2.0.6., I have started the release process...

, Can anyone with committers JIRA rights add "2.0.6-alpha" to the "Fix version", please?, Done..]
