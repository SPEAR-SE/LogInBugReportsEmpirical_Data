[I believe the negative numbers were to indicate that the value is not available or cannot be reported due to lack of authorization.  Changing these to zero changes the API and breaks anyone depending upon that behavior., I agree to the internal logic, but concern is when the Application is finished the WebUI displays as -1 which I  feel this can be improved., This also appears in the REST service, so this is an API not just what humans see (and possibly screen-scraped by those that should have been using the REST API).  We could always translate the -1's into 'N/A' or "Unavailable' on the web UI, but changing the REST API is going to be trickier from a compatibility point of view., I think for UI dispaly 'N/A' is resonable, and REST we should keep existing behavior since it affect compatibility., I think this problem exists even FairScheduler.
FairSchedulerAppsBlock.java:
{code}
      .append(appInfo.getRunningContainers()).append("\",\"")
{code}, My bad, missed it. Thanks for pointing out, will update patch for it, \\
