This message is automatically generated., LGTM. Sorry for missing the windows build., [~cnauroth] [~ivanmi] Was this specific issue not already handled? The fact that directory traversal all the way to the top will not work on Windows so there was special logic for windows., Thanks Bikas for looping us in. Varun, HADOOP-8731 might be able to help. , Attached new patch fixing root cause in FSDownload.java. The patch should fail the HadoopQA because it fixes a currently failing test on Windows.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me. And the test passes after the patch too.

But I want to keep the code comment same as HADOOP-8731 for branch-1. Fixing that myself., Same patch as before but the code comment matching branch-1.

Will check this in when Jenkins says okay.., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
