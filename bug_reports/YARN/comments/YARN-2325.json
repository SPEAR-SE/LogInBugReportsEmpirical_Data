This message is automatically generated., Hi [~zxu], could you explain the case when nodeUpdate is called after removeNode? IIUC, RMNodeImpl state machine assures that nodeUpdate is not called after removeNode without adding the node. In concrete, NodeRemovedSchedulerEvent arises only in ReconnectNodeTransition/DeactivateNodeTransition. 

* ReconnectNodeTransition assures that new node is added after the transition with same node id. 
* DeactivateNodeTransition assures that the nodes will be DECOMMISSIONED, and the node won't be updated.

If the transition you mentioned occurs, it might be bug of state-machine transition. Please correct me if I'm wrong., Hi Tsuyoshi OZAWA, thanks for your quick response to my patch.
I agree to your points above. If this transition occurs, it might be bug in the code. My patch is just to make sure we return early to avoid a NullPointerException for some unexpected code error which cause the node being removed.
I also find the current removeNode function did the same thing: check null pointer and return early.
    if (node == null) {
      return;
    }
If you think my patch is not needed for NPE prevention. I am ok to close this JIRA., Thank you for clarifying. We're discussing a similar topic on YARN-2025. Currently, we don't have conclusion. I think it's better to keep this issue opened until we decide the policy., Yes, it sounds good to me., \\
