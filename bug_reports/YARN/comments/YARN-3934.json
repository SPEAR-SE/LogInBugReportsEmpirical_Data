[As of now there are no checks for the size of ApplicationSubmissionContext while processing submitApplication in RM. I feel we can have a check for the size in RMAppManager for this. An upper check with the ZK's max size will be a good solution here. I will check whether we can get the object size from ZK here and will update., Are we sure this is because of the size of a single ASC and not the number of applications at all? The latter can be fixed by setting the max-completed-applications., This is due to a single ASC object size. You can repro this with RM starting with empty state. So it is different from YARN-2962. , Here's a first attempt at the fix.  We cannot know with certainty what ZK has set for jute.maxbuffer on the server side, so we have to make the assumption that it matches what is on the client side (in this case the RM).  I've setup the code to read the property as a system property which is how we normally specify it.  There may be a desire to standardize it into the YARN config later on, but I think that's outside the scope of fixing this.  Without the patch, the ZK connection is broken and retried by default *1000* times, so the RM doesn't go down for awhile and all applications are blocked from submission.  I think it's probably worth revisiting that default value as well, but I'd like some feedback from reviewers on that if we should open a separate JIRA there., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~mingma] can you have a look at the proposed patch and let me know if you feel it addresses your issue appropriately?, Thanks for the patch, [~cotedm].  Looking at the patch, it looks to me like it handles the state store side of things, but it doesn't do anything to address the RM side.  If the state store throws an exception because the app size is too big, the RM needs to know that it should reject the application rather than considering it a critical failure., Canceling patch until comments are addressed, [~templedf] feel free to take it over if you'd like.  I'm not going to have a chance to address this for the foreseeable future.]
