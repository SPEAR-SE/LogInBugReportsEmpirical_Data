[[~leftnoteasy] . Should we reinitialize queue again for capacity validation?

, Attaching conf used for capacity-scheduler.xml . On Serviceinit the queue is not failing but on reinitialize the same is failing. yarn-site added in YARN-3893, Analysis Detail:
# During {{CapacityScheduler#serviceInit}} the value of  {{labelManager.getClusterNodeLabelNames()}} will be empty.  While setting  {{ParentQueue#setChildQueues}} validation is not done for Node Label Capacity, Detailed analysis and root cause
# Capacity scheduler queue initialization happens Capacity#serviceInit
# RMNodeLabelsManager#addToCluserNodeLabels store is added in service start on recovery, Thanks [~bibinchundatt] for reporting and providing analysis.

During {{initScheduler}} call from *CapacityScheduler#serviceInit*, we will initialize the queues. In the same callflow, we also will validate the capacity of nodelabel against the queue capacity from {{ParentQueue#setChildQueues}}.
{code}
   // check label capacities
    for (String nodeLabel : labelManager.getClusterNodeLabelNames()) {
      float capacityByLabel = queueCapacities.getCapacity(nodeLabel);
      // check children's labels
      float sum = 0;
      for (CSQueue queue : childQueues) {
        sum += queue.getQueueCapacities().getCapacity(nodeLabel);
      }
      if ((capacityByLabel > 0 && Math.abs(1.0f - sum) > PRECISION)
          || (capacityByLabel == 0) && (sum > 0)) {
        throw new IllegalArgumentException("Illegal" + " capacity of "
            + sum + " for children of queue " + queueName
            + " for label=" + nodeLabel);
      }
    }
{code}

As per this code, if there is a mismatch in capacity for nodelabel against the queue capacity, it should through *IllegalArgumentException*. But this will not happen in a case where we configure a wrong capacity for label in cs xml, and restart RM.

*Issue:*
During {{CommonNodeLabelsManager#serviceStart}}, labels will re-populated from old mirror file. But {{initScheduler}} and above call flow will happen from *serviceInit* instead of *serviceStart*
This will make {{labelManager.getClusterNodeLabelNames()}} call as empty in above code. and desired exception wont be thrown.

IMO We can move the node label init and recovery to serviceInit rather than serviceStart. [~leftnoteasy], could you please pool in your thoughts., Hi [~bibinchundatt],
Are you using latest trunk? In latest trunk, node label related capacity checking for capacity scheduler is not related to node label manager initialization. Misconfiguration of node label capacity should fail CS., After read comment from [~sunilg], I know what's the problem. In ParentQueue.setChilQueues, using QueueCapacities.getExistingNodeLabels instead of labelManager.getClusterNodeLabels should be able to solve this problem.

Thoughts? [~sunilg], [~bibinchundatt].



, HI [~leftnoteasy]
Thank you for sharing your thoughts. 
+1 for using  QueueCapacities.getExistingNodeLabels. It will solve the problem., Hi [~leftnoteasy]
Thank you for sharing your thoughts.
Will upload the patch soon., Attached patch as per discussion.
Please review patch , [~sunilg] and [~leftnoteasy] Please review patch, \\

This message was automatically generated., Testcase failures are not due of this patch to my knowledge. Please check, Thanks [~bibinchundatt] working on the patch.

YARN-3909 YARN-3910 YARN-3918 are tracking failure tests, not related to this patch.

One minor comment on the test: could you move the test to TestQueueParsing? And please verify test fails without the change and passed with the change., Hi [~leftnoteasy] patch for review after handling comments
