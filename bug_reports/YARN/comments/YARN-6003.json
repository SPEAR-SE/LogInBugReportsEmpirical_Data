[Now I compile yarn-ui locally and debug@2.4.1 is used. Maybe now this issue is not a problem., Yes [~ajisakaa], debug@2.4.0 was faulty.

As mentioned in an external link "Run npm install --save-dev -E debug@2.3.3 && rm -rf node_modules && npm install will force usage of a known working version in your app". We will try this to freeze the version of debug to a known version.

cc/[~Sreenath] and [~leftnoteasy], It because npm uses semantic versioning (semver) rules and the dependencies are not locked. Semver relies on package developers to not making mistakes, and here we stumbled upon a package with a bug.
Best option to fix this issue would to move to yarn package manager instead of npm. It also comes with added advantages like faster build time & offline build support.
A patch for the same is under investigation.]
