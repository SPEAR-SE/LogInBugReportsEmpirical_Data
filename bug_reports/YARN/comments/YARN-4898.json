[Probably we can skip the RMNodeLabelsManager#updateResourceMappings when label not enabled, Do we need to assign NO_LABEL in case when labels are not enabled?, Couple of things observing from code is
# RMNodelableManager service is started even though node label is not configured. I am not sure why it was done.
# About the impact, not much major but we can optimize it so that AsyncDispatcher load can be reduced.
cc :/ [~leftnoteasy] [~Naganarasimha], Thanks [~rohithsharma] for raising this issue, 
Seems like we do not require most of the functionalities done by  {{RMNodelableManager}} when node labels are not enabled. So i will try to evaluate the impacts if the {{RMNodelableManager}} is set to null or have a overridden implementation which can avoid the redundant functionalities when the labels are disabled.
i would like to take this up if you have not already started., sure, please go ahead. Thanks]
