This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~brahmareddy] for delivering a patch here. Several quick feedback here: 
1. Why we are setting log level to INFO in the first case while setting ERROR for the second case? I think we should keep consistent here, probably ERROR is suitable for both cases.
2. This particular exception get thrown when decoding path from URL it contains, so we should put rsrc.getResource() and next.getResource() there instead of others you are putting now.
3. More informative words than just "Got exception parsing." - may be something like "Got exception in parsing URL of LocalResource: " + next.getResource()?, [~djp] thanks for taking a look into this issue..Updated the patch based on your comments..Kindly review!!, Thanks [~brahmareddy] for updating the patch!
v2 patch LGTM. +1 based on Jenkins' result., \\
