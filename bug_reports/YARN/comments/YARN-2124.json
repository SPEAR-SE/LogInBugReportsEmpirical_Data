[Attached a patch to solve this problem. Moved ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy.init(...) from RMActiveService.init() to SchedulerMonitor.serviceInit(...). SchedulerMonitor will be always added after Scheduler added, so that ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy will be initialized after SchedulerMonitor initialized.
Added a test to ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy to make sure no regression of in the future., And I just verified this error is not occurred in 2.4.0., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good overall.
Test case:  seems just starting RM with preemption enabled should be able to trigger the error? if that, we can simplify the test case and don't need those surrounding changes only for test purpose., [~jianhe],
Good catch, I'll try to see if RM.start can reproduce this problem, thanks for your comment! I'll address it later., Hi [~jianhe],
After thinking about this, I think we cannot simple use RM.start() to write tests. RM.start() will trigger NPE, but the NPE is happened in a separated thread, and will be caught by SchedulingMonitor.
{code}
        try {
          Thread.sleep(monitorInterval);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          LOG.info(getName() + " thread interrupted");
          break;
        }
{code}
I prefer use the existing patch, do you have any ideas?, I think we can move getRMActiveService from ResourceManager to MockRM at least, Uploaded patch addressed [~jianhe]'s suggestion, move getRMActiveService from ResourceManager to MockRM., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
