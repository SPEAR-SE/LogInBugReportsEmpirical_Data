[This is a question best asked on the [user@ mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User].  JIRA is for reporting bugs in the code and tracking new features and is not a user support channel.

mapreduce.jobhistory.done-dir is not a per-job property but rather a property used by the job history server.  Attempting to override this property in a job will have no effect.  There currently isn't a way to specify a per-job final destination for job history files.  This would require some additional support in the job history server as it would need a way to locate the corresponding job history files for a given job ID if they could be in arbitrary places for each job.]
