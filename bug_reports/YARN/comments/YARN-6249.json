[YARN-6215 was meant to fix this. Are we still seeing issues? , Yes. Still flaky in trunk. 2 out of 100 failed in my local test. Failed both on configuration MinSharePreemption and MinSharePreemptionWithDRF. The {{FSPreemptionThread}} didn't get the chance to run in both cases., I debugged this test and detected the root cause of the failure.
In the test, FsLeafQueues are initialized before {{scheduler.setClock(clock)}} is called in setup(). As a result, {{lastTimeAtMinShare}} in FsLeafQueue is initialized to the long value of current time(a big number), and it will compare to the time of {{ControlledClock}} which starts from 0.
In {{FsLeafQueue#minShareStarvation}} invoked in update()
{code}
    long now = scheduler.getClock().getTime();
    if (!starved) {
      // Record that the queue is not starved
      setLastTimeAtMinShare(now);
    }

    if (now - lastTimeAtMinShare < getMinSharePreemptionTimeout()) {
      // the queue is not starved for the preemption timeout
      starvation = Resources.clone(Resources.none());
    }
{code}
If {{starved}} is true here at the first time this method is called, this queue would never satisfy the min preemption timeout.
However I don't think it is a bug in the real world, because this issue is related to ControlledClock only used in test. 
, In the attached patch, I called update() explicitly between app1 is allocated and app2 is submitted, to ensure  {{minShareStarvation}} of root.preemptable.child-2 is refreshed.
[~yufeigu] [~kasha],  would you take a look at it? I ran 300 times of this case no failure, and 3 of 100 runs would failed without this patch. , Thank you, [~Tao Jie] for the debugging and the patch. It makes sense, however should not we take care of the updates in function sendEnoughNodeUpdatesToAssignFully after the node updates similar to YARN-6218?, [~Tao Jie], thanks for debugging this. Good catch. For your patch, adding an {{scheduler.update()}} after scheduling action is a good practice, which is in line with [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]'s change in YARN-6218, but a little bit indirect to the issue. Would it make sense to initialize control clock before set it to scheduler like this? 
{code}
    clock.setTime(SystemClock.getInstance().getTime());
    scheduler.setClock(clock);
{code}

, BTW, [~Tao Jie], you can take this JIRA if you want to., Thank you [~yufeigu] [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] for your reply!

Agree! It makes this test more close to the real world., Updated the patch for [~yufeigu]'s comments. And ran 200 times again without failure., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, Committed to trunk and branch-2.  Thanks [~Tao Jie] for woking on this. Thanks [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] for the review.
The not-apply issue is because the Hadoop QA kicked in after I committed into trunk. Seems like a yetus bug. Ignore it here.
