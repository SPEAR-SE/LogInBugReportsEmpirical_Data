This message is automatically generated., This patch only contains proto files change, which does not affect generated java code. I checked manually by generating cpp output from those proto files, and see that the generated cpp files has correct namespaces., Cancelling patch to provide same with --no-prefix, +1, I'll commit after jenkins is back.
