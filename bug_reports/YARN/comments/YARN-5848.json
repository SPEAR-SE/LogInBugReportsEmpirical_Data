[I'm raising this to a blocker, now that these cross domain files are making the nightly builds fail due to broken XML formatting., Thanks [~aw] for reporting this issue. [~sunilg] , could you help to check this issue? I saw two crossdomain.xml under ui2 project., Sure. I will check and update., Makes sense. There are two files and one in the {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-ui/public/crossdomain.xml}} is not used also. I removed this. Correct crossdomain.xml is available in src folder and this also has ASF header.

After this patch, this file will be available at {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-ui/src/main/webapp/public/crossdomain.xml}}, | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
