[The problem does not occur on trunk because trunk has the {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/proxy}} directory while branch-0.23 does not., I confirmed same exception on 0.23.7. Creating webapp/proxy directory resolves this problem.
Attatched fix and test for branch-0.23., Kenji,

Please assign tickets to yourselves if you are taking them up. You can do that by clicking on "Assign To Me" button in the top menu-bar.

Also, if you think the patch is ready, submit it by clicking on "Submit Patch". That way you can catch reviewers' attention., [~jlowe], I am curious why we didn't see this in previous versions of branch-0.23, for e.g. on your installs., By default it runs as part of the ResourceManager process, and our installs don't change that behavior.  As such we don't normally start it up as a separate process.  I only stumbled across this when verifying YARN-354., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I am fine with the patch. Will check it in to trunk and branch-2 also, for the sake of the test-case., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3671 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3671/])
