[Patch to fix the bug., Removed patch because [~zjshen] pointed out that the same issue is for ATS as well. I'll upload a patch to fix both., Patch to fix bug in RM and ATS, [~vvasudev], thanks for the patch. Some comments:

1. Initializers can contain more than one items.

2. And in the case of "if (!UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()) {", you should take care of isHadoopAuthFilterInitializer as well, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~vvasudev], thanks for the new patch! The logic of loading the simple auth filter seems to be still problematic:
{code}
    // if security is not enabled and the default filter initializer has not 
    // been set, set the initializer to include the
    // RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer which in turn will set up the simple
    // auth filter.

    String initializers = conf.get(filterInitializerConfKey);
    if (!UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()) {
      if (initializersClasses == null || initializersClasses.length == 0) {
        conf.set(filterInitializerConfKey,
          RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer.class.getName());
        conf.set(authTypeKey, "simple");
      } else if (initializers.equals(StaticUserWebFilter.class.getName())) {
        conf.set(filterInitializerConfKey,
          RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer.class.getName() + ","
              + initializers);
        conf.set(authTypeKey, "simple");
      }
    }
{code}

4 conditions need to be satisfied to load the kerberos+DT auth filter. Then, in the remaining cases, the simple auth filter should be loaded, right? Or there intentionally exist the cases neither Kerberos+DT nor simple auth filter is used? If it is the former scenario,
{code}
    if (!UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled()) {
{code}
The above code will causes that any break except that of condition 1 result in no auth filter at all.

And it still make the assumption that filter initializer can only be of auth and static user. However, initializersClasses can contain more than that (see YARN-2277).

For the simple auth filter case, it's good to always use RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer or the standard AuthenticationFilterInitializer. The current code will causes that AuthenticationFilterInitializer is used under some configuration setup while RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer is used under the others., Thanks for the feedback [~zjshen]. My thinking is that in secure mode, we should replace the AuthenticationFilterInitializer with the RMAuthenticationInitializer to add support for authentication using delegation tokens. In non-secure mode, the RMAuthenticationFilterInitializer and the AuthenticationFilterInitializer are the the same so there's no need for any replacement.

However, in non-secure mode, we should have a default filter in case none is specified(so that users can use the rm web services), hence the code block for non-secure mode., Make sense to me. I'll commit the patch., Committed to trunk and branch-2. Thanks, [~vvasudev], FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6071 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6071/])
