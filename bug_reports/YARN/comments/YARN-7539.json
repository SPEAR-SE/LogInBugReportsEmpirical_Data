Hmm. Interesting..  And you saw this was thrown after the job has finished? Do you know what happens after this... Is the history file generated? Does the application show failed status or something else? 
Also, is the NPE printed once or many times? Basically wondering if the timeline collector is retrying or something and keeps throwing this error., Hi [~vrushalic], yes, the job failed because container can not be allocated.  There are logs written locally to node manager's userlogs.  There was no logs generated in HDFS, and the error only show up once per failed job., This is dupe of YARN-6695. Closing it as duplicate]
