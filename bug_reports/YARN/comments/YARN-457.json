[Kenji, assigning this to you. In future, it will be great if you
 - put a comment that you are working on it
 - put a summary of what the patch does.
Thanks., After YARN-396, this bug moved to AllocateResponsePBImpl. Editing title., [~kj-ki], the correct way to fix this is to use {{initLocalNewNodeReportList()}} also in {{setUpdatedNodes()}}. See how {{getAllocatedContainers()}} and {{setAllocatedContainers()}} are implemented for example., Sorry. I changed to call initLocalNewNodeReportList() before clearing this.updatedNodes., Comments:
I think if the updatedNodes == null, just simply do return. if updatedNodes is not null, then do initialization and add updatedNodes.
What this patch shows, if updatedNodes(input) is null, simply do the initialization, then delete all of the updatedNodes which are added in the initialization. I do not think this is the right way to do the setter, Removed this.updatedNodes.clear() to just only return if updatedNodes == null.
Is this correct?
allocate() in ApplicationMasterService calls setUpdatedNodes,
but it seems not to be set to null. Hmm..., First of all, I think the changes will be AllocationResponsePBImpl, there is no AMResponsePBImpl anymore. Could you update to the lastest trunk version, please ?
I think we need to change the whole setUpdatedNodes function definition, Only changing the if block is not enough. The whole change may like this way:
if(updatedNodes == null) {
   return
}
initLocalNewNodeReportList();
this.updatedNodes.add(updatedNodes);

The way we implement the setUpdatedNodes is just like we are implementing the setAllocatedContainers() in AllocationResponsePBImpl

, Also need add this.updatedNodes.clear() before we actually add all the updatedNodes, Attached a patch for trunk. Thank you., +1, Looks good, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
