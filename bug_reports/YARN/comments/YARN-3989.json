[hi [~bibinchundatt] & [~sunilg],
Is the purpose of this jira to remove the stack trace and show only the exception message ? If so i think multiple places for multiple commands we need to be handle and just for RMAdminCLI and NodeLabel commands
And also sometimes it might become difficult for developers to look into the issue and resolve it if the stacktrace is removed, i think we should have some flexible way as in case of operations too verbose will not be intended but in case of development it will be helpfull. Thoughts ?, Hi [~Naganarasimha Garla]
Thank you for sharing comments. I also do not feel like changing whole commands and suppress the exception across, that is not the intention. For few commands like "-aadToClusterNodeLabels", we need to see only suppressed messages which indicates a failure in addition. I agree in other complex commands, we may need traces. So we can selectively take the commands in rmadmin and give meaningful messages while suppressing exception. As mentioned in jira itself, it was trying to focus on nodelabel commands for now. [~bibinchundatt] thoughts?, [~sunilg] and [~Naganarasimha]

Currently only NodeLabel i would like to put in scope for this Jira.Other commands makes it more complicated. 
Few commands as [~sunilg]  pointed out.

# addToCluserNodeLabels
# removeFromClusterNodeLabels
# replaceLabelsOnNode

Its a huge stack trace which is shown in console and from trace it becomes very difficult to get the actual error message.Most of the cases only direct messages are intended for users not full stack trace.

So as of now will define scope only to Nodelabel commands in this jira.]
