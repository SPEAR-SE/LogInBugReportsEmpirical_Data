[The first thing that we need to determine is what the credential provider path should be for the ssl credentials accessed through WebAppUtils. 

Is this for individual yarn applications that may require their own ssl configuration or for a set of static Yarn webapps that can have a single location for ssl-server.xml today.

Thoughts?, Patch introduces the use of Configuration.getPassword to enable the use of the credential provider API in lieu of clear text passwords - while maintaining backward compatibility., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Existing tests may cover backward compatibility.

This message is automatically generated., Hey [~vinodkv] - could I bother you for a quick review of this patch and commit as appropriate? Thanks!, When it is ready it will need to go to branch-2 as well as trunk., [~lmccay] thanks for the patch! Some general questions(since this is part of a larger effort) -
1. For the null case(where the WebAppUtils.getPassword() returns null), should we add a warning or an audit log that someone was trying to get a password that was null?
2. Will you update documentation in another ticket(just to let users know that they can use a CredentialProvider instead of using plain text)?

Other than that, it looks good to me., Missed one more question - are you taking care of changes to ssl-client.xml as well?, Hi [~vvasudev] - thanks for the review and the good questions:

bq. 1. For the null case(where the WebAppUtils.getPassword() returns null), should we add a warning or an audit log that someone was trying to get a password that was null?

There was no such log or audit record in that case before adding the additional check for an alias in credential provider - so I didn't add anything new for it. It probably would be a good idea to do so - I don't know that this change makes it any more necessary though. Your question raises an interesting point for the Configuration.getPassword implementation though. I think that it would make sense to log a failure to get a password if there is no provisioned alias and it is configured to not allow fallback to config. We don't currently do that - it will just return null. I think we should file a separate jira for that.

bq. 2. Will you update documentation in another ticket(just to let users know that they can use a CredentialProvider instead of using plain text)?

We could do that. There is a jira for adding credential provider api documentation already are you thinking that it needs to have YARN specific documentation as well?

bq. Missed one more question - are you taking care of changes to ssl-client.xml as well?

This is a good point. I will have to track down those usages as well and file separate jiras.


Are any of these questions/answers blockers for this patch?

Thanks again for the review!, Hi [~vvasudev] - if you are okay with follow up jiras for this patch for docs and ssl-client.xml can you commit this to trunk and branch-2?
Thanks!, [~lmccay] none of those should be a blocker. With regards to documentation, I was referring to pages like [this|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.4.1/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/EncryptedShuffle.html].

[~jianhe] can you please commit the patch?, First look, this seems to be a bug ? earlier the first parameter is "sslConf.get("ssl.server.truststore.location")", but now it's changed to passwd, 
{code}
.trustStore(getPassword(sslConf, WEB_APP_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY),
           sslConf.get(WEB_APP_TRUSTSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY),
{code}, Thanks for the review, Jian. I will take a look today!

, You are absolutely right. I will have a new patch shortly.
Thanks, again!, Attaching new patch to address the issue identified through [~jianhe]'s review. Thanks again, Jian!, Larry, Thanks for the update.  But.. seems to be a bug again? should be "getPassword(sslConf, WEB_APP_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY)" ?
{code}
sslConf.get(getPassword(sslConf, WEB_APP_KEYSTORE_PASSWORD_KEY))
{code}
The test is testing CredentialProvider and the newly added helper API. can you add a test for loadSslConfiguration method ? , You are right again.
I am fixing it now and enhancing the test as you suggest.
Apologies., Fixed issue found by [~jianhe] and added direct test of loadSslConfiguration. In order to test it, I had to add a new signature for loadSslConfiguration that accepts a Configuration instance for providing the provider.path configuration for the CredentialProvider API. I made this new signature public static as well - I figured it may make sense for some consumers to provider their own configuration. Let me know if you would rather it not be made public., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
