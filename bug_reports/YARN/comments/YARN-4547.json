[Hi [~rohithsharma]
In many of the caller side, we either loop through apps or trying to get the size. I think may be we could return an unmodified set/list here. , This change is handled along with YARN-4617. Closing it as Done, shouldn't it be duplicate instead of Done?, I am bit confused that when to use Duplicate, Done, Implemented OR any other non regularly usable states. Since YARN-4617 is different issue, and incorporated this fixed as part of yarn-4617 patch. So, I precisely chosen as Done. Any suggestions are honored. ]
