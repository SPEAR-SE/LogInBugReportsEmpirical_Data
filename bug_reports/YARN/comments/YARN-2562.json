[I think we should try to put the epoch towards the beginning of the string. And may be annotate it somehow. Thoughts, [~jianhe]/[~ozawa] ?, Thanks for reporting, Vinod. Do you mean the epoch information will be lost for epoch > 0 with old ConverterUtils before YARN-2515?, I meant that current ConverterUtils#toContainerId can parse the string you mentioned:

{code}
    ContainerId cid4 =
        ConverterUtils.toContainerId(
            "container_1410901177871_0001_01_000005_17");
    assertEquals(18691697672197L, cid4.getContainerId()); // it works well.
    assertEquals(5, cid4.getId()); // it works well.
{code}, Vinod, I got your point. I prefer t add annotation approach like "container_1410901177871_0001_01_000005_Epoch_17". I think it's human readable. 
, s/prefer t add annotation approach/prefer to use annotation approach/g, +1 for text making it clear what the values are, but please make it lower case for consistency, Thanks for your comment, Steve.

This message is automatically generated., patch looks good. thanks Tsuyoshi ! could you add brief comment in the toString method that the epoch will increase if RM restarts or fails over?, How about {{container_e17_1410901177871_0001_01_000005}}? A number at the end for me always pointed to the container-id. We also don't need to be verbose with "epoch". And we can still parse it in a backwards compatible fashion.

If nothing, my fourth preference is to have something like {{container_1410901177871_0001_01_000005_e17}}, the first three preferences are what I proposed above :P, Thanks for the comments and suggestion, Jian and Vinod.

[~jianhe] OK, I'll add the comment in a next patch.

[~vinodkv] I agree with changing the verbose prefix to "e". I think {{container_1410901177871_0001_01_000005_e17}} looks best way - it's human readable, easy to implement, and can be parsed with old ConverterUtil. I'll update a patch based on the approach., Updated a patch:

* Changed the format to have epoch like container_1410901177871_0001_01_000005_e17.

This message is automatically generated., [~jianhe] [~vinodkv] it's ready for review. Could you take a look, please?, bq. A number at the end for me always pointed to the container-id
I think this is a point. and logically, epochId precedes applicationId, [~ozawa], your opinion?, My concern at first was that AppMaster won't work with new RM because of the change of containerId's format. However, we can change it since the protocol between AM and RM is changed and old AppMaster won't work in any case. Then it's better to use the format Vinod mentioned at first.
