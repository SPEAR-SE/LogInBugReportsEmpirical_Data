[Fix the test code to wait until RMAppAttemptImpl gets to RMAppAttemptState.SCHEDULED state before having the nm heartbeat.

Another way to fix it is to change MockRM.submitApp to waitForState on RMAppAttempt. That might address other test cases that use MockRM.submitApp., [~mingma], thanks for working on this !

I recently saw some other similar test failure e.g. YARN-2483.  maybe this is what we should do.  could you also run all tests locally, in case we don't introduce regression failure? thx , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
