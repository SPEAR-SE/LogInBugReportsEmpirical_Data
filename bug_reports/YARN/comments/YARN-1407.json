This message is automatically generated.,  I think it will be fine for backwards compatibility since as you said we are reducing what it could return, so it atleast won't be any new unexpected values.   We should update the documentation:  http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceManagerRest.html#Cluster_Application_API. It might be best just to remove the hardcoded valid values and point to the YarnApplicationState for valid states. , Agree with [~tgraves], +1 after doc additions., Uploading a patch that fixes the test, updates the doc, and brings the change to the web app as well as the API.  A consequence of the last part is that we now omit the apps that are in the FINISHING state from the scheduler page, because this is not an existing YarnApplicationState.  I think this makes sense, because AFAICT apps that are in the FINISHING state have already been removed from the scheduler., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
