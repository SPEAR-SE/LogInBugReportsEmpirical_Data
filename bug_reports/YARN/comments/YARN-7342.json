[[~yufeigu], thanks for raising this. Can you get this in for 2.9.0 as this looks critical?, [~yufeigu], can you get to it this week as 2.9.0 release date is this Friday (3rd Nov)? If so, update the target version accordingly., Not familiar with WebUI part. I will have a look first. Do you think it is necessary for 2.9? You don't think it is blocker for 2.9, right?, [~yufeigu], thanks for your response. I agree that it's not really a blocker for 2.9.0 but will be good to have.]
