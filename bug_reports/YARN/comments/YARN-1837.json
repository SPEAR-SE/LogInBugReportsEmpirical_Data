{code}, This test is also failing for us., Timing issue.

In moveApplicationAcrossQueues(), the state of RMApp is checked. If it's still NEW or NEW_SAVING, an YarnException with null getCause() is thrown. In the test, getCause().getMessage() is called on this exception, so NPE.

The App state storing and state transition happens in different thread other than the testing thread. So we have change to run into this check with App still in state NEW or NEW_SAVING.

The InvalidStateTransitonException is misleading and has nothing to this NPE. Even when the test ended successfully, I still see this exception.

This message is automatically generated., [~zhiguohong], your patch works well on my local. Your patch LGTM, +1(non-binding).

[~sandyr], can you take a look, please?, Thanks [~zhiguohong] for the patch. I'll too will take a look today., I tried reproducing the failure today but I was not able to do that. So I was not able to test the patch., +1 for the patch. 

testMoveRejectedByScheduler fails on Windows., looks good to me, +1, One more observation is that move is allowed at submitted state? not sure that's expected or not.  Unrelevant  to this patch.

Checking this in.

, Committed to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.4.
