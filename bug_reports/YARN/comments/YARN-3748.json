, Can this remove some of the synchronization, since updates are atomic? Retaining both seems redundant..., Really apologize that I missed this JIRA before.

Discussed this issue with [~subru] / [~chris.douglas]. 

First we have already suppressed these findbugs warnings. And also, most of these volatiles are updated by single thread and could be read by multiple threads. So it is not necessary to use Atomic-.

In addition, child tasks of YARN-3091 solved a lot of locking related issues/enhancements. So I think this patch is not required, closing it now.

Thanks [~gliptak] for reporting and working on this issue and thanks [~busbey] for reviewing it.

Please let me know if you have any comments.
