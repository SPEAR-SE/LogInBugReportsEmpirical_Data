[The current design supports host network, bridge network and fixed-cidr.  The possible combinations of port allocations are:

| Network Type | Port allocation method | YARN resource tracking |
| host | Random port | No action, OS handles port allocation |
| host | Fixed port | YARN tracks ports assignment |
| bridge | Random port | No action, OS handles port allocation |
| bridge | Fixed port | YARN map and track ports assignment |
| cidr | Random port | No action, OS handles port allocation |
| cidr | Fixed port | YARN tracks ports assignment |

Where bridge means container has private network address but port is exposed to outside world on host network.
Where cidr means container is issued with IP from the same subnet as the host network.

Bridge with random port is likely an unsupported configuration due to late binding of port information by application and docker does not become aware of the port existence.  This feature requires tracking of port usage by containers, and mapping port redirection for bridged network., Is this duplicated by YARN-7079?, Yes, they do appear to be duplicates. Perhaps we can repurpose this ticket to focus on yarn-native-services integration with the port allocation feature, once YARN-7079 is completed.]
