[The "testing" user shows up in the LocalizerTokenIdentifier.  I suspect there's a way where we can create a local filesystem object while processing a localizer heartbeat.  I believe the heartbeat will have a current user of "testing" since that's the user of the token authenticating the localizer connection.  If we don't close all the filesystems for that UGI then we can end up leaking them, since each remote user is a different UGI even if they have the same username.
, Profiled several nodemanagers' heap dump in our clusters, not able to find the "testing" RawLocalFilesystem leaking by far. Close this as cannot reproduce?, Yeah, we can't find any other instances of this.  Will reopen if we see it again.]
