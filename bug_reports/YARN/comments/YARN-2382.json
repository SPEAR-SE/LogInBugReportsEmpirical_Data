[Hi, [~nishan], could u share more configuration info? I tried to replay this exception. thanks., Hi [~ywskycn] This issue came when RM is restarted while job is in progress.
What configuration you need can you please specify?, thanks, [~nishan], that's enough information., Interesting... sounds like AM's REGISTERED event get ignored/lost in RM during RM restart? But AM continue to report status to RM which just come back?, This is probably an RM restart phase 1 issues. With phase 2 work-preserving restart, this is probably no issue. close this. we can re-visit always. ]
