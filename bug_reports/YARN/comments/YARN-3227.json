[Is it only the Timeline delegation token that fails renewal or all the tokens?, Does HDFS token renew requires the kerberos authentication or just the token authentication? Timeline token requires kerberos authentication being passed first., We have encountered the issue too. In addition to renew token operation, publishing system metrics will fail if it is enabled to due to the expired TGT ticket.

Compared with WebHdfsFileSystem, timeline client doesn't do checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab before contacting the timeline server. In RM case, RM user login from the keytab at the beginning, and after 1 day, it may have been already been expired. Then, the operations invoked by RM use may not have the valid TGT ticket to pass Kerberos auth. So we need to add checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab for both entity/domain and token related operations., The fix for this problem is straightforward: before starting the connection with the timeline server, the client calls UserGroupInformation#checkTGTAndReloginFromKeytab relogin from the keytab if necessary. I made a patch with 2 lines change for the bug fix.

It's not easy to verify the problem via the unit test. Instead, I play a trick verify it locally. I shorten the ticket lifetime to 1min, and modify TimelineClientImpl#main to do login from keytab at the beginging, wait for 100s to do token renew, and 100s to put entity. I could reproduce the bug in this way. And after applying the fix, this bug is gone. I attached TimelineClientImpl#main as patch too for your reference. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, [~xgong], as a matter of future reference, please give the active participants a chance to continue dialog for a newly posted patch.  A +1 and commit from a non-active participant minutes after the +1 from HadooQA is considered impolite. , Hi Jon, sorry for being hurry about this bug as it's critical to us. Please feel free to reopen it if you have any concern about it., +1. Patch looks good. Is there no test to be checked in?, Yup, I didn't figure out a quick way to simulate the TGT ticket expiry in the unit test. If I missed something obvious, please let me know. We can definitely add one test case to cover the change.

On the other hand, to verify if the code change will work, I made a small change in TimelineClientImpl#main and changed my local krb5.conf to shorten the ticket lifetime. I could reproduce the problem and get rid of it by applying the fix., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #125 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/125/])
