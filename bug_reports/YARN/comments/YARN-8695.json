Does "container id container_1534394833079_0012_01_000006" appear earlier in the AM log?  This may simply be a case where the AM has already decided to forget about a container it used earlier to run a task, and complains when the RM informs the AM of the completion of that container.  If that is indeed what is happening then this bug should be moved to the MAPREDUCE project, as it would be a bug in the MapReduce AM code rather than YARN.
, [~jlowe] Have attached the total log., Here's the relevant portion of the log:

So it is similar to what I expected.  What happened here is the AM received an extra container from the RM, so it immediately discarded it.  When the RM later responded with a container released notification to confirm it, the AM had already forgotten about the container and logged that warning.  It is completely benign.

As to why the AM received an extra container, this is an inherent race in the AM-RM allocation protocol.  Just as the AM was updating an older request for containers the RM granted some of those older containers, resulting in more containers being returned than desired.  See YARN-110 and YARN-1902 for some discussions on that.]
