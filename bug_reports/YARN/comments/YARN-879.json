This message is automatically generated., Hi Junping, I don't see any running Test is using this modified part of code. Can you help me to find if any test uses this?, Hi Devaraj, I think there are three tests (in TestCapacityScheduler, TestFifoScheduler and TestResourceAllocation) call this piece of code in application.schedule(). Am I missing something?, Thanks Junping for the info. These tests are commented and not runnning. Anyway these changes are good to have, if these gets uncommented or some other new test uses this then it will be useful., Oh. I see it. Thanks Devaraj for kindly reminder. BTW, do you know when and why these tests are commented?, I am not sure Junping, why was this done. We can get some info from revision history., The history may not show this if tests are commented since YARN-1 (I only check TestFifoScheduler which belongs to this case). Anyway, we can fix these tests or remove them completely. It doesn't make sense to me that some test code are commented for a long time as it just confused people like us. :), The test must have been commented when we rewrote RM a long time back.

Can you please try uncommenting one or all of these tests and fix'em to make them work and thus illustrate how to use this class? Tx,, Sure. Vinod. I will try to make tests work. Thanks for sharing background here. :), In v2 patch, fix unit test in TestCapacityScheduler and TestResourceManager and illustrate how test/resourcemanager.Application works., It seems jenkins didn't trigger the test-patch. Cancel the patch and submit again. This issue seems to happen a lot recently. Can someone take a look at it?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Sorry for the late response here. 

Patch looks overall good to me except few minor comments.

1. In Application.java, can you move AppAddedSchedulerEvent handling to after submit of the application.

2. Correct the typo
// regeister an application

3. Can we use org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.NodeManager.heartbeat() instead of org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.TestResourceManager.nodeUpdate(NodeManager nm1) for giving heartbeat so that we can make use of the update event triggering from ResourceTrackerService.

4. Can you fix the above comment for TestCapacityScheduler.java also.
, Thanks [~devaraj.k] for review and comments!
1.2. Sure. Will update it soon.
3. Looks like resourcemanager here is not actually started, so no dispatcher service (and handler for SchedulerEvent) is running.
Can we bypass dispatcher here and go to scheduler to handle SchedulerEvent directly given we are testing scheduler logic and other tests already cover tests of different dispatchers? , Address the other comments from Devaraj.K in v4 patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., It is strange that v5 patch are built and passed tests well in local.
