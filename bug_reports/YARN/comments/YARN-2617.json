[[~hex108], thanks for reporting this issue !
- Took a look at the patch. For Apps at New/Init state, we still should not prematurely remove the containers from context. I think we should explicitly check if apps  are at FINISHING_CONTAINERS_WAIT/APPLICATION_RESOURCES_CLEANINGUP/FINISHED state. If they are, we are safe to remove the containers from context.
- Also, the following code
{code}
      if (!this.context.getApplications().containsKey(applicationId)) {
        context.getContainers().remove(containerId);
        continue;
      }
{code}
 needs to be moved inside the following check {{ if (containerStatus.getState().equals(ContainerState.COMPLETE))}}, so that if app is at one of the states mentioned above, we don't remove containers from the context until container reaches COMPLETE state. Does this make sense to you ?
- Could you add unit test for your change too ?, I just added you to the contributor list, thanks again for your contribution !, [~jianhe], thank you for the review!

My concern is that we will need to modify the code when we add a new state for ApplicationImpl. It will be OK if it is not a problem. BTW: is there any case that APP has containers but APP is not in RUNNING state?

OK. I will change it.

And I will add an unit test., Update the patch. Delete an unrelated line., Thanks for updating !
- {{containerStatuses.add(status);}} is moved after this check {{status.getContainerState() == ContainerState.COMPLETE}}. In some cases(e.g. NM decommission), I think we still need to send the completeContainers across so that RM knows this container completes.
- we may not need to change {{getNMContainerStatuses}}, as this method will be invoked only once on re-register. Iâ€™m afraid not sending the whole containers for recovery will hit some other race conditions., Update the patch. 

I am not sure whether I catch your point: send completed container one time even its corresponding Application is stopped then delete it from context.getContainers().  If so, we need modify corresponding test cases., bq. send completed container one time even its corresponding Application is stopped then delete it from context.getContainers()
yep, because if we gracefully decommission a node, we also need to notify RM that the containers running on this node completes.
btw. once you uploaded a patch, you can click the submit patch, which will trigger jenkins to run the corresponding unit tests., Get it. Thank you!, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
