[Thank you, [~abkshvn] for reporting this. It may be YARN-3933. Are you using fair scheduler?, [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] Thank you for your quick response. Yes the cluster uses the fair scheduler.
It seems like that might be the issue! I will mark this as duplicate., Hi, [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
I'm afraid this JIRA is not a duplicate of YARN-3933.
The primary cause of negative values is that metrics do not recover properly when NM restart.
*AllocatedContainers,ContainersLaunched,AllocatedGB,AvailableGB,AllocatedVCores,AvailableVCores* in metrics need to recover when NM restart.
This should be done in ContainerManagerImpl#recoverContainer.

The scenario could be reproduction by the following steps:
# Make sure YarnConfiguration.NM_RECOVERY_ENABLED=true,YarnConfiguration.NM_RECOVERY_SUPERVISED=true in NM
# Submit an application and keep running
# Restart NM
# Stop the application
# Now you get the negative values]
