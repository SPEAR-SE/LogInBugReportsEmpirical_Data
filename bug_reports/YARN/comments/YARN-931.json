[hm... the packages have been defined in both sub-projects, such that package-info in these packages are overlapping.

How about merging the packages by moving the classes from hadoop-yarn-api to hadoop-yarn-common, as RecordFactory, RecordFactoryProvider and Records sound not like tipical API stuff?

Otherwise, package-info of either hadoop-yarn-api or hadoop-yarn-common needs to be removed. Notice that org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api in hadoop-yarn-api has package-info, but that in hadoop-yarn-common doesn't., I suspect it could be unnecessary for some of these package-info classes and we may should remove it completely. 
Typically, package-info class is used to define a package level documentation or annotation. But cases like: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.factories.package-info, doesn't include any necessary info (only annotation for InterfaceAudience, but not used as the only class inside of package has its own annotation) so far.
