[That's expected behavior.  YARN has a configurable maximum number of jobs it will keep in memory and recover from the state store after a failure.  Once that limit is exceeded, you can find the applications that are no longer available from the resource manager in the application history server.  Is there some other issue other than the log about hitting the max number of jobs?  If not, I'll close this as not an issue., Thank you [~templedf] for your answer :) 

In fact, the problem is more complicated just after this message in the log, all the processing craches => That means the two jobs were running very slowly for long time ( more than 7 hours)  without incresming in the state, and several jobs was in waiting state => Just after killing the 2 running jobs, all the jobs started to run and ended very fastly. 

We had this issue several times before ( at least 1 time in every mounth )  thing that makes a lot of problems in our production envirenment !

Do you think that increasing maxCompletedAppsInStateStore will solve the problem ?
