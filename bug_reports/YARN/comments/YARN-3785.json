[Updating a patch for same, Thanks for working on this. [~sunilg].
Looks like that we have added a new subApps() method which accept Resource as parameter in MockRM, and re-write all other subApps() method by using this new subApps() method. 
But I did not see "vcores". I understand that with this patch in the future, if we want to support vcores, we have already support Resource as parameter. 
Could you re-name the ticket title a little bit ?, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thank you [~xgong]. I changed issue description accordingly.
Attaching a patch fixing whitespace errors. Also Test case failure seems unrelated. 
TestWorkPreservingRMRestart.testSchedulerRecovery is passing locally in my trunk., \\
