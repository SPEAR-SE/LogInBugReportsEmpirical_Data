[[~xinxianyin], IIUC when YARN-5175 is in place i think this issue should not occur. how about working on that instead of this ?, Thanks [~Naganarasimha]. YARN-5175 may solve this, but the solution hasn't come out. Can we keep it open and keep track on YARN-5175 and if the finalized solution of YARN-5175 can solve this then we close this?, Sure [~xinxianyin], i have linked both these jira's and if we are not dependent on the tokens given by user and as per the Vinod's comment * we simply always manage our own tokens for localization and log-aggregation for long-running applications / services* i think would be perfect solution ]
