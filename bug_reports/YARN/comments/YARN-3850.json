[After thinking about this I was wondering if ShuffleHandler had a similar issue, since it too is looking for places to read files.  It looks like it might not be affected in the same way, since it doesn't use LocalDirsHandlerService and just uses the underlying LocalDirAllocator.  I don't think the latter will auto-update the list of bad/good directories, since it doesn't appear to update unless something tries to write through it or the conf is updated.

I think it could be problematic in that the ShuffleHandler will likely continue to search disks that later go bad or fail to search disks that were bad/full on startup and later became good.  If we start persisting bad/full disks across NM restart then it seems likely a map task could deposit shuffle data on a disk the ShuffleHandler will fail to search with its stale view of the disks on startup.  What do you think?  Should be addressed as a separate JIRA if a problem, but I'm trying to think of other places in the NM where we would have a similar bug and only searching good dirs for reading rather than also checking the full disks., Yes this also looks like a problem. We should not use LocalDirAllocator for ShuffleHandler.
I will look for other areas where similar problem can happen and update if I find something., Yes this also looks like a problem. We should not use LocalDirAllocator for ShuffleHandler.
I will look for other areas where similar problem can happen and update if I find something., Shuffle Handler would only read data from disk. LocalDirAllocator does not check size at the time of reading. So while we may search disks which have gone bad(maybe not a big concern), we will not fail to search disks that were bad/full on startup and later became good.
getLocalPathToRead in LocalDirAllocator seems to be only checking permissions and existence(on call to confChanged)., Below also seems to be a problem.

This message was automatically generated., Raise a separate JIRA for this or fix it as part of this one ?, Thanks for the patch, Varun.  Looks good overall, but I think we need to also update ContainerLogsUtil.getContainerLogDirs so the NM will also serve up logs from full disks from its web interfaces.

bq. Raise a separate JIRA for this or fix it as part of this one ?
I'm OK with fixing it as part of this (could change ticket summary to "NM fails to read files from full disks" or something) or fixing it as a separate one, but that ticket would also be pretty critical to fix., bq. I think we need to also update ContainerLogsUtil.getContainerLogDirs so the NM will also serve up logs from full disks from its web interfaces.
Yeah thats correct.
I will work on both of these as part of this JIRA because I will have to otherwise raise 2 more JIRAs'., \\

, Hi [~jlowe] and [~varun_saxena], I find {{ContainerLogsUtils#getContainerLogFile}} may also have this problem, because {{getContainerLogFile}} calls {{dirsHandler.getLogPathToRead}}, which uses configuration {{YarnConfiguration.NM_LOG_DIRS}} in {{LocalDirAllocator}}. {{YarnConfiguration.NM_LOG_DIRS}} will only include good disks after {{LocalDirsHandlerService#updateDirsAfterTest}} is called. I created YARN-3925 to fix this issue.
It looks like ShuffleHandler doesn't have this problem because ShuffleHandler and LocalDirsHandlerService use different Configuration.
{{LocalDirsHandlerService.serviceInit}} will create a copy of original Configuration:
{code}
    // Clone the configuration as we may do modifications to dirs-list
    Configuration conf = new Configuration(config);
{code}
So ShuffleHandler will always use the original local dirs-list., The merge to 2.6.0 is straightforward., Pulled this into 2.6.1 after fixing a minor conflict in TestLogAggregation.java.

Ran compilation and TestLogAggregationService, TestContainerLogsPage before the push. Patch applied cleanly.]
