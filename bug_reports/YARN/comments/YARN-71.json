[Are we also looking to kill all running containers when either shutting down the NM or when bringing it back up after an unclean shutdown? , bq. Are we also looking to kill all running containers when either shutting down the NM or when bringing it back up after an unclean shutdown?
I'd like to keep that separate. That can only be done during shutdown., Actually, given that now we have the container.pid files, we should be to kill containers from the earlier NM instance too. Will file a separate jira to kill running containers both on an NM shutdown as well on startup ( for unclean shutdowns )., 1.Add clear function At NodeMananger to clear the dir when NM start to reboot

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patches Xuan. Couple of comments on the latest one (71-6.txt)

- The ResourceLocalizationService is already creating a FileContxt instance - that can be used.
- The rename/exception code is the same across the 3 top level dirs and can move into a function.
- The patch needs some formatting fixes (missing spaces after "+", "," etc)
- Haven't looked at the unit test yet, but I don't think it belongs in TestNodeStatusUpdater.

In terms of the approach of moving dirs and scheduling them for background deletion - this seems reasonable to me. Once concern I have though is that this could cause some load on the NMs after they're restarted (especially on systems with a large dist cache and disks). This effectively ends up affecting performance. Anyone else have thoughts on this ? Maybe background / inline deletion should be configurable ?, 1.Reuse the FileContxt instance
2.put rename/exception code into a new function.
3.create new test java file , testNodeManagerReboot.java, and add new test case, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Comments on the latest patch.

- timestamp can move out - so that the same ts is used across all local dirs.
- Instead of scheduling old files, then renaming the current files and scheduling additional deletes - this could change to just rename the current files, and schedule deletion once.
In the unit test
- There's a couple of races. One when asserting state as RUNNING since the events may not have been processed. Second when asserting file delete, since that's also a separate thread.
- Also, the test should verify the correct user being used for deletion; spy on the deletion service.
- Minor, Use Records instead of RecordFactory

Also, can you please mention how you've tested the patch., Some more comments:
 - In case of errors, can you say " need to be manually deleted" instead of just " need to be deleted"?
 - Please add tests to
    -- verify fileCache and NM_PRIVATE_DIR deletion
    -- verify deleteHistoricalLocalDirs by rebooting NM multiple times when a previous deletion was in progress, Canceling patch for addressing review comments.., Uploaded new patch:
1. move out the timestamps, so all local dirs will use the same timestamps.
2. Rewrite the rename and deletion block, create two new functions, renameLocalDir() to rename the dirs, deleteLocalDir() to delete dirs
3. change to unit test to cover:
   a: verify the correct user who is used by deletionService
   b. verify fileCache and NM_PRIVATE_DIR deletion
4. Use Records instead of RecordFatory, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Couple more comments. Hopefully the last set.
- "//queue deletions here, rather than NM init?" - this comment isn't required anymore.
- The log messages in the delete method should not suppress the exception (
LOG.warn("Failed to delete localDir: " + localDir, e) ; )
- There's a log message in the test which says "named nobody" - this likely needs to be user
- Bunch of System.out, and printStackTrace() which need to be removed
- ContainerManager.getContainerStatus does not imply much - ant state except non-final states will show up as RUNNING. What should be verified is the internal state of the Container - via container.getContainerState(). You'll need access to the nmcontext in the test to access this

When testing, did you try different users with the LCE ?, 1. remove the extra system.out and printStack
2. get containerState from container.getgetContainerState instead of getting containerStatus from containerManager, when I do the test, I manually create some folders under /usercache with different owner and proper permission to test if all those folders should be deleted when the nm got reboot., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
