[TestRMWebServicesApps and TestRMWebServicesNodes fail for the same reason, this is ready for review., found one more in TestHsWebServicesJobsQuery, Note that TestHSWebServicesJobQuery still fails due to MAPREDUCE-4569, +1. This looks good. Verified that the string "No enum constant" is indeed the problem when run on jdk7.

Checking this in., Realized the patch has gone stale from what I verified. Also we need to split the MR test-fix to a MAPREDUCE ticket. Will do this myself to save time on iterations.., Same patch as Thomas', but upmerged and with YARN-only changes., Vinod - what is status on this, do I need to do something here?, I filed MAPREDUCE-4716 for the mapreduce side.  I will upload new patches here shortly., trunk patch without mapreduce sides as that will be in MAPREDUCE-4716.  This is probably the same as Vinod's last patch, but I upmerged to latest and retested to be sure., Tx Thomas. I missed this one. Kicking Jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
