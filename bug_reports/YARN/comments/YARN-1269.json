[We need to configure root not to accept *. However, the following case will have some problem.

{code}
    <property>
        <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queue1.acl_submit_applications</name>
        <value>user1</value>
        <description>
            The ACL of who can submit jobs to the default queue.
        </description>
    </property>
    <property>
        <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queue2.acl_submit_applications</name>
        <value>user2</value>
        <description>
            The ACL of who can submit jobs to the default queue.
        </description>
    </property>
{code}

If we have the two queues, we definitely don't want to set the users of the root to be the union of the users of both queues. Otherwise, user1 and user2 have the the access to both queues.

Maybe we should not check the parent queue access if the parent queue is root?]
