[or take usage of existing config property "yarn.scheduler.include-port-in-node-name" when differentiating nodes., What are the affected versions?, Which*, I tried to reproduce the first case on version 2.5.2 and the bug it is still present. However, instead of host:port1 showing on Lost Nodes, I got host:port2. In the same fashion, I lost track of host:port1. The sum of Lost Nodes remains inconsistent., bq. But when we manager inactive nodes(RMContextImpl.inactiveNodes), we use only use host. Two nodes with same host but different port are thought to identical.

This has been fixed in 2.8 to use host:port to track inactive nodes. close this.]
