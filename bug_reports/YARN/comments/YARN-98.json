[Earlier this error was present. However now due to behavior change (from restart to resync) this is not reproducible.

[~bikassaha] I noticed this during nm restart. Once the containers are killed. their state is transitioned to ContainerState.EXITED_WITH_SUCCESS. Shouldn't this be ContainerState.EXITED_WITH_FAILURE?? , After yarn-495 fix this issue is not reproducible. Closing it as a duplicate.]
