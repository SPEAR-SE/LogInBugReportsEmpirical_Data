[A miniYARN cluster that was working just failed with an NPE. I think it could be network related -before I could file the JIRA I had to restart the network base station -it could be the network outage was causing an operation to fail. The null hypothesis is that I have broken some config.

Looking at the code -this is the YARN-117-021 version- the line in question is looking at the response from the previous query -one that could be null if it has never had a valid response before {{isStopped}} is set to true, to break out of the loop:
{code}
            //get next heartbeat interval from response
            nextHeartBeatInterval = response.getNextHeartBeatInterval();
            // See if the master-key has rolled over
{code}

maybe the combination of isStopped & null response is a special case in which bailing out faster is the right action, [~stevel@apache.org] Could you provide me more information that I can re-produce this error, such as which command you are running ?

I do not think this 
<code>
            //get next heartbeat interval from response
            nextHeartBeatInterval = response.getNextHeartBeatInterval();
</code>
will cause this issue.

Because at ResourceTrackerService, this is how the response will be initiated before it returns back
<code>
    NodeHeartbeatResponse nodeHeartBeatResponse = YarnServerBuilderUtils
        .newNodeHeartbeatResponse(lastNodeHeartbeatResponse.
            getResponseId() + 1, NodeAction.NORMAL, null, null, null, null,
            nextHeartBeatInterval);
</code>. The nextHeartBeatInterval will be set., Sorry for the previous comment. This one is much clearer.

{code}

.newNodeHeartbeatResponse(lastNodeHeartbeatResponse.
getResponseId() + 1, NodeAction.NORMAL, null, null, null, null,
nextHeartBeatInterval);
{code}
The nextHeartBeatInterval will be set., I was just running a test which used a MiniYARN cluster; it showed this NPE in the stack when running a test case while the network was playing up. I haven't seen it since that single incident

Is there a codepath that could lead to this NPE-ing condition if some previous operation failed, with timeout or IOException?, I run several test which used a miniYarn cluster, such as testAMRMClient, testNMClient. But I did not see that., [~stevel@apache.org], I am closing this as invalid for now. The code has changed a lot and it isn't apparent what was causing it.

Please feel free to reopen it when you run into it again. Thanks!]
