[Adding patch, [~johang], Thanks for reporting this... I don't think the patch has been successfully uploaded though. Kindly re-attach., Sorry, I re-uploaded it and I think it should be visible now, The patch looks reasonable. Could you comment on your queue setup (depth, average breadth etc.) for the 96,000 queues that you tested this on? Just curious. , +1 pending jenkins, Basically its a tree as follows ranging from 1 to 16000. For each user group there is one general queue and one with weight divided sub queues.

root
  - 1
  - q1
       - veryhigh
       - high
       - default
       - low
       - verylow
, As I done seem to be able to edit the above comment and the tree ended up weird I'll repast it below

root:
    1
    q1:
         veryhigh
         high
         default
         low
         verylow
, Please let me know if there is anything I can do to continue the process of merging this, Looking into it. , Thanks again for working on this, Johan. Took a closer look at the patch and have the following comments:
# A few lines are longer than 80 characters.
# For the method parameters, {{recomputeSteadyShares}} might be more descriptive thaan {{recalculate}}
# While at it, I would suggest the following improvements in synchronization as well:
## In getQueue, some of the code could be outside the synchronized block
{code}
    name = ensureRootPrefix(name);
    FSQueue queue;
    synchronized (queues) {
      queue = queues.get(name);
      if (queue == null && create) {
        // if the queue doesn't exist,create it and return
        queue = createQueue(name, queueType);
      } else {
        recalculate = false;
      }
    }

    if (recalculate) {
      rootQueue.recomputeSteadyShares();
    }
    return queue;
{code}
## In updateAllocationConfiguration, club the two synchronized blocks into one, and recomputeSteadyShares outside the synchronized block.

Since we are changing some of the locking that would be hard to unit-tests, would appreciate if you could run the updated patch through the tests you previously reported. , Thanks for the feedback Karthik, I'll try to have a fixed patch ready by next week., I fixed the patch according to the feedback from [~kasha].
I also tested it in our test env and check compatibility of the following unit tests.
