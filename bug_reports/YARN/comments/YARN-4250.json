This message was automatically generated., Hi [~brahmareddy]

Thanks for reporting this. 

In {{ApplicationMasterService#allocate}} null labels are getting changed to NO_LABEL  so label should be null in requests after the below.
{code}
        RMServerUtils.normalizeAndValidateRequests(ask,
            maximumCapacity, app.getQueue(),
            rScheduler, rmContext);
{code}

But to my understanding  fix should be in {{TestAMRMClientOnRMRestart#allocate}}

{code}
      List<ResourceRequest> askCopy = new ArrayList<ResourceRequest>();
      for (ResourceRequest req : ask) {
        ResourceRequest reqCopy =
            ResourceRequest.newInstance(req.getPriority(),
                req.getResourceName(), req.getCapability(),
                req.getNumContainers(), req.getRelaxLocality());
        askCopy.add(reqCopy);
      }
{code}

When reqCopy is created the label expression is not copied

{code}
        ResourceRequest reqCopy =
            ResourceRequest.newInstance(req.getPriority(),
                req.getResourceName(), req.getCapability(),
                req.getNumContainers(), req.getRelaxLocality(),req.getNodeLabelExpression());
{code}

Could you please check again with above., Small correction in comment.
In {{ApplicationMasterService#allocate}} null labels are getting changed to NO_LABEL so label *should not be null* in requests after the below.


Also if you agree please change defect description too., [~bibinchundatt] Thanks for taking a look into this..When reqCopy is created the label expression is not copied, that's correct.After YARN-4140, we need add  {{req.getNodeLabelExpression()}} for {{resourcerequest}}.

Actually {{TestAMRMClientOnRMRestart}} and {{TestRMContainerAllocator}} both are failing,hence I fixed like that..May be I will raise seperate issue for {{TestRMContainerAllocator}} and add {{req.getNodeLabelExpression()}}.

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for looking at this [~bibinchundatt]/[~brahmareddy].

I think we need to fix AppSchedulingInfo side, consider null node-label-expression at {{isRequestLabelChanged}}. I thought ApplicationMasterService normalizes expression, but it cannot avoid a customized scheduler copy and modify resource request before inserting to AppSchedulingInfo. [~bibinchundatt] you are right :).

Comment on the patch is:
- Update {{isRequestLabelChanged}
- Revert changes of {{TestAMRMClientOnRMRestart}}

Thoughts?, Yes [~leftnoteasy].  I also looked this part,  and +1 for the approach suggested by Wangda. We need the change in AppSchedulingInfo. , [~leftnoteasy] and [~sunilg] thanks for your comments...I too agree change in {{AppSchedulingInfo#isRequestLabelChanged}}.can you please look at first patch ( i.e YARN-4250.patch)., Hi [~brahmareddy]

The check done is incomplete in YARN-4250.patch

{code}
+    return ((null != requestOneLabelExp) && !(requestOneLabelExp
+        .equals(requestTwoLabelExp)))
+        || ((null == requestOneLabelExp) && (null != requestTwoLabelExp));
{code}

The check should be like above., [~brahmareddy] can you update the patch?, hmm.. Uploaded the patch..thanks [~bibinchundatt] and others., \\

This message was automatically generated., Marking it as blocker since pre-commit builds are keep on failing..can somebody look into this..? , The conditions are bit complex at least to me. Can it be more simpler and readable?, Rohith i feel its fine., Hi Bibin, 
At first look, I also feel  it's slightly confusing what we try to achieve here. On a closer analysis,  this does handle all cases. So you could try give a detailed comment about the cases which is handled by this truth expression. , Updating patch for the same since precommit build is failing.

[~rohithsharma]/[~sunilg] On second thoughts yea its confusing. So have attached patch with comments and splitting check too.
