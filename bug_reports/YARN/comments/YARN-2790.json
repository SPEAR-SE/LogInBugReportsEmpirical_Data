This message is automatically generated., +1. Tested end-to-end on real cluster. Old error goes away and log aggregation does succeed., The patch looks good to me, but I may have found issues with the earlier patch at YARN-2704.
 - Once NMs gets new tokens from RM, it will keep on logging info about them for every localization and log-agregation for that app.
 - Seems like the system-credentials are never deleted even if the app finishes!

If you agree that these are issues, we can fix them either here or separately., bq. it will keep on logging info about them for every localization and log-agregation for that app
localization happens only once for each container and log-agregation happens only at the end of the regular app (or on log rolling interval). the sole reason is for easier debugging, I can change them to debug if you think it's an issue.

Do you mean remove from RM ? DelegationTokenRenewer#removeApplicationFromRenewal does that., bq. localization happens only once for each container and log-agregation happens only at the end of the regular app (or on log rolling interval). the sole reason is for easier debugging, I can change them to debug if you think it's an issue.
Say by default, after the 7th day, for every app, for every localization and log-aggregation, we print the log message about new system-credentials, right?

I missed that. Tx, we are good here., created YARN-2794 for fixing the logs., Thank you. +1, checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.6. Thanks Jian!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6422 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6422/])
