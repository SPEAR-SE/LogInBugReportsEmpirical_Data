[[~shurong.mai] It would be better if you can give at least some information abut the issue. Just creating an issue does not give any idea about it. I hope you created JIRA with some intention, probably you can your analysis too. For the issues like hanged, it is good that if you would have taken thread dump report., Sorry, I had added my description of this issue when I created it, but was not submitted to jira by some problems. I would add description as soon as possible.]
