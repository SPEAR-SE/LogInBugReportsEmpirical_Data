This message is automatically generated., [~ajisakaa], thanks for taking this up. Even though formatting the code to 80 chars per line is a good thing, it is probably better to limit those formatting changes to the actual text being changed. We can create a separate JIRA just for the formatting., [~kkambatl], thanks for your comment! I'll split the patch., Attaching a patch except formatting., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Created YARN-1570 for formatting., [~kkambatl], would you please review the v2 patch?, Thanks Akira. Sorry for the delay in getting around to this. Patch looks mostly good. I would leave out the following two lines, as yarn rmadmin -failover isn't really supported currently. 
{code}
+                      [-failover [--forcefence] [--forceactive] <serviceId> <serviceId>]
...
+| -failover [--forcefence] [--forceactive] \<serviceId\> \<serviceId\> |
+| | Failover from the first service to the second. Unconditionally fence
+| | services if the --forcefence option is used. Try to failover to the target
+| | service even if it is not ready if the --forceactive option is used.
{code}, Thank you for the review, [~kkambatl]!
