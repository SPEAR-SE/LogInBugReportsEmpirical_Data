[Looks like we will have to remove this option from the mapred script, since we do not have blacklisting in the RM as of now., Since we have blacklisting via health check scripts in place, we should enable this option to print the correct list of blacklisted nodes. It currently says "getBlacklistedTrackers - Not implemented yet", I think part of the confusion here is the terminology.  The RM does not have "blacklisted" NMs, it has "unhealty" NMs.  The net effect is similar -- the RM will not schedule jobs on an unhealthy NM.  Maybe if the mapred option was -list-unhealthy-nms or -list-unhealthy-nodemanagers with deprecated support for -list-blacklisted-trackers as an alias to that?, Sounds good. This option will give us a handle to list the unhealthy nodes and also be backward compatible., Listing unhealthy nodes can be achieved now using the yarn command *yarn node -list -states UNHEALTHY*. I am closing it now, Please feel free to reopen if you disagree.]
