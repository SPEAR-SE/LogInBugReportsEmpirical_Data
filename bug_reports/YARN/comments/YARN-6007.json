[On debugging, we found the issue is due to Hadoop's dependency on Hbase version 1.1.3. The errors are related to HBASE-15322. The fix for the given error is in version 1.1.4.

On upgrading Hbase version to 1.1.4, the build fails with convergence errors. On adding few exclusions in the pom.xml file, the build is successful, and the unit test errors are resolved. I have attached a patch with the changes made., Thanks for reporting this [~Sonia]. YARN-5976 is currently in flight to upgrade HBASE to 1.2.4. , Following the update of hbase.version to 1.2.4 in YARN-5976 , the 21 test failures seen in Hadoop Yarn project were resolved. ]
