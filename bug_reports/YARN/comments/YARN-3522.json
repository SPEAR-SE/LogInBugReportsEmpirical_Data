This message was automatically generated., - I think YARN-3287 in some sense is incompatible, since it forces user to use doAs to create the timeLineClient which is not required before.  Is this ok ? 
 I suggest adding a code comment in TimeLineClient#createTimelineClient to say caller must use doAs to create the timeLineClient

- start and end event occurred in the same run() method ?
{code}
    if(timelineClient != null) {
      publishApplicationAttemptEvent(timelineClient, appAttemptID.toString(),
          DSEvent.DS_APP_ATTEMPT_START, domainId, appSubmitterUgi);
    }
{code}, bq. I suggest adding a code comment in TimeLineClient#createTimelineClient

Add a comment.

bq. tart and end event occurred in the same run() method ?

It's another bug. I fix it together here.

The test failure is fixed in the new patch. It seems that the checkstyle warning is not related., \\
