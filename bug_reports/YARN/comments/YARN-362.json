This message is automatically generated., Tried the patch locally, but it's not solving the problem for me.  I ran a MR job, went to the successful map attempts page, and I still get hits that are not found if searching via the browser's search-within-page function when searching for strings that are in the "title" attribute text of table entries., Thanks for the review Jason! I hadn't realized that I hadn't jsonified the attempts table. I'm doing so in this patch. I've also fixed the pollution of search results, along with some minor code improvements., The patch ported to trunk, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
