[/cc [~ywskycn], Looks like the issue is because the html template files are not on the classpath. Posting a fairly simple patch to fix that. , This isn't an issue on trunk. Trunk has the following:
{code}
function calculate_classpath
{
  hadoop_add_to_classpath_toolspath
  hadoop_debug "Injecting ${HADOOP_PREFIX}/share/hadoop/tools/sls/html into CLASSPATH"
  hadoop_add_classpath "${HADOOP_PREFIX}/share/hadoop/tools/sls/html"
}
{code}, It might make more sense to have all the changes in slsrun.sh, and have it similar to trunk. , +1 LGTM, Uploading same patch with a different name., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Classpath fix that is hard to write a test for. SLS failing to load webapp is indication enough.

Thanks for the review, Robert. I ll go ahead and commit this tomorrow if I don't hear any reservations., Just committed to branch-2. Thanks again for the review, Robert. , FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8872 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8872/])
