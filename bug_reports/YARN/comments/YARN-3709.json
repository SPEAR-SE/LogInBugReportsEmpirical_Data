[I don't think this is a bug. Once an application is ACCEPTED, you can click ApplicationMaster link to track the progress, before it starts to run, it shows like 

YarnApplicationState: ACCEPTED: waiting for AM container to be allocated, launched and register with RM. 
FinalStatus Reported by AM: 	Application has not completed yet.
Started: 	Mon Jun 15 20:16:16 -0700 2015
Elapsed: 	3mins, 21sec 

that gives you the information about the current status of the application, and how long the application has been waiting. That is useful, isn't it ?, No need to fix as its useful to show the link]
