[YARN-2578 will address item 2, which try to fix the RPC to set timeout 1 min.
For me, 3.b will be a good low risk fix.
Also 3.a will be a good optimization., Thanks Zhihai for the information. Yes, setting the RPC timeout at the hadoop common layer will address the issue. For other suggestions, they might be good to have even with RPC timeout. We can open separate jiras if necessary., YARN-2730 is to address 3.a.]
