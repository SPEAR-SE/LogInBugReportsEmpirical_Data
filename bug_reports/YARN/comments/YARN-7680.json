[Hey [~ajisakaa]!

I have been trying to fix or reproduce this on apache/trunk without any success.

In the code I have found 4 places where org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.monitor.ContainerMetrics#forContainer(org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.ContainerId, long, long) is referenced, and all of those are invoked only if the yarn.nodemanager.container-metrics.enable config is set to true.

Steps taken to reproduce:
 * Run a pseudo distributed hadoop cluster
 * {{run hadoop jar hadoop-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT/share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-3.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar pi 10 10}} to fire up some containers.

If yarn.nodemanager.container-metrics.enable config is set to false I have seen no signs of ContainerMetrics being registered whatsoever.

Additionally I have set an output file for {{nodemanager.sink.file.filename=nodemanager-metrics.out}} and greping any sign in there for ContainerMetrics with 
 {{tail -f nodemanager-metrics.out | grep -i ContainerMetrics}} 
 still without any luck.

Could you provide a way to reproduce this issue?]
