[Patch to have the proxy servlet fallback to the RM's webpage for the app if no tracking URL is available.

No unit test, but I manually tested both visiting the proxy URI before the app starts running and after an app crashed on startup.  In both cases the page was redirected to the RM's webpage for the app., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I agree that the null check can hit before the app starts where redirecting is useful.

But for crashing AMs: Shouldn't YARN-165 have already fixed the original tracking url to point to RM web age already in case of crashing AMs? I just checked the patch and seems so., Unfortunately YARN-165 only handled the case where the AM crashes after making it to the RUNNING state.  If the AM crashes before it registers with the RM then it doesn't apply.  A quick way to see this in action is either set {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts}} to some garbage string or run a wordcount job with {{mapreduce.jobtracker.split.metainfo.maxsize}} set to 1., +1. Verified this condition still exists and patch does redirect to the RM app webpage.
