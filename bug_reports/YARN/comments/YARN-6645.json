Thank you., hi  [~cheersyang] , i will upload the logs and patch later, Thank you!, add the error logs when creating symlink, hi, [~cheersyang], we backport the YARN-1503 to hadoop 2.8 in our clusters. for this exception, we create the nmPrivateDir in writeScriptToNMPrivateDir method like this, please feel free to give me some suggestion, Thank you!

 private File writeScriptToNMPrivateDir(String nmPrivateDir, String command)
      throws IOException {
    File file = new File(nmPrivateDir);
    if (!file.mkdirs()) {
      if (!file.exists()) {
        LOG.error("Failed to create nmPrivate dir " + file);
      }
    }

    File tmp = File.createTempFile("cmd_", "_tmp", new File(nmPrivateDir));
    Writer writer = new OutputStreamWriter(new FileOutputStream(tmp), "UTF-8");
    PrintWriter printWriter = new PrintWriter(writer);
    printWriter.print(command);
    printWriter.close();
    return tmp;
