[Talked to [~gsaha], and [~gsaha] mentioned he will help if get chance. :)

cc: [~sunilg], Just took a closer look: 

Since both of environment/launch command will be written to a shell script and intercepted by bash, we need to consider following chars should be escaped (add a \ before them)
{code:java}
` : execute a command
$ : reference to environment
\ : all other escapes
" : double quotes{code}
Reference:
