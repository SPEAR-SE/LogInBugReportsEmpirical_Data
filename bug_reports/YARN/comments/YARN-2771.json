DS is not a serious computation framework, the env var name change is transparent to the CLI user, hence it should not breaking anything., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Constant name changes. No need for test case., Just realized I've missed one suggestion from Vinod in the description. I think it makes sense to keep the old constants, and mark them deprecated. In addition. I altered the logic in the AM to accept both new and old evn vars., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

 - DISTRIBUTED_SHELL_SCRIPT_LEN -> DISTRIBUTED_SHELL_SCRIPT_SIZE
 - DISTRIBUTEDSHELLTIMELINEDOMAIN also should be deprecated.
 - If envs doesn't contain DISTRIBUTED_SHELL_SCRIPT_LOCATION or DISTRIBUTEDSHELLSCRIPTLOCATION, it will not throw the exception. That is not correct.]
