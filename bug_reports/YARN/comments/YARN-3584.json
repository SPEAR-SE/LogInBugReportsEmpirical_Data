Checkstyle is showing wrong warning i think. The lines starting at indent 10., thanks [~nijel] for the patch.  to make it more clear, could you flip below order ? append the "Diagnostics" first, then append "For more detailed output..."

{code}
    if (this.getTrackingUrl() != null) {
      diagnosticsBuilder.append("For more detailed output,").append(
        " check application tracking page: ").append(
        this.getTrackingUrl()).append(
        " Then, click on links to logs of each attempt.\n");
    }
    diagnosticsBuilder.append("Diagnostics: ").append(status.getDiagnostics())
        .append("Failing this attempt");
    return diagnosticsBuilder.toString();
{code}, Thanks [~jianhe]
Updated patch to fix the comment., committed to trunk and branch-2,  thanks [~nijel] !, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7762 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7762/])
