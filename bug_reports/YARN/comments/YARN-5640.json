[JIRA is used for tracking bugs and features against the Hadoop code base rather than general user support.  Please use the [Hadoop user mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User] for general support questions.

NoSuchMethodErrors are usually an indication of a jar conflict gone awry.  In this particular case the Hadoop class is expecting the URLEncodedUtils class to have a particular parse method that isn't there.  I suspect it is picking up a different version of that class than it was compiled against, and that other version is missing the expected parse method.  Please check the classpath to see where URLEncodedUtils and DelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler are coming from.

bq. Also I couldn't find the DelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler in the source code.

That class isn't in Hadoop 2.5.1 which is even more evidence there is some kind of accidental jar conflict here.  It was first added in 2.6.0 via HADOOP-10771.  If you are supposed to be running Hadoop 2.5.1 then you'll want to find out what jar is providing that DelegationTokenAuthenticationHandler class (and the class that requested it).
, Thanks [~jlowe]. I mailed to user mailing list but no response for couple of days even after pinging multiple times, hence logged as an issue here.]
