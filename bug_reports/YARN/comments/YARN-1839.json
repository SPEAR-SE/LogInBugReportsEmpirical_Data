[{code}
          // The node set here is used for differentiating whether the NMToken
          // has been issued for this node from the client's perspective. If
          // this is an AM container, the NMToken is issued only for RM and so
          // we should not update the node set.
          if (container.getId().getId() != 1) {
            nodeSet.add(container.getNodeId()); 
{code}
This piece of code is flawed. We cannot assume AM container Id always  equal to 1. If AM container Id doesn't equal to one and it's added into the node set, RM will think this NMToken has already been sent and won't sent for other normal containers which AM asks., Uploaded a patch:

- Removed the containerId != 1 check,  changed RMAppAttempt to clear the node set after AM container is allocated. 
- Changed some NMToken related debug level to info so as to make debug easier. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
