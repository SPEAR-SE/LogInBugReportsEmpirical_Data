There are no tests, because all of the changes are in a cmd script.  I tested manually by running the 2 commands on a Windows cluster., +1 for the patch.

Verified both commands manually on a Windows single-node cluster, worked as expected., I've committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.2.  Arpit, thank you for the review., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4641 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4641/])
