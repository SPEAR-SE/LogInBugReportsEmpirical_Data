Could you please limit lines to 80 chars?
Could you please also split out the functionality you are proposing to limit cpu shares and memory into another JIRA? And also for the user the container is run as.

This message is automatically generated., [~sidharta-s] Can you review this?, I believe this is a good change. Could you please add a unit test. I'm a +1 on the change after that., [~ashahab]  The change seems fine to me. I would recommend adding a unit test (like Ravi mentions above) and changing the docker image specified in the example to a more recent one ( I think there is a 2.6.0 image available ).

thanks., Given that we have deprecated DockerContainerExecutor, canceling this patch.
Do update if you feel this is a security fix pertaining to a released hadoop version., Agreed. I am closing this as "WON'T FIX" for now given YARN-5388. Please reopen this if you disagree. Thanks.]
