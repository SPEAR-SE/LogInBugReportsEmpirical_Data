[I have observed a similar issue inÂ YARN-8546. That was caused by two allocations both take room from a reserved container causing queue usage exceeds 100%. But that was when async scheduling enabled ("yarn.scheduler.capacity.schedule-asynchronously.enabled=true"), not in v2.7.3. Not sure if they are the same issue.]
