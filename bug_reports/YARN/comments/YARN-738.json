[looks like it is fixed for now.. please open if this occurs again., Just get the repro.

1. testShortCircuitRenewCancel uses InetAddress.getLocalHost(), which sometimes will return the localhost with the IP address on the network, not 127.0.0.1.

2. The test code then calls SecurityUtil.setTokenService which serialize the hostname and port. The IP address isn't serialized.

3. RMDelegationTokenIdentifier.getRmClient call NetUtils.createSocketAddr to reconstruct InetSocketAddress. NetUtils.createSocketAddr will choose 127.0.0.1 first., The patch fixes the test code to use NetUtils.createSocketAddr to create sockets from localhost/127.0.0.1., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
