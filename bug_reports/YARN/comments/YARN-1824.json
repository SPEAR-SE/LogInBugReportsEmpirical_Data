[This jira is to track YARN side changes for MAPREDUCE-4052., The patch creates two constants in ApplicationConstants for PARAMETER_EXPANSION and CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR as known that they are different between Windows and Linux. On container launch, these constants are substituted with the correct  syntax based on the OS the NM is running., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch is appliable but not compliable because changed some method signature which is used by MR, submit the full patch in MAPREDUCE-4052 to kick jenkins., # YARN-1565 relates to this a bit, as it proposes the RM actually serving up some of this information (e.g. lib path). 
# the env var expansion strategy is going to complicate the {{yarn.application.classpath}} value

{code}
  <property>
    <name>yarn.application.classpath</name>
    <value>
      /etc/hadoop/conf,/usr/lib/hadoop/*,/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/lib/*
    </value>
  </property>
  
{code}

What will change to -something like

{code}
  <property>
    <value>
      {{/etc/hadoop/conf,/usr/lib/hadoop/*}}{{/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/*}}{{/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/*}}
{{/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/lib/*}}{{,/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/*}}{{/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/lib/*}} {{,/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/*}}{{/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/lib/}}*
    </value>
{code}

If this is the case, whitespace between braces should be stripped so it's easier to lay out paths.

I'd also like to see, in the absence of YARN-1565, the ability to inject the value of {{yarn.application.classpath}} which the RM knows about. Because today the clients need to know it, and if you get it wrong you get meaningless errors that are v. hard to track down. 

FWIW, I think in Ant we just let apps use : or , as separators, and just sort it out, with some special handling for the {{C:/lib/java}} syntax.

, If I understand you correctly,  the following is read from xml file and will first be parsed and put into a in-memory map,
{code}
  <property>
    <name>yarn.application.classpath</name>
    <value>
      /etc/hadoop/conf,/usr/lib/hadoop/*,/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-yarn/lib/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/*,/usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/lib/*
    </value>
  </property>
{code}
  after that the constant <CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR> will be used to concatenate the paths as  following and sent across  to NM. NM will replace the <CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR> with its own separator.
{code}
 /etc/hadoop/conf<CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR>/usr/lib/hadoop/*<CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR>/usr/lib/hadoop/lib/*<CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR>/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/*<CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR>/usr/lib/hadoop-hdfs/lib/* .....
{code}
The curly brackets {{VAR}} is used as env expansion marker for indicating env variables., My main point was : client code should not have to know the value of {{yarn.application.classpath}} as it is something that YARN itself knows, and which a client can only get wrong

to quote the Distributed Shell client
{code}
   // At some point we should not be required to add 
    // the hadoop specific classpaths to the env. 
    // It should be provided out of the box. 
    // For now setting all required classpaths including
    // the classpath to "." for the application jar
{code}

If there was an env variable YARN_APPLICATION_LIB which you could use when setting up a classpath, most of the pain in setting up a yarn AM classpath would be avoided, Okay, started looking at the patch. Some comments:
 - This string is useful: {{"User has to use this for cross-platform practice i.e. submit an application from a Windows client to a Linux/Unix server or vice versa."}} Let's put this in the javadoc for 
    -- ApplicationConstants.PARAMETER_EXPANSION_LEFT and PARAMETER_EXPANSION_RIGHT separately
    -- DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_CROSS_ENV
 - YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH name is changed breaking compatibility. Let's not do that.
 - Modify jovadoc for DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH to say that this won't work cross-platform and refer to DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_CROSS_ENV for cross-platform usage.
 - ApplicationMaster.java: You can't simply ignore failures with the rename of the script to be .bat/.sh
 - Also modify javadoc of Environment.$() and $$() to talk about cross-platform usage., Also call DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_CROSS_ENV to be DEFAULT_YARN_CROSS_PLATFORM_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH ?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5336 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5336/])
