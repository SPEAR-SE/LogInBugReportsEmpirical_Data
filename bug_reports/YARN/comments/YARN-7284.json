[Turning off DEBUG for ContainerLocalizer should avoid this problem.

But presumably it was turned on to debug some issues with localization.

It's high time we send the ContainerLocalizer output also to a file that eventually gets aggregated. The key challenge is that ContainerLocalizer isn't tied to one container - it can download resources for multiple containers. So, tying to log-aggregation will need some non-trivial tricks.]
