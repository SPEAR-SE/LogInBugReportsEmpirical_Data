[Because NM and RM both are the trusted components in the system, I think we should do this validation on the NM itself.

This message is automatically generated., I just realized that YARN-576 added code to reject NMs which report with resources less than min-resource configuration on RM. This automatically covers negative values too. It had to be done on RM side itself as the config can potentially be refreshed only on RM.
