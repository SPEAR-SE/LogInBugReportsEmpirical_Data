[A patch to fix this issue., Thanks the picking this up, Harshit.  It seems like it would be difficult to write unit tests for this, so I'm ok with not including them.  Can you mention the steps you've taken to manually test the patch?

As the added code is very similar for both schedulers, are we able to share it in a central location? We could create a SchedulerPageUtil.

Can we change the names of addRemoveQueueToQuery and the other function names to make it clear that they're related to expand / unexpand?

A few stylistic comments:
* Lines should be broken up so that they fit within close to 80 characters.
* There should be a space between "if" and "for" and the corresponding open parentheses.
* There should be spaces between the operators and operands in conditions, e.g (a == b), not (a==b)
* There should be spaces after the semicolons in for loops.
* There should be spaces in between "else" and the surrounding curly braces.
* Closing curly braces should line up vertically with the beginning of the statement like so:
{code}
if (condition) {
  dostuff;
}
not
if (condition) {
  dostuff; }

This message is automatically generated., 1. Sandy logic is same for both the schedulers , will add a new class as you suggested to prevent code duplication.

One question can't we put this in some already existing common class ? If you know let me know else will try to find, if not able to get any class with such common usage then will go on with adding SchedulerPageUtil class.
  
With respect to coding pattern will do the changes and update the patch.

2. Steps taken to manually verify patch
       1. Tested the patch on my machine with queues and sub queues 
        example : 
        a. root -> [root.queue1 and root.queue2]
        b. root->[ root.queue1->[root.queue1.queuea , root.queue1.queueb] and root.queue2]

       Test Cases
        i. First time page is loading properly : success.
        ii. Open (Expand) a queue and reload the page , the queue that was opened earlier should be open after page is reloaded : success.
        iii. Expand (Open) and Unexpand (Close) few queue's and reload the page again, the queue which were unexpanded before page reload should be unexpanded even after reload and the one which were in expanded state should be in expanded state ie. page should look the same even after reload with respect to queues open/close state. : success.

        Tested in chrome (version 30.0.1599.101), Safari(Version 6.1 (7537.71)) and Firefox(version 20.0)
        System : Mac OS X (version 10.7.5)

3. For "The patch appears to cause the build to fail." 
I added my patch to checked out trunk using patch -p0 < YARN-584-branch-2.2.0.patch ( at root folder )
and then build it using  mvn install -DskipTests  and I got a  BUILD SUCCESS can you why log is showing build fail ?
, bq. One question can't we put this in some already existing common class ? If you know let me know else will try to find, if not able to get any class with such common usage then will go on with adding SchedulerPageUtil class.
I looked and couldn't find an existing class where this would fit well.  I think adding a new one is fine.

bq. I added my patch to checked out trunk using patch -p0 < YARN-584-branch-2.2.0.patch ( at root folder )
How up to date is the version of trunk you checked out?, I applied the patch and tested it as well and it appears to work well.  One thing I noticed - if I expand a parent queue and subqueue, and then close the parent queue, but not the subqueue, they both appear as open when I refresh the page.  Would this be difficult to fix?, Updating patch.
Applied and tested on hadoop-trunk (Checked out revision 1540489) and got build success.

This message is automatically generated., While trying to fix another bug, found that if we expand the first queue under the root and reload the page queue is getting closed.

However if we expand any other queue under root, at any level and reload the page the,result is what we expect ie. the queues which were expanded earlier are expanded.

Fixing this last problem with updated patch.

This message is automatically generated., The patch is getting closer.  A few more comments:

I don't think we to place ExpandNode and StoreExpandedNode into their own inner class - we can put them directly in SchedulerPageUtil.  Also, maybe rename them to ExpandQueueNode and StoreExpandedQueueNode to make it clear what they deal with?

{code}
+    static class ExpandNode extends HtmlBlock{     
{code}
Some unnecessary trailing spaces on this line.

{code}
+public class SchedulerPageUtil{
{code}
A space is expected before the curly brace.  This applies to a few other places in the patch as well.

{code}
+      protected void render(Block html) {
+        html.
+		  script().$type("text/javascript").
+		  _("function reopenQueryNodes(){",
{code}
{code}
+	        "  });",
+	        "}")._();
+	  }
+      
+    }
{code}
Fix indentation.



, bq. Also, maybe rename them to ExpandQueueNode and StoreExpandedQueueNode to make it clear what they deal with?

Can you please suggest some other name as \\
- ExpandNode / reopenNodes  : means after render nodes which were earlier in expanded state will be expanded again.
- StoreExpandedQueueNode : means whenever user is opening a node store that node ( in this case as url param ), for later usage ie. when page is reloaded.

bq. I don't think we to place ExpandNode and StoreExpandedNode into their own inner class - we can put them directly in SchedulerPageUtil. 
Removed the inner class and made them as methods. \\

1. Added space before open curly brace where ever it is present. \\
2. Indented the code the way you asked and using already present class as reference. \\

{{Will upload the updated patch once we finalize the method name}}. , Thanks for making these changes.

The nodes in "ExpandNode" and "StoreExpandedNode" correspond to scheduler queues, right?  My suggestion was to add "Queue" to the names to make this correspondence more explicit.  Am I misunderstanding?, Updated patch with
- indentation and spacing after brackets using already present class as reference. 
- renaming of methods / inner class name, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
