This message was automatically generated., Thanks for reporting and working on this, Arun. The approach looks good to me. Few minor comments on the patch:
# Can we call the config and variables {{reservableNodes}}? Calling it {{appReservationThreshold}} increases the ambiguity with SLA-reservations. 
# In {{FairScheduler#removeNode}}, can we log an error in the else block. i.e., when a rack is not found in the app or has a node-count <=0? 
# FSAppAttempt: can we add a comment to describe what the map holds? i.e., what String corresponds to? 
{code}
  private Map<String, Set<String>> reservations = new HashMap<>();
{code}
# Should we use a smaller value for the default? Consider a cluster with 2k nodes: with this default, we end up reserving on 1000 nodes. How about using 0.05?
# I believe we should be reserving nodes for an app only after the locality of the corresponding RR is fully relaxed. That is likely for another JIRA. 
# Nit: Spurious changes in FairSchedulerConfiguration, Added comment too soon. Couple of comments:
# FSAppAttempt#reservationExceedsThreshold: Instead of doing a ratio, would it be better to check {{existingReservations > Math.ceil(reservableNodes() * totalAvailableNodes)}}? We avoid a division and the check to see if there is at least one reservation is not necessary. 
# Nice tests. , Thanks for the review [~kasha] !!

Updating patch with your suggestions. Will file a follow up for delaying reservations until locality relaxation has maxed out., \\
