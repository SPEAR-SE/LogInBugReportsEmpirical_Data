This message is automatically generated., Regarding the LocalLogs link, the problem is on webapp.Dispatcher, if the request uri comes as '/static/', '/logs/' or '/cluster' which all return the pathInfo as '/'. In case of '/', the RM webApp router just routes it to the main page.

Made the change that only apply GuiceFilter to '/cluster/*', '/node/*', '/jobhistory/*' and '/'

The metrics link has not been fixed, which is also not working on HDFS site though., upload a patch to fix the local logs link, I haven't looked at this in detail but you can't  remove the /logs from the HttpServer.java as that is used by hdfs, unless that was changed in another jira?

Also you need to make sure the logs can only be accessed by admins - the HttpServer code used to go through the AdminAuthorizedServlet.

Some of the default servlets do work, like /jmx, /logLevel, I would think the /metrics one could too, perhaps if we fix whatever is broken for both hdfs and yarn it will just work?   /logs is a bit different since its just a resource handler.  

I'm not totally against changing it from the previous behavior of showing everything in the directory as this is probably more secure but I don't see any discussion about that here?  It appears we are only showing the .log file, so we want to show the .out file also?, bq. I haven't looked at this in detail but you can't remove the /logs from the HttpServer.java as that is used by hdfs, unless that was changed in another jira?
Thomas, I think you made the same mistake as I. The first one was dead, you have to look at YARN-981.patch, which by the looks of it is still a WIP., sorry for the confusing, upload a same patch named as YARN-981.2.patch, ah sorry, thanks for clarifying., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

[ERROR] symbol  : method getWebAppContext()
[ERROR] location: class org.apache.hadoop.http.HttpServer
{code}, This patch also breaks web service, needs more fix., In fact, we have 3 contexts in HttpServer:
webAppContext: "/logs/" -> points to the log directory
staticContext:  "/static/" -> points to common static files (src/webapps/static)
logContext:  "/" -> the jsp server code from (src/webapps/<name>)

In YARN, we should only apply GuiceFilter to the webAppContext, To clarify: In YARN, we should apply GuiceFilter to ALL paths of webAppContext, upload a new patch to fix the Web Service issue, Reverted the original patch on branch-2.1 for fixing build failures., sorry, the previous mapping is wrong, should be this:
logContext: "/logs/" -> points to the log directory
staticContext: "/static/" -> points to common static files (src/webapps/static)
webAppContext: "/" -> the jsp server code from (src/webapps/<name>), New patch added a unit test, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
