[The nodemanager should be using the permission forms of DiskChecker.checkDir like the datanode does., Patch to change {{DirectoryCollection}} so it also takes the permissions for directories  and updating {{LocalDirsHandlerService}} to pass appropriate permissions., This will run into issues if users want to control the permission on their local / log dirs. The patch has these set to 0755 - which I think is ok if the dirs don't already exist. If they do exist however, I don't think we should be attempting to change the permissions. Alternately, maybe configure LOG/LOCAL dir permissions ? - which could also be used to ensure the dirs have the correct permissions. Would prefer not adding additional configs though., How will public files in the distributed cache work properly if the local directory doesn't have world access?  We're already locking down access to the directories within these top-level directories for files that aren't public, so even if they are left at 755 I'm not sure there is a real need to set them otherwise.  Maybe there's a valid use-case I'm missing?

I agree I'd rather avoid adding yet more configs, especially since it would be easy to configure a broken setup (e.g.: files put in the public cache but are inaccessible to many jobs or logs can't be served/aggregated by the nodemanager).
, Not the best example - but a single user setup does not need 0755 for the public cache. I don't think a non LCE cluster needs this either. 
If admins happen to have pre-created the dirs with specific permissions - I don't think we should try changing them
1) admins are aware of these directories since they've been explicitly configured. If they exist, they've likely been created with whatever permissions are required for the cluster.
2) the YARN user may not have privileges to change permission (may still be able to write to the dir) - in which case the dir is marked as unusable.
, OK I'm convinced, thanks for the clarification.  Attaching a new patch where it will create missing local/log directories as mode 0755 but will leave existing directories untouched., Thanks for updating the patch. Looks good except for one minor fix. After attempting to create the dirs in LocalDirsHandlerService, the dir set needs to be updated back into the configuration, especially in case of a failure. , Thanks for taking another look.  Normally the checkDirs() call right afterwards will encounter the same error and update the configuration's directory list, but I agree it should explicitly handle it just in case.  I updated the patch accordingly., Unless I'm missing something, the checkDirs() call after may not attempt to check these dirs since the directory creation failed, and they no longer exist in the {{localDirs}} collection.

The patch to add the explicit check looks good. +1. Need someone to kick jenkins before committing it., Yep, you're right, since we explicitly remove the directory checkDirs() won't handle it so we need to handle explicitly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Looks like the test failure is related., Failure was due to a bogus URI being used by TestContainerLogsPage that should have failed originally, but URIs in local/log dirs aren't handled properly.  See YARN-33.

Updated the TestContainerLogsPage to fix the URI so it points to a path that can be created.  YARN-33 will handle cleaning up DirectoryCollection and/or LocalDirsHandlerService to deal with URIs in the local/log dir config., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
