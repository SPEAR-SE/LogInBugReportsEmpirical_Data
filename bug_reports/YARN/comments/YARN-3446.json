This message is automatically generated., It's not entirely clear this is the solution we want. Can we please hold this patch off while we figure out the right solution at YARN-1680?, Discussing the approach on YARN-1680. Let us finalize the approach there quickly, and make progress here. , [~zxu] - the patch doesn't apply any more. Could you please rebase it onto trunk? , Thanks [~kasha] for the reminder! I just uploaded a new patch YARN-3446.002.patch based on the latest code at trunk. Please review it., Thanks for rebasing the patch, [~zxu]. Comments:

FSAppAttempt:
# How about using a helper method {{subtractResourcesOnBlacklistedNodes}} instead of adding all the logic to {{getHeadroom}} itself?
# Is the optimization to get the blacklist only when it has changed necessary? Looks like we optimize the fetch, but not the iteration on it. I think we should either go all the way and optimize iterating on the blacklist nodes as well only when the blacklist has changed, or leave out the optimization until we see a need for it. 
# To get the blacklist, can't we just use {{AppSchedulingInfo#getBlacklist}} (needs synchronization) or {{AppSchedulingInfo#getBlacklistCopy}}? Do we need the methods in the scheduler? 

If we make these changes, we might not need all the changes in rest of the files.
, Hi [~kasha], Thanks for the review! I attached a new patch YARN-3446.003.patch, which addressed your first comment. I also added more test cases to verify {{getHeadroom}} with blacklisted nodes remove and addition.
About your second comment: IMHO, if we didn't do the optimization, that will be a very big overhead for a large cluster. For example, we have 2000 AM running on 5000 nodes cluster, For each AM, we need go through 5000 nodes list to find the blacklisted {{SchedulerNode}} in the heartbeat. With 2000 AM, it will loop 10,000,000 times. Normally number of blacklisted nodes should be very small for each application. So iterating on the blacklisted nodes may not be a performance issue. Also AM won't change blacklisted nodes frequently.
About your third comment, it is because currently {{SchedulerNode}} are stored in {{AbstractYarnScheduler#nodes}} with key {{NodeId}}. But {{AppSchedulingInfo}} stores the blacklisted nodes using {{String}} Node Name or Rack Name. I can't find an easy way to translate Node Name and Rack Name to {{NodeId}}. So it looks like we need iterate through {{AbstractYarnScheduler#nodes}} to find the blacklisted {{SchedulerNode}} if we use {{AppSchedulingInfo#getBlacklist}}. That means for a 5000 nodes cluster, we need loop 5000 times, a big overhead. {{AbstractYarnScheduler#nodes}} are defined at the following code:
{code}
  protected Map<NodeId, N> nodes = new ConcurrentHashMap<NodeId, N>();

, Patch looks good, but for one minor comment: can we rename {{AbstractYarnScheduler#getBlackListNodeIds}} to {{addBlacklisedNodeIdsToList}} to capture the behavior here of adding the nodeIds to the list that is passed. Also, given the method is used by all schedulers, we might want to add a javadoc briefly explaining what it does. 

, Thanks for the review [~kasha]! That is a good suggestion. I attached a new patch YARN-3446.005.patch, which addressed your comments. Please review it., +1, pending Jenkins. Will commit it if Jenkins says okay. , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
