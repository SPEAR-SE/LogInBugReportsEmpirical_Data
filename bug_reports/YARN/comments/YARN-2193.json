bq.  because some fields are missing in jhist file

[~ashutosh_jindal], would you please share what was missing in jhist file?, During applicationMaster start up, JobHistoryEventHandler initializes the writer.  This is one time initialization. If this fails because of NN problem, then none of the events are written. 

In this issue, because of NN safemode, writer is not initialized. Only Job_Finished event is written. At historyserver, it parse the jhist file. Job_Finished event does not contain all the fields. So, some of the field are missed.]
