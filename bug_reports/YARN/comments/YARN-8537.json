[Sorry, it seems  that branch-3.1.0 does not have the problem any more.

I discovered this problem in branch-2.7.3 after apply patch YARN-4090, YARN-7382.

Restart ResourceManager when there are jobs still running, and the first container that recovered for each job is not the am. And therefore queue's AMResourceUsage is not correct.

But I can not find this problem in branch-3.1.0, will close this as invalid. Sorry to disturb...]
