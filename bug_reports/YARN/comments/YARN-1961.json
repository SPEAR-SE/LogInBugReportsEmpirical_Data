[hey [~sandyr], Do you know the history behind why preemption is implemented only at a leaf queue level ?
Isn't this a bug ?
Just wanted to get some context. , Hey Ashwin,
The history is only that we haven't yet added support for that property in parent queues.  I agree that it would be a helpful thing to add., Configuring minResources and minshare preemption on non-leaf queues might not be desirable for the following reasons:
# Minshare preemption was often used in the past to address cases where users wanted to be able to trigger preemption when a queue is over half of its fairshare. Now that we have added fairsharePreemptionThreshold, this is less the case.
# Other usecase for minshare preemption was to give enough resources for a high priority job quickly (shorter minshare preemption timeout). Now, we support setting the fairsharePreemptionTimeout per queue. Also, while it might be easier to figure out resources need for an application, it is much harder to come up with absolute minimum resources required for any queue in general and a non-leaf queue in particular. 

[~ashwinshankar77] - if you agree this is less desirable, I would like to close this as "Won't Fix". , Sure, please feel to close this., s/feel/feel free, Closing this as "Won't Fix". Please reopen if there is a good reason to do this. ]
