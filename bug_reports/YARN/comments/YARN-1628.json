This message is automatically generated., +1.  Will check in later today.  Thanks!, Hang on, we cannot make this localhost. We deliberately made it InvalidHost as we want to test for wrong tokens. I have a patch which disables IP checks - this is what we've been doing elsewhere., Patch adding core-site.xml with IP checks disabled. This is similar to what we eventually did at MAPREDUCE-5261. The test failed before the patch and passes after it is applied., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1. applied against to trunk and test passed., I have some workaround. Will get back with what I get on it., @mitdesai, what work-around? The attached patch should fix it, taking this over. I'll ask another committer to look for review/commit. Thanks., +1. The patch should fix the failure. Will commit it.

Did some more investigation. In SecurityUtil,
{code}
  static {
    Configuration conf = new Configuration();
    boolean useIp = conf.getBoolean(
        CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_TOKEN_SERVICE_USE_IP,
        CommonConfigurationKeys.HADOOP_SECURITY_TOKEN_SERVICE_USE_IP_DEFAULT);
    setTokenServiceUseIp(useIp);
  }
{code}
Getting "useIp" from a newly constructed Configuration prevents us from programmatically adding/editing HADOOP_SECURITY_TOKEN_SERVICE_USE_IP. This is why we cannot simply change conf in TestContainerManagerSecurity to fix the problem. Anyway, let's think about it separately.
