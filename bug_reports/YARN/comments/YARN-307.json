[For example I am seeing container launch failure without any useful message like this.
{noformat}
2013-01-03 00:33:49,045 DEBUG org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeStatusUpdaterImpl: Node's health-status : true,

2013-01-03 00:33:49,090 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.ContainerExecutor:
{noformat}

Script seems to exit with exit code of 1. To debug further, I wanted to see the command being execute, but in the logs I can see only the line as shown below

{noformat}
2013-01-03 00:33:46,591 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.DefaultContainerExecutor: launchContainer: [bash, /data/disk2/yarn/local/usercache/hadoop/appcache/application_1357147147433_0011/container_1357147147433_0011_01_000001/default_container_executor.sh]
{noformat}

Once task fails, this directory is cleaned up. There seems to be no easy way to find out why container is failing. It would be good to log contents of default_container_executor.sh along with the path., Lohit, if you set yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec then the launch script won't be deleted straightaway, which helps with debugging., Do we still need this jira to remain open or suggested approach by Tom works for you [~lohit] ?, Resolving as wont invalid]
