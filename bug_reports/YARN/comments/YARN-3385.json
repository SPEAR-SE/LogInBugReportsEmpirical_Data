[The sequence for the Race condition is the following:
1, RM try to remove application application_1426560404988_0132 state from ZKRMStateStore.
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:48,075 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.RMAppManager: Max number of completed apps kept in state store met: maxCompletedAppsInStateStore = 10000, removing app application_1426560404988_0132 from state store.
2015-03-17 19:18:48,075 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.RMStateStore: Removing info for app: application_1426560404988_0132
{code}

2. Unluckily ConnectionLoss for the ZK session happened at the same time as RM remove application state from ZK.
The ZooKeeper server deleted the node successfully, But due to ConnectionLoss, RM didn't know the operation succeeded.
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:51,836 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore: Exception while executing a ZK operation.
org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$ConnectionLossException: KeeperErrorCode = ConnectionLoss
{code}

3.RM did retry to remove application state to ZK
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:51,837 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore: Retrying operation on ZK. Retry no. 1
{code}

4. during the retry, the ZK session is reconnected.
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:58,924 INFO org.apache.zookeeper.ClientCnxn: Session establishment complete on server, sessionid = 0x24be28f536e2006, negotiated timeout = 10000
{code}

5. Because the node was already deleted successfully at ZooKeeper in the previous operation, it will fail with NoNode KeeperException for the retry
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:58,956 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore: Exception while executing a ZK operation.
org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoNodeException: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode
2015-03-17 19:18:58,956 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.ZKRMStateStore: Maxed out ZK retries. Giving up!
{code}

6.This NoNode KeeperException will cause removing app failure in RMStateStore
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:58,956 ERROR org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.recovery.RMStateStore: Error removing app: application_1426560404988_0132
org.apache.zookeeper.KeeperException$NoNodeException: KeeperErrorCode = NoNode
{code}

7.RMStateStore will send RMFatalEventType.STATE_STORE_OP_FAILED event to ResourceManager
{code}
  protected void notifyStoreOperationFailed(Exception failureCause) {
    RMFatalEventType type;
    if (failureCause instanceof StoreFencedException) {
      type = RMFatalEventType.STATE_STORE_FENCED;
    } else {
      type = RMFatalEventType.STATE_STORE_OP_FAILED;
    }
    rmDispatcher.getEventHandler().handle(new RMFatalEvent(type, failureCause));
  }
{code}

8.ResoureManager will kill itself after received STATE_STORE_OP_FAILED RMFatalEvent.
{code}
2015-03-17 19:18:58,958 FATAL org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.ResourceManager: Received a org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.RMFatalEvent of type STATE_STORE_OP_FAILED. Cause:

2015-03-17 19:18:58,959 INFO org.apache.hadoop.util.ExitUtil: Exiting with status 1
{code}
, I uploaded a patch YARN-3385.000.patch for review. The patch fixed both Op.delete and zkClient.delete for NoNodeException and optimized the code at removeRMDelegationTokenState to skip ZK delete operation if the node doesn't exist.

Without the patch, the test will fail with the following message
{code}

This message is automatically generated., [~zxu] , could you please rebase the patch since it doesn't seem to apply ?, Thanks [~sidharta-s], I uploaded a new patch YARN-3385.001.patch based on the latest code base., thanks [~zxu] ! I'll review this.
 The zk.delete seems not idempotent.
I think in general, if we have YARN-2716, this problem can be resolved along with that.  do you think so ?, Agreed, If we have YARN-2716, this problem may be solved with it. thanks [~jianhe]!
It may take sometime to stabilize YARN-2716, In the interim, it will be useful to fix this issue., \\

This message was automatically generated., Tx for working on this [~zxu]!

Some comments
 - Some commands have multiple delete commands and only one of them may fail - know what happens to the remaining ops?
 - Please rename the existing doMultiWithRetries() to be doStoreMultiWithRetries() and create a new doDeleteMultiWithRetries().

testRMAppDeleteNoNodeException()
 - conf is unused.
 - Rename the test to be testDuplicateRMAppDeletion()., [~vinodkv], thanks for the thorough review.
bq. Some commands have multiple delete commands and only one of them may fail ......
Based on the document about ZooKeeper#multi: {{Executes multiple ZooKeeper operations or none of them.}}, for multiple delete commands, either all delete operations are done or none of them are done. So I think if any one of them fails, the remaining ops won't be done.

I uploaded a new patch YARN-3385.002.patch, which addressed all your comments. Please review it., By the way, I forget to mention, if NoNodeException happened due to this race condition, it means one of the delete operations was done, because {{zkClient.multi}} will either execute all of the Op's or none of them, all of the delete operations must be done. [This|http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2011/06/tour-of-multi-update-for-zookeeper.html] is a good article which talks about [multi update for zookeeper|http://tdunning.blogspot.com/2011/06/tour-of-multi-update-for-zookeeper.html], \\

This message was automatically generated., This looks good, +1. Checking this in.., Actually, there is a checkstyle warning and a test related problem. Please look at them., I attached a new patch YARN-3385.003.patch which is to fix the check style issue. Also it is strange the test report log didn't show any test failure.
