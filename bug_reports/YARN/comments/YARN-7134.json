[We could move {{SchedulingMode}} to {{resourcemanager.scheduler}} package so that other schedulers also can make use of the same.
cc:/ [~sunilg], Yes. We could move to scheduler package itself., This one popped up on my dashboard as a 3.0.0 GA blocker, could I get a status update? Is there an assignee?, I ll take over this. Thanks [~andrew.wang], Thanks Sunil!, [~templedf], the SchedulingMode and AppSchedulingInfo are all internal classes of scheduler. I don't think this blocks anything. Downgrading to major.]
