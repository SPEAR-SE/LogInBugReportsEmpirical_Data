This message is automatically generated., The findbugs warnings are unrelated, caused by YARN-3181 and handled by YARN-3204., [~jianhe], would you like to take a look at this? Thanks!, lgtm,  +1, I found given that "RMContext#getRMNodes" uses NodeId, do you think "RMContext#getInactiveRMNodes" can use NodeId as the key too for consistency ?, {quote}
I found given that "RMContext#getRMNodes" uses NodeId, do you think "RMContext#getInactiveRMNodes" can use NodeId as the key too for consistency ?
{quote}
To me the only concern is that this will change the {{RMContext}} interface. Do you think that's OK?, since it's internal to RM only, I think it's ok. your opinion ?, I agree with you. Will upload a new version with NodeId as key., Updated patch, which uses NodeId as map key., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
