[It seems that all access to the map that is returned by FSSchedulerApp.getResourceRequests() is properly synchronized with the FSSchedulerApp instance, but this one is missed.

I suspect a fix here is to synchronize the iteration with the same lock. Thoughts?, I did an escape analysis on the value maps that are stored in AppSchedulingInfo.requests. The synchronization policy seems a little inconsistent in that for the most part it is really protected by the FSSchedulerApp and FiCaSchedulerApp instances. However, most access is also guarded by the AppSchedulingInfo instance itself.

In any case, the intention of the existing code seems to be guarding these maps with the FSSchedulerApp/FiCaSchedulerApp instances. Currently there are three access points that are not guarded by the app instances:
- AppSchedulable.updateDemand() (this one)
- FSSchedulerApp/FiCaSchedulerApp.getResource(Priority)
- FSSchedulerApp/FiCaSchedulerApp.getResourceRequest(Priority,String)

I'll create a patch that synchronizes the code with the app instance in these access points., Hmm, it seems like the code has changed somewhat between 2.0.5 and the trunk. Looking into the latest and greatest., I've submitted the patch. I've added synchronization to the following places:
- SchedulerApplicationAttempt.getResourceRequest(Priority, String)
- SchedulerApplicationAttempt.getResource(Priority)
- FiCaSchedulerApp.getTotalPendingRequests()
- AppSchedulable.updateDemand()

This message is automatically generated., This concerns thread safety, and it is not practical to have unit tests that verify thread safety. I did a complete analysis of access to the map in question., +1 on the patch. Can anyone else review this as well., Let me take a look later today. , +1, Committed this to trunk and branch-2.  It didn't apply well to branch-2.3, because SchedulerApplicationAttempt doesn't exist.  Can commit there for 2.3.1 if someone can upload a diff that applies?, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5159 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5159/])

, Hmm, I thought that refactoring had already happened in branch-2.3, but I guess I was mistaken. I'll post a separate patch for branch-2.3., This should apply for branch-2.3. It seems that the class in 2.3 is named SchedulerApplication. Otherwise, the fix is identical., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #480 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/480/])
