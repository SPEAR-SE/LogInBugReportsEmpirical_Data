[Hi [~gu chi]
Could you please help to share debug logs also. We have seen this pblm few cases while using DRC. It will be really great if you could share RM logs and AM logs., Same using DRC.
:( Debug Log was only enabled after I saw the issue, so before that, no debug infomation. 
I got RM log, but several GB with hundreds applications., I added some extra log to trace, do you have any idea how can probably reproduce?, [~sunilg], we do not have AM debug logs. And RM debug logs are after the event so all we get from it is that pending resources are negative which leads to the log guchi mentioned above. Let us see if we get something more from code., Not sure if this is related, but we are also seeing similar results in 2.7 for reserved containers:
{noformat}
    "name" : "Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=QueueMetrics,q0=root,q1=bigmem",
...
    "ReservedMB" : -6553600,
    "ReservedVCores" : -8000,
    "ReservedContainers" : -800,
...
{noformat}, This should be fixed by YARN-4844. Closing as dup.]
