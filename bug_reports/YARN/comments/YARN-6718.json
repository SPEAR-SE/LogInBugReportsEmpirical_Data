, Thanks, [~grant.sohn].  Actually, can we change "ResourceManager" to "resource manager"?  The typical consumers of our logs are not going to be impressed by our use of camel case., Also, it looks like you need to rebase or try again against trunk., Looks like trunk already has the fix.  I could probably just fix Resourcemanager to make consistent with the rest of the logging., These spelling mistakes were fixed by HDFS-11574.]
