[Part of the issue here is that adding child queues to what was a leaf queue has some similarities with the delete queue case, and the delete queue case currently is not supported.  Applications only run in leaf queues, so changing a leaf queue into a parent queue is sort of like deleting the leaf queue and adding a parent queuethat happens to have the same name.  Like the delete scenario, we have to determine what to do with the applications currently running on the leaf queue when the reconfig occurs.  Do we terminate the active applications?  Stop accepting new applications but let the current ones drain before reconfiguring?  In the short term, I think it's a documentation issue to state it's not a supported operation.  Once support for queue delete is added, I think support for this would be straightforward (or vice-versa)., For now we should punt on this - this is akin to 'delete queue' as Jason explained.]
