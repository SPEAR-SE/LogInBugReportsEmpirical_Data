This message was automatically generated., Hi [~jlowe], It is a good catch. It is nice to make an useless variable {{logAggregationDisabled}} become useful. {{initApp}} will catch {{YarnRuntimeException}} and send event {{APPLICATION_LOG_HANDLING_FAILED}} to {{ApplicationImpl}}, {{ApplicationImpl}} will send event {{LogHandlerAppFinishedEvent}} to clean up the local application logs {{doAppLogAggregationPostCleanUp}} when application finished.
