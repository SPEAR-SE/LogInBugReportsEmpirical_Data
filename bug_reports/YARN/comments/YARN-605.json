[~tgraves] Any comments on whether matches() is needed? I am guessing something in the strings ( maybe a '-' ) is causing problems when using a regex match., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I'd like to understand what exactly is different before changing anything., {code}
    String a ="3.0.0-SNAPSHOT from f6e4a3a01fd1e341b3750c5843e2588a26d0db31 (HEAD, origin/trunk, origin/HEAD, yarn605, trunk) by Hitesh source checksum f89f5c9b9c9d44cf3be5c2686f2d789";

    System.out.println("A equals B: " + a.equals(b));
    System.out.println("B equals A: " + b.equals(a));
    System.out.println("A matches B: " + a.matches(b));
    System.out.println("B matches A: " + b.matches(a));
    System.out.println("C equals D: " + c.equals(d));

    System.out.println("C matches D: " + c.matches(d));
    System.out.println("D matches C: " + d.matches(c));
{code}

The above results in:

{code}
A equals B: true
B equals A: true
A matches B: false
B matches A: false
C equals D: true
D equals C: true
C matches D: true
D matches C: true

The string matches function fails to match due to the parenthesis in the strings., Using git 1.7.3.4.

The log decorate ends up displaying branch information with the commit info which breaks the match functionality.
, thanks Hitesh for digging into that.  I'm fine with changing it to equals. I haven't actually tried your patch yet but I would expect the TestHSWebServices to have a similar check. , The changes look good to me too. +1.

Ran all the tests, passed. Checking it in., [~tgraves] I hadn't gotten around to playing around with MR tests yet. Have file a separate jira for TestHSWebServices. Will run the full MR tests and modify the jira/patch as needed., I just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
