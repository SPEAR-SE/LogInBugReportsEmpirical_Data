, This seems to have broken the build:

https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/25/artifact/trunk/patchprocess/trunkJavacWarnings.txt

I get the same failure building locally:

[ERROR] /home/adi/w/apache-hadoop-trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-j
obclient/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/ResourceMgrDelegate.java:[46,29] package org.hadoop.yarn.client do
es not exist
, Eli fixed this with a quick patch in svn 1381315, git-svn commit d6b7706c0c., Thats because this was broken into 2 patches. 1 for YARN and 1 for MR. MAPREDUCE-4635 linked to this jira. Vinod wanted to make different patches for the different projects. What Eli checked in is exactly the patch attached to MAPREDUCE-4635. I will go ahead and resolve that. Sorry for the trouble., Andy/Eli, I separated the patches and was waiting for Jenkins to bless the MapReduce patch at MAPREDUCE-4635.

Also please file a ticket for such code changes instead of stray-commits. Tx., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #1157 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/1157/])
