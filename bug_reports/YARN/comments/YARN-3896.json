[Good finding [~hex108].

I think we need to reset the responseId to 0 as part of registerNodeManager itself before triggering RMNodeReconnectEvent, instead of handling as part of ReconnectNodeTransition., Thanks [~devaraj.k] for the suggestion. 

Attach the patch as suggested., Thanks [~hex108] for delivering the patch quickly.

Can you also add a test to simulate the scenario as part of the patch?

This message was automatically generated., Failed test cases are not related, they are addressed in YARN-3909 and YARN-3910. Kindly review the patch please., Thanks [~hex108] for the updated patch. 

There are some comments about the test.
# Can we have a separate new test for this case instead of adding it with other existing test?
# Can you avoid mentioning the JIRA ID in the comment?
       {code:xml}+    // Simulate scenario from YARN-3896:{code}
# There are multiple sleep statements with hard coded values in the newly added test code. Can you avoid these sleep with hard coded timeouts?
# And also If I try to run the test without source changes, test is failing with this message "node shouldn't be null". Can we check for REBOOTED state here?, Thanks [~devaraj.k] for the review and comments.

Update a new patch to address your comments.

{quote}
The reason for sleep statements: 1. simulate that RM is busying with dealing with RMNodeEvent 2.wait until event has been processed. Is it reasonable?, \\

This message was automatically generated., [~devaraj.k], could you please help review the latest patch?  Thanks., Thanks [~hex108] for the patch, overall patch looks good to me.. Verified the tests without source, it is failing every time.. 
nit: Can you add public modifier to the interface api i.e. {{void resetLastNodeHeartBeatResponse();}}?, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for the review.

RMNode is a public interface. checkstyle will report an error 'Redundant public modifier' if adding a public modifer to the method., Thanks for the clariffication.., When I applying the patch, patch apply was failing for 2 chunks in RMNodeImpl. So rebased patch against trunk and uploading to check Jenkins result.. Once HadooQA runs, will commit it.. , [~rohithsharma] Thanks for the help.  Re-submit your same patch to trigger Jenkins., \\

, I committed this to branch-2.7 and branch-2.6 as well., I think we may also need to fix NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.rebootNodeStatusUpdaterAndRegisterWithRM() to retry the register to RM when have non-fatal exception. Will file a separate JIRA to fix/discuss this., Filed YARN-4274.]
