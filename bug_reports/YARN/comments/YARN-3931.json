[node-label-expression is initialized to empty string 
{code}
...
public ApplicationSubmissionContextInfo() {
  applicationId = "";
  applicationName = "";
  containerInfo = new ContainerLaunchContextInfo();
  resource = new ResourceInfo();
  priority = Priority.UNDEFINED.getPriority();
  isUnmanagedAM = false;
  cancelTokensWhenComplete = true;
  keepContainers = false;
  applicationType = "";
  tags = new HashSet<String>();
  appNodeLabelExpression = "";
  amContainerNodeLabelExpression = "";
}
{code}

but, check whether node-label-expression is null or not
{code}
// check labels in the resource request.
String labelExp = resReq.getNodeLabelExpression();

// if queue has default label expression, and RR doesn't have, use the
// default label expression of queue
if (labelExp == null && queueInfo != null) {
  labelExp = queueInfo.getDefaultNodeLabelExpression();
  resReq.setNodeLabelExpression(labelExp);
}
{code}, Hi [~kyungwan nam], Thanks for raising the issue ... i have assigned this jira to my name but if you are interested to further look into this jira and solve it . please reassign., hi, i couldn't reassign it to me.
i think i don't have the privilege to assign issue, [~kyungwan nam], Good that you are trying to contribute :), we need to request some committer to add you to the list of contributors but in the mean time you can upload the patch with test case i can help you in reviewing....
[~wangda tan], 
Can you please add [~kyungwan nam] to the contributor list and assign him this jira ?, Thanks for raising the issue [~kyungwan nam], I just added you to contributor list and assigned the JIRA to you., I attached the patch. it work well in my cluster... :), This reminds me an earlier trouble i have met. Hi [~Naganarasimha], can we consider to remove the "" node label expression in the code? It seems not make sense we set a node label as "". For node label expression, it should be "some_label" or null. 

Just an unrigorous thoughts, what do you think?, \\

This message was automatically generated., "application-name", "application-type” are empty string, not default value when i submit an application by rest api without those.
that's caused by same reason…
can i fix it here? if you want i’ll create another issue., Sorry for response late. Fix looks good, thanks [~kyungwan nam].
+1 to fix application-name / application-type together in the patch, we need to make behavior consistent when using REST API / Java API to submit application., [~wangda], [~kyungwan nam] - ping, can we apply this?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
