{noformat}, [~djp], I think we can create one JIRA for findbugs to track it.
Otherwise there is no way to report it. We can keep on closing it and reopening it whenever new findbugs warnings come. 
As the change is very small for findbugs, it can be fixed as part of other JIRAs' and this can be used for tracking.
I will fix this in YARN-4053., Or maybe reopen YARN-3952 and change title to track findbugs in that one. Thoughts ?, This is not an issue in branch. Earlier warnings I found might be due to a dirty workspace., Hi [~varun_saxena], thanks for your comments!
bq. We can keep on closing it and reopening it whenever new findbugs warnings come.
In general, we don't recommend to keep track of multiple commits within the same JIRA. The reason is for release as it will bring extra difficulties to track down commits with the same JIRA number.

I saw you already resolve this. My additional comments on fixing minor things (findbugs, checkstyle, etc.) on a dev branch is: if it related to trunk, leave it to the fix on trunk or it will have unnecessary merge conflict in future; if there are many things to fix, we can create a separated JIRA to fix or merge the single line of fix to an existing patch sounds like a better way.]
