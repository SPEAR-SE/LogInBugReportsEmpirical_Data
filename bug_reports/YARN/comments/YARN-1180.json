This is a JIRA for updating documentation. It will be great to file a new JIRA for your question. Thanks! , Thanks for the patch, Chen. I have taken a look at this patch and I noticed that you have added the types on the configs. Everything looks good there. One thing I did notice is that user-metrics.enable, resource-calculator, node-locality-delay, and possibly others have been left undocumented for some time. I'm okay with doing that work as part of another JIRA or expanding the scope of this JIRA to do that work. 

Jon, Thank you, Jon. I have created  a new JIRA for the update you mentioned. It is YARN-1520., +1. Thanks for the patch, Chen.
