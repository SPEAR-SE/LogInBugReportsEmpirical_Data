[In such case, YARN Client resubmit the application to new RM with new application id. To the user, there is NO impact. Submitted application start running and succeeds. You should be seeing a log in client something like "Re-submit application <applicationId> with the same ApplicationSubmissionContext"

What is the problem are you faced with this kind of restart? Doesn't your application resubmitted and succeeded? , The failure is a pig job. AfterÂ a client submitted an application successfully, later when it tries to query the status of the app then failed. Who is going to re-submit the application? Are you saying when using the Yarn API to get application it will automatically resubmit the application?]
