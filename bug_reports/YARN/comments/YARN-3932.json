[Hi [~leftnoteasy] i think we should iterate over {{liveContainers}} get sum of resource used. Any thoughts??, [~bibinchundatt],
I think we can add a method such as getTotalUsed in ResourceUsage class, which will be more efficient than iterating all liveContainers. This can be done in the near term.

To make it correct, I think we need to return usage-by-partition object to application, which requires to change APIs., [~leftnoteasy] used {{attemptResourceUsage.getAllUsed()}} already available method., Thanks for update [~bibinchundatt], could you add a test for this to avoid future regression?, Attaching patch with testcase , \\
