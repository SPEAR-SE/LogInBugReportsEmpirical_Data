[This is a problem when the cluster is configured with a restrictive umask (e.g.: fs.permissions.umask-mode=0077)., Patch to change the ContainerLocalizer so it creates the cache directories with 0710 (rwx--x---) permissions so the nodemanager user can check for existence of files in the cache without having to become that user.  This also matches the behavior of the DefaultContainerExecutor., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Sigh, the hadoop7 (uberjake42) Jenkins machine is apparently full of runaway threads and can't perform a build anymore, so the failure is unrelated to the patch.  Will try to find someone who has access to the machine to clean it up and then rekick the build later., Bobby helped me clean up some leaked processes on one of the build machines.
