[1st patch, I made a patch which pass the posted test without exception., Tucu/Bo - We don't support mradmin anymore. We support the analogous rmadmin command via bin/yarn., Thanks for the clarification Arun. Then, we should change hadoop script so mrgroups prints a deprecated message and fallbacks to the yarn script., Hi Arun, thanks for the feedback. I have a question that currently "bin/yarn rmadmin" is a set of refresh commands. Would query commands (e.g. "bin/mapred groups") also be added there?, Any further comments on this, Arun? Thanks., Yes, it's fine to port get* commands from bin/mapred to bin/yarn as they make sense., Thank you, Arun. It looks good to me to have get* commands there. Let getGroups be the first one. Will upload a patch later., Fixed the bug and added a command "-getGroups [username]" to bin/yarn rmadmin, Looked at the patch, got comments:
 - Update the patch to reflect the project changes post YARN-1.
 - All the new definitions added are cloned from HDFS. We should promote these from HDFS to Common (in a separate Common JIRA) and reuse code instead of duplicating it all over again., Hi Vinod,

Thanks for looking at the patch. I'd like to clarify the two comments.

- To reflect YARN-1, do you mean move org.apache.hadoop.mapred.tools.GetGroups to org.apache.hadoop.yarn.tools.GetGroups?
  Currently there is no such package in hadoop-yarn-common yet, but I can create one. Actually, "bin/yarn rmadmin -getGroups" doesn't call to org.apache.hadoop.mapred.tools.GetGroups but org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.tools.RMAdmin. GetGroups can be left there for backward compatibility or removed directly.

- I am not sure what definitions in HDFS you referred to. Would you mind giving it a bit more elaboration?

Thanks,
Bo
, Apologies for the delay, this one's slipped off my list.

 - By reflecting YARN-1, I meant splitting the patch and track a common JIRA for the common changes. Sorry, should've been clearer.
 - Regarding my comment about HDFS definitions, see GetUserMappingsProtocolPB, GetUserMappingsProtocolClientSideTranslatorPB, GetUserMappingsProtocolServerSideTranslatorPB from org.apache.hadoop.hdfs.protocolPB package in HDFS. The new classes added in your patch are almost the same as these. Even the proto definition GetUserMappingsProtocol.proto is already there in HDFS. I am suggesting we promote these classes and the PB definitions from HDFS into common and then use them in YARN.

Does that make sense?

, Thank you, Vinod =)

I got what you mean. I created a JIRA in common (HADOOP-8805) for moving the PB stuffs from HDFS to Common., Separated protobuf stuffs into HADOOP-8805. Tested on hadoop-2.1.0, Tested YARN-53-v3.patch on hadoop-2.0.0-alpha, Tested in command line

This message is automatically generated., The update patch looks good, Bo! Particularly I like that we are not starting a new server for looking up groups (which I somehow missed earlier). There is far lesser code-duplication now, even without HADOOP-8805.

+1 for the patch. Tested on a single node. Committing this., Wanted to point out that the test can be simplified by using MiniYarnCluster if the groups-tools didn't belong to RM package (which is how it should be anyways). Will open a separate ticket for moving out tools into the client package., Committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Bo!, Thanks for reviewing and committing, Vinod! MiniYarnCluster is a better (and very concise) way to go for the testcase. I tried to use it but couldn't, as you pointed out, because of the package issue. +1 for moving it into client package., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2759 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2759/])
