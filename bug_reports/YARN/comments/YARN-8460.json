[Hi [~ssathish@hortonworks.com]

I think we have conf exposed via REST, can you try something like
{code}
curl --header "accept: application/xml" http://rm.host.address:8088/conf?name=yarn.cluster.max-application-priority
{code}
, Thanks [~cheersyang] 

Yes, this is definitely a doable way as we get the data from conf obj which is fine in cases of using other config providers too. 

[~ssathish@hortonworks.com] I think this is a better model rather than adding such cli/rest for other global params like app timeout too]
