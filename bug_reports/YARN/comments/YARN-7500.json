[bq. Currently LogAggregation deletes the application logs based on start time of the job.

The log aggregation deletion service does not do anything based on the application start or completion time.  It only is checking modification timestamps in the filesystem:
{code}
    private static boolean shouldDeleteLogDir(FileStatus dir, long cutoffMillis, 
        FileSystem fs) {
      boolean shouldDelete = true;
      try {
        for(FileStatus node: fs.listStatus(dir.getPath())) {
          if(node.getModificationTime() >= cutoffMillis) {
            shouldDelete = false;
            break;
          }
        }
{code}

So if any entry within the log directory has a modification timestamp that is newer than the log retention it will not delete the entire log directory., [~jlowe] Oh yes, missed it. 

The issue is our customer has a long running custom Yarn Application which has started before yarn.log-aggregation.retain-seconds and was running yesterday as per the RM UI, and today we din see any logs under app-logs. Logs where there for running job. Looks only possibility is the custom app has not updated the logs for many days.

Will check RM logs and hdfs-audit logs to validate and give more information.]
