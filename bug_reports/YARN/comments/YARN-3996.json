[CIIAW, SchedulerUtils.normalizeRequests() is being called in allocate() in CS and FS which resourceRequest is normalized(reset) to minimumAllocation. So, it should not be matter for AM container resource Request where normalization is done in RMAppManager. Instead of normalizing at scheduler, here normalization is done at RMAppManager. Does this is impacting?, I would like to work on this JIRA if no one has already begun.
If yes, could you please assign the JIRA to me?

Thank you., The idea here is:
Scenario:
1) The ResourceRequest can be requesting for a value in memory that is in between RM_SCHEDULER_MINIMUM_ALLOCATION_MB and RM_SCHEDULER_INCREMENT_ALLOCATION_MB 
Where, let's say, the minimum is set to zero while the increment is 512MB and the request is 256MB
In such an event, the normalizeRequest() will normalize the request to the minimum as opposed to the increment which will be 512MB and fulfilling the request.

a. I think we may have to change the 
Resource normalize(
      ResourceCalculator calculator, Resource lhs, Resource min,
      Resource max, Resource increment)
with a check for Zero requests

But that would more of a core change that I am not too sure to do if it breaks anything else.

b. The other would be to check the zero requests and add a check in the Fair and Capacity scheduler code prior to calling  SchedulerUtils.normalizeRequests()

Thoughts?

Thank you., SchedulerUtils has multiple overloads of normalizeRequests. The ones that take in increment and min handle what you are looking to do. 
Fair has support for the increment and Fifo/Capacity do not. So Fair does multiple of increment and uses min for min while Fifo/Capacity does multiple of min and use min for min. Basically Capacity/Fifo are setting incr also to min. We need to do the same in RMAppManager.
That way Fair can continue supporting zero min and use multiple of incr and Fifo/Capacity can choose to not support zero min and support multiple of min. , \\

This message was automatically generated., I'll go back and fix those. I know why this happened; the added implementation of incrementAllocationCapability on Fifo and Capacity. Need to do this in a better way.

Will update soon.

Thank you., Resolved the issues with the Capacity, FIFO and SLS schedulers.

I am not sure how to approach the testing. Wrote a basic unit test for this at the moment.

Trying to think how to make it more robust.
Will update if I think of a sturdier approach.

In the meantime, requesting some feedback on version 002 of the patch.

Thank you., \\

This message was automatically generated., Why should a minimum resource of 0 be ever supported? , [~hitesh], a reason is given on YARN-789., [~neelesh77], mind refreshing the patch?  It doesn't apply anymore.  Also, looking at the latest patch, I don't see where you ultimately changed anything.  Did you forget to include the fair scheduler changes?, [~templedf], it's been a while since I have looked at this and I don't think I can continue it. Feel free to reassign since I don't have cycles to work on this, atm., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
