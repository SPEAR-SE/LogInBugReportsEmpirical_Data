This message is automatically generated., Jason, the patch looks good in what it's doing. There are a few more directories created by the DefaultContainerExecutor - for which no explicit permissions are set rightnow. Specifically, usercache/${user}/appcache/${appId}/${containerId} and a temp dir. Should permission for these additional dirs be set via this patch ?, At first I didn't think other things besides the user needed access to the files within the containerId directory, but now that I think about it I believe that's necessary for the nodemanager to serve up the logs of an actively running container.  As for the temp directory, only the user should need access to that directory.

I'll update the patch accordingly., Doh, nevermind I got confused.  The logs are served up from the logs directory not the container directory, and those permissions are set correctly after this patch.

It does make me wonder why we are explicitly granting group directory execute access to the appId directory.  What does the nodemanager user need to access in there?  Should we instead be locking down the usercache/${user}/appcache/${appId} to 700?  If so, then we're OK using default permissions on the container and temp directories since the parent directory is locked down.  If it is necessary for the appId directory to be 710, then it seems like the containerId should also be 710 and the temp directory should be 700., Updated the patch to have the container and temp directory use the same permissions as the appId directory.  This is what the LinuxContainerExecutor does., bq. It does make me wonder why we are explicitly granting group directory execute access to the appId directory.

If it is necessary for the appId directory to be 710, then it seems like the containerId should also be 710 and the temp directory should be 700.

Good point, 700 does seem to be adequate. Can't think of where the NM may need group access. Needs some looking into.
For now, will look at and commit the new patch., Patch looks good. +1 subject to a jenkins run. Need someone with access to start a run though.

The LCE appears to have the same issue - with a restrictive umask. Also, the LCE uses 750 in most places, instead of the 710 used by the DCE., I kicked jenkins., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
