This message was automatically generated., Please review patch attached., Can you extract {{context.getContainers().get(containerId)}} to variable and use the same later?, Hi [~rohithsharma]
Thnks for looking into the issue.
Updated patch as per comments, Hi [~bibinchundatt]
Thanks for reporting this issue. 
A minor nit: Warning message can be improved.
{{LOG.warn("Log aggregation cannot be started for " + containerId + ", as its an absent container");}}

And one more question, why this container is absent. Is it already killed before starting to aggregate?, Hi [~sunilg]

Thnks for comments.Updated patch as per comments
The operation performed was kill app and context container entry is not available., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~bibinchundatt].

Yes, container seems like was not present in context. And this has happened in CONTAINER_FINISHED event, so absent container scenario can be handled with this check. And looks like this case is also handled in other events, may be you could double check it and make sure similar incidents are handled for other events also.
Other wise patch looks good to me., Looks like only for {{LogAggregationService}} exists. {{ContainerEventDispatcher}} its handled., +1 lgtm.. Committed to branch-2/trunk. Thanks [~bibinchundatt] for contributions!! [~sunilg] for the review!!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8508 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8508/])
