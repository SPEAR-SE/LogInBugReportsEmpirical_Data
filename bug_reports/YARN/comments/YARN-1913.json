[Which scheduler are you using?  The CapacityScheduler already has a yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent property, and there's a per-queue form of it as well., This is a Fair Scheduler issue.  We need to add an equivalent property to the Fair Scheduler., init patch for review.
Add queueMaxAMShare configuration for each queue. And update the code in MaxRunningAppsEnforcer.java by considering AM share. Instead of using accurate AM resource usage, here use an easier way. The max_app_limited_by_AM = (queue.queueMaxAMShare * queue.maxShare) / scheduler.minAllocation., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I think we should avoid doing approximate calculation through the minimum allocation.  We need to handle situations where AM resources are much larger than the min, and situations where the minimum allocation will be 0 (common on Llama-enabled clusters).

This would have the added benefit of avoiding touching the "runnability" machinery, which is already bordering on over-complicated., Thanks, Sandy.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the updated patch Wei.  For queues, maxAMShare should be defined as a fraction of the queue's fair share, not maxShare.  The majority of queues are configured with infinite maxResources.  We need to be careful with this, as fair shares can change when queues are created dynamically.

I think it might make sense to only allow the queue-level maxAMShare on leaf queues for the moment.  I can't think of a strong reason somebody would want to set it on a parent queue, and doing this would allow us to avoid the complex logic in MaxRunningAppsEnforcer, and merely enforce the AM max share by checking in AppSchedulable.assignContainer.  This is also what the Capacity Scheduler has at the moment.
, Thanks, Sandy. Will update a patch., Hey [~sandyr], quick comment 
bq.I think it might make sense to only allow the queue-level maxAMShare on leaf queues for the moment. I can't think of a strong reason somebody would want to set it on a parent queue
For NestedUserQueue rule, user queues would be created dynamically under a parent. For this use case,
maxAMShare at the parent would be useful, since leaf user queues are not configured in the alloc xml. 
I see your point that it would complicate the logic at MaxRunningAppsEnforcer,but just wanted to bring this up in case you
didn't consider this use case.
, Update a new patch to fix Sandy's comments.
[~ashwinshankar77], if the leaf queue is not configured, the default AM resource limit is (leaf_queue_fair_share * 1.0f), still limited by its fair share., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The primary benefit of the logic in MaxRunningAppsEnforcer is that it allows us to enforce maxRunningApps constraints from queues higher up in the hierarchy, and integrate these with user maxRunningApps constraints

As we won't have these issues for queue maxAMShares, I think we can avoid touching MaxRunningAppsEnforcer entirely and just do the checking inside AppSchedulable.assignContainer or FSLeafQueue.assignContainer.  , Thanks, Sandy.

This message is automatically generated., This is looking good.  A small things.

AppSchedulingInfo is only used to track pending resources.  We should hold amResource in SchedulerApplicationAttempt.

{code}
Take out space after exclamation point.

{code}
   @Override
+  public boolean checkIfAMResourceUsageOverLimit(Resource usage, Resource maxAMResource) {
+    return Resources.greaterThan(RESOURCE_CALCULATOR, null, usage, maxAMResource);

Simpler to just use "usage.getMemory() > maxAMResource.getMemory()".

{code}

{code}
I'm a little nervous about using the priority here because apps could unwittingly submit all requests at that priority.  Can we use SchedulerApplicationAttempt.getLiveContainers().isEmpty()?, Thanks, Sandy.
One problem may exist if we use SchedulerApplicationAttempt.getLiveContainers().isEmpty(), if the application is unManagedAM, it will not generate an AM resource request. Thus, the first request would be an actual task, not an AM.
Correct me if I'm wrong here., Update a patch. Use getLiveContainer().size() and unManagedAM to detect the AM container., The "M" un Unmanaged AM shouldn't be capitalized.  Otherwise, the patch LGTM., Thanks, Sandy. Fixed that problem., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
