[YARN-2605 changes the response header info in RMWebAppFilter, it used to use Refresh but now it is Location. Need to revise the test case to provide test coverage for webapp redirection., This patch fixes UT TestRMFailover.testRMWebAppRedirect, it covers all the tests against RM web app redirections., I set a false flag so that HttpURLConnection does NOT automatically follow the redirect, this fixes too many redirections problem. (In the past it doesn't have this problem because there is a refresh time of 3 seconds so the client is still able to retrieve the redirect url from the http header). I am now able to retrieve redirection url from header field "Location",  and null if there is no redirection. The overall logic is not changed, the test case is fixed now., \\
