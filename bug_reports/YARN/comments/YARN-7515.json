[There aren't enough logs from the precommit build to prove this, but I believe this could be a duplicate of YARN-6647.  All of these tests did not fail in the usual sense but were marked as timed out, but actually I think this was because these tests called System.exit which was misinterpreted as a surefire timeout.  From https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/18498/artifact/out/patch-unit-hadoop-yarn-project_hadoop-yarn_hadoop-yarn-server_hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager.txt:

[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.maven.plugins:maven-surefire-plugin:2.17:test (default-test) on project hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager: ExecutionException: java.lang.RuntimeException: The forked VM terminated without properly saying goodbye. VM crash or System.exit called?

YARN-6647 describes how ZKRMStateStore can cause the async dispatcher to call System.exit because it receives an unhandled exception due to badly managed InterruptedException received when the RM is trying to shut down.
, Thank you [~jlowe] for pointing out the duplicate JIRA. Closing this issue as duplicate.
