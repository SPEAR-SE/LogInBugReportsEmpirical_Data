This message was automatically generated., Quick note: this patch no longer applies to trunk. The current yarn-config.sh does not perform {{export YARN_CONF_DIR}}. We may want to verify if the problem still exists. , Canceling the patch since it no longer applies to trunk. We may want to follow up on this issue to verify it, though. , Is the issue still exist in trunk? I don't see this in trunk. Am I missing anything?, [~aw] since you re-wrote the shell logic, I am pretty sure this can be closed as 'no longer applicable'. Objections?, This is no longer a problem in both trunk and branch-2]
