[[~bibinchundatt], Agree a bad app in a public cluster kind of setup would be riskier. But the catch is, limit is in a pluggable state store so we need to ensure a cleaner way to do the check before we send a event to the state store., It is dupe of YARN-5006., [~naganarasimha_gr@apache.org]

Since the limit is in zookeeper side my point is check should be part of ZkStateStore. Similar to zk retry times limit validation we can have in ZkStateStore once the event is processed. Since StateStore dispatchers are different i think the cost for having the check after sending also should be fine. Application can be rejected from {{NEW_SAVING}} state directly. 
, I would suggest further discussions can be done in YARN-5006. There were discussions done in that JIRA, those can be continued. , [~rohithsharma]
Thank you for pointing out the jira.  Will fix this as part of YARN-5006.]
