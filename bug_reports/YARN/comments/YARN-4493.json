, Looks generally good to me.  Thanks, [~yufeigu]!  Please complete the javadocs for the methods you added, i.e. params, returns, etc.  Also, as was suggested before, some unit tests would be good to add., Looking closely into this issue. I found it is not reproducible, and the original logic is solid. For a runnable application, we have the following logic to make sure its resource requests meet the limitation of the target queue *before {{executeMove}}*:
{code}
      if (oldQueue.isRunnableApp(attempt)) {
        verifyMoveDoesNotViolateConstraints(attempt, oldQueue, targetQueue);
      }
 {code}
So, [~jiangyu1211], could you provide more details of this issue or the way to reproduce it?, I will close this as invalid. Feel free to reopen it if you have any concern., Hi [~yufeigu], this issue happened in our cluster and made the application orphan, i didn't check the trunk code, but base on version 2.4.0, you can reproduce it easily., Hi [~jiangyu1211], thanks for your information. The easy way to identify this issue would be to drop a debug jar to RM, and reproduce it. That might help us more. BTW, I don't think there is any maintenance release for 2.4. ]
