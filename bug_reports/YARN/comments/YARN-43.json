[The test was checking the metrics for decommissioned nodes against 0.  Since with jdk7 the other tests in the file can be run first, the metrics had decommissioned nodes to 1 when testDecommissionWithIncludeHosts started.

The test was already getting the initial metric count when starting the test, so simply change the assert to make sure the count hadn't changed instead of comparing to hardcoded 0., The patch doesn't compile code anymore.

Also, instead of this, how about adding a shutdown/destroy method in ClusterMetrics and call it on every test's tearDown()? That way, each test-case can start with a clean slate. Thoughts?, Looks like the trunk version of the test changed the variable name.   I'll look at implementing a destroy/reset type function in clusterMetrics., Changed this to have a destroy method in ClusterMetrics which gets called at teardown.

I chose not to have shutdown method since RM shuts down the metrics system when it shuts down.  I made this method visiblefortesting because I couldn't think of usecase for it to be public.  If you can think of one let me know., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
