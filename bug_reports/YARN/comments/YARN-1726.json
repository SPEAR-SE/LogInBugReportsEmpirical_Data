This message is automatically generated., This module is such a maintenance nightmare. I need to find some time to fix it.

In the mean while, can you add a test which could have caught this issue? I don't see any tests where this class gets instantiated., Thanks, [~vinodkv].
Sure, I'll update a testcase., A new patch:
(1) Fix the problem because of the AbstractYarnScheduler.
(2) Add testcases for AMSimulator amd NMSimulator.
(3) Update the TestSLSRunner to catch the possible exception from child thread during running. The old testcase cannot work as it cannot catch the child threads' exception., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
