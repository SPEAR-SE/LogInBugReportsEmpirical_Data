[Thanks [~Alexandre LINTE] for reporting the issue. 

Can you paste the exception if you see anything in the RM UI or in the RM logs?, Hi,

There is no Java stackstrace for this bug.
I think that the property yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications is in cause (default value is 10000), but it doesn't work properly.

Maybe yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications is only effective on ResourceManager GUI.

Regards,, [~Alexandre LINTE] Hey, could you provide which version of hadoop you are using ? 2.7 ?, [~Alexandre LINTE], This seems to be sorting issue with respect to the app ids. It is just considering the first four digits of the application number for sorting in ascending/descing order, due to this it is not showing the application ids having more that 9999 based on the order and it is mixing up with the other apps considering only the first 4 digits. You can see the attached image RMApps.png which shows displaying the apps having id>9999 with other apps,

!RMApps.png|thumbnail!

Please check and confirm whether is it happening same or not in your case by searching for the specific app id in the search box. Thanks., Hi,

xgong, Yes with 2.7.0 yarn version

devarak.j, Yes i confirm this is an asc/desc sortingissue with application id over 9999.

Regards,


, The datatable string sort algorithm has limitation.
It can not properly sort the string having having the combination of the string and numeric value. The application id "application_numericValue"
ie is why the sort is not working properly.

To fix the same we can use the datatable plugins natural sort alogorithm.
{CODE}
sb.append("[\n")
      .append("{'sType':'natural', 'aTargets': [0]")
      .append(", 'mRender': parseHadoopID }")
{CODE}

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~mohdshahidkhan] for the patch. 

Patch is not getting applied, can you please check it?

There are some comments at high level.

1. Can you also check the same for Node Manager Web UI Running Applications and Running Containers tables?
2. Newly added js code is missing the format, Please follow this coding guide line.
* Indent two spaces per level, not four., Hi Devaraj K , 

Please ignore the first patch. in the current patch have taken the nodemanager web ui issue as well.
The current patch is using the natural sort algorithm of the natural,js a plugin used for datatable to sort the data.
The natural sort plugin " https://github.com/DataTables/Plugins/blob/1.10.7/sorting/natural.js " is having the MIT license.
As per MIT license we can redistribute the code but we have to keep the license header.
The haddop patch verification tool does not allow the auther info
As of now i have not removed the  @author tag from the path file.
Please help me to address this issue.

, Did anyone do a performance test with this change?  Recently I'm seeing the main RM UI page taking a _lot_ longer to load with a full set of 10,000+ applications, and it appears to all be client-side processing.  It takes so long the client-side browser is complaining:
{noformat}
A script on this page may be busy, or it may have stopped responding. You can stop the script now, open the script in the debugger, or let the script continue.

Script: http://rmhost:8088/static/dt-plugin-1.10.7/sorting/natural.js
{noformat}
, Filed YARN-4357 to track the performance issue with the apps page., [~jlowe], thanks for reporting this. I did local test with a small number of apps only. 
I'm going to revert this patch to avoid regression., I verified locally by simulating 10k apps. the patch does affect the browser performance. 
[~mohdshahidkhan], would you like to take a crack at it?, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8811 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8811/])

, [~jianhe], Shahid is in my team and currently on leave.
Let me see if I can find a solution to this before he comes back.

natural.js has a lot of extraneous logic which is not directly related to what we want to do for sorting appIds'. Let me see if removing code improves performance., thanks Varun ! appreciate your help, Rewrote the logic for sorting.
In my tests, with 10000 finished apps and RM idle(no running apps), it takes more than 1 minute to load the apps page with previous script.

With the script in patch, it takes a few seconds., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~jianhe] / [~jlowe], kindly review.
Test failures unrelated.
Raised YARN-4379 and MAPREDUCE-6555 for 2 of the failures. For others, JIRA exist as well.
Findbugs warnings are unrelated as well. Had raised YARN-4298 for it earlier.

I have only changed the javascript file(natural.js). Rewrote the logic for natural sort from scratch keeping in mind the way our application ids', attempt ids', task ids', etc. are.
Other code is exactly the same as what Shahid had written., Added an image to show sorted app ids' with the script in the patch, [~jianhe], kindly review.
[~mohdshahidkhan], probably you can have a look as well., latest patch looks good to me, thanks [~varun_saxena], , +1

, Thanks [~jianhe] for the commit., Reopening the issue since commit has missed in branch-2.8. , Since this JIRA adds natural.js file which was not committed in branch-2.8, and its dependency JIRA were failing in regression. see MAPREDUCE-6700, Renamed the patch and submitted., Thanks Varun!! Patch apply cleanly in branch-2.8. Before committing I will wait for Jenkins to run to make sure everything works fine in branch-2.8, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, At first glance, test failures looks not related!! [~varun_saxena] / [~bibinchundatt] would you also confirm QA result?, Myself cross verified the test cases, these are not related to current patch. Committing shortly!!, committed to branch-2.8!! thanks Varun for providing patch!! and Bibin for finding a issue in regression!! , Closing the JIRA as part of 2.7.3 release.]
