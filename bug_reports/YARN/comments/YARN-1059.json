[It looks the root cause is that you've got line breaks in the socket addresses and {{Configuration.getSocketAddr()}} doesn't trim the string before trying to parse it.
For now: get the socket values on a single line {{<value>10.245.1.30:9010</value>}} and it should work, I've already thought about it. So I've tried to change it into one like with no luck. The exception still raised., It was my fault, I've changed another parameter to one line in the XML, so that's why RM was not able to start.

When I changed all of the parameters to one line (<value>10.245.1.30:9030</value> and etc) RM wa able to start. 

I suppose that this is a bug, because it's confusing., link to the underlying problem, {{ Configuration.getSocketAddr() }} doesn't trim the config string, Today none of the configuration parameters read ignores '\n' or ' ' or '\t'. This is not very critical downgrading its priority., Modifying title, it's duplicate with HADOOP-9869, Threw a patch to HADOOP-9869., The bug will be fixed there]
