[Attached the findbugs report (7 new warnings added), I don't see any findbugs warnings listed in the report. It is displaying as zero. [~varun_saxena] are you able to see it?
It might be problem with report generation too!!, [~rohithsharma], you will get the findbugs warnings if you run it locally. There is some problem in QA report which leads to findbugs HTML report showing 0 warnings despite having errors(and QA report showing -1 for it). Raised issue for that as well, Filed HADOOP-12312 for it., Attaching the findbugs report generated locally., Now there are no findbugs warnings in hadoop-yarn-server-common module. Closing this.]
