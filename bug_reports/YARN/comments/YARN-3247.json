This message is automatically generated., +1, committing this shortly. - the default value of RM_SCHEDULER is CapacityScheduler. However, the default value can be overridden when user has modified yarn-site.xml in a class path. Also, other test cases for CapacityScheduler configure the scheduler explicitly. We should do here also.

{code}
  protected ResourceScheduler createScheduler() {
    String schedulerClassName = conf.get(YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_SCHEDULER);
