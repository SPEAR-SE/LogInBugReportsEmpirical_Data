[Attached REST output for YARN-CONTAINERS entity types. There can be seen that master containers has metrics and also observe that memory value is very huge. Other containers metrics values are empty., [~rohithsharma], thanks for filing the issue.

bq. The CPU-Memory values taken are from current usage which monitor thread reports. But issue with it is aggregationOp is SUM. So Each time monitor thread reported values is being added and give some bigger values. But ideally it is not actual usage.
Yes, we want to aggregate usage which is being reported, at app level. This is intentional. We also plan to do accumulation of metrics along time dimension (effectively area under the curve). Also follow the discussion on YARN-4712.

bq. Some containers has metric values CPU-Memory, some are empty.
The container usage will be reported based on configuration of monitoring interval. Unlikely that this would be missed but also, please check if you have enabled timeline service on each of the NMs' where containers were allocated.

Memory reported is in bytes., Also can you attach complete REST output (specifiy fields=ALL) so that we can check when CONTAINER_CREATED and CONTAINER_FINISHED events were published and other info., Attached REST full output file, Here the containers are finishing in around 3 seconds, which is default container monitoring interval. I think that is why CPU and memory isn't reported here., [~rohithsharma], should we close this as "Not A Problem", if you are fine with it., Closed as Not a Problem. thank you all for discussing this JIRA.]
