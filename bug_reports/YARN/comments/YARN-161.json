, This patch corrects the compiler warnings/errors by specifying type parameters explicitly, so that the types are not raw.  The last line of the diff actually relaxes a type from Iterator<STATE> to raw Iterator.  This was the cleaner fix, because the logic afterwards doesn't need more specific type information.  It just needs to call toString on the elements, and all types have toString.

This patch will get a -1 from Jenkins for lack of new tests.  There are no logic changes here, and all existing tests pass., Looks good, kicked Jenkins.
