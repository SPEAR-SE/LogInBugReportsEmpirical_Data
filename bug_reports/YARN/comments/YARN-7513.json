, Holding the scheduler lock to get the demand for an application attempt does not seem correct. The call out used to come from the FSAppAttempt back to the scheduler and then was using FSAppAttempt for details. Which could have been the reason. However there was no locking at all on this call before YARN-3139 was implemented. Current releases of CDH do not have YARN-3139 and we do not have any issues in those releases.
Based on all that and the fact that we use private FSAppAttempt variables {{demand}} and {{appPriority}} I doubt that there will be a need now or that we ever had a reason for the locking.

Test failures are not related to this jira., By looking at the callers of {{getWeight()}}, they are in sorting schedulable and computing fair share, both require queue lock. The demand update also requires queue lock. In that sense, it is safe to remove the lock. Even for the new callers in the future, we mighty need lock of {{FSAppAttempt}} instead of the lock of {{FairScheduler}}.  
So, +1. , I'll commit it if there is no objection until tomorrow., Fine by me., Committed to trunk and branch-3.0. Thanks for the patch, [~wilfreds]. Thanks for the review, [~templedf]., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13266 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13266/])
