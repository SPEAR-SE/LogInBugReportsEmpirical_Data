[What version corresponds to that stacktrace?, I have 2.3.0, It is required for node/rack/ANY information to be set even when asking for node only. However the RM should not crash if the user input is bad., Marking this as blocker since this makes it easy to crash and DOS the RM by specifying incorrect input. This can be disastrous in real life when a buggy app can bring the entire cluster down. We should definitely fix this. If other committers think differently then please downgrade the priority., I'm not sure if anybody on this, I take a shot at this, hope to get your ideas. Thanks, [~gp.leftnoteasy] Did you get a chance to look at this? 

For now, I'll move this to 2.4 since it's a long-standing issue., Hi [~acmurthy], I think the patch I attached before should work, I hope get some reviews about this. Sorry for mis-understanding caused by my last comment., [~wangda] - Do you mind updating the patch? Looks like it's gone a little stale; I'll take another look. Thanks!, Btw, the description says 'without corresponding rack request', I think you mean 'off-switch request'.

I agree that the NPE should be fixed, but the app will hang since there isn't an 'off-switch request' and won't get any allocation... eventually, we need to detected this and fail the application..., bq. Btw, the description says 'without corresponding rack request', I think you mean 'off-switch request'.

I just edited the bug description... , I've uploaded a new patch against Hadoop trunk. Potentially, FifoScheduler has a similar problem, I updated code/test as well.
Hope to get your comments on this., Thanks [~wangda], marking it PA to get blessings from jenkins., +1 lgtm, I'll commit if Jenkins comes back clean., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
