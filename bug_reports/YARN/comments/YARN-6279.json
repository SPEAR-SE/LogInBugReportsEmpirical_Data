[I don't see any difference between the provided JSON and XML files. Could you please point out what's missing in the JSON? All the child queues (root.Engineering.Development and root.Engineering.TESTING) seem to be present., Agree with [~GergelyNovak]'s observation., [~ashishdoneriya], based on the JSON and the version did you run into YARN-2336? It looks like it is fixed in branch 2.8. Just in case there is a fix of that jira, YARN-3957., Sorry Guys, It seems like there was already a bug filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2336. In the json file there are duplicate keys ('childQueues') 'root.Engineering' that should not be 

childQueues : [
"queueName":"root.Engineering",
"childQueues":{ 
..
"queueName":"root.Engineering.Development"
..
},
"childQueues":{ 
..
"queueName":"root.Engineering.Testing"
..
}

]

I tested this on apache 2.4.1 and cloudera 5.9]
