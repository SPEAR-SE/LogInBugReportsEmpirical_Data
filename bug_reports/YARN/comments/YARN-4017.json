[http://insanecoding.blogspot.com/2007/11/pathmax-simply-isnt.html and https://www.gnu.org/software/hurd/hurd/porting/guidelines.html has some good discussion., What would you recommend as the buffer size? 16K?, It seems to me that using a defined value of 4096 should suffice. I'll upload a patch shortly. , uploading a patch with changes to container-executor to remove use to PATH_MAX . , \\

This message was automatically generated., The release artifact is unrelated to this JIRA. The patch simply uses a different constant (defined in configuration.h) instead of PATH_MAX - no additional tests are required.

[~vvasudev] , could you please review this patch? Thank you., +1. I'll commit this tomorrow if no one objects., Committed to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~sidharta-s]!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8616 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8616/])
