[Patch that sets the tracking URL to the RM app page when an AM attempt is killed.  Also refactored the places where this was done for FAILED attempts to better cover all the various ways an AM attempt can fail.

As for the unregister attempt failure, I'm tempted to leave that as-is since there will always be races between YARN-level kill/fail and apps unregistering.  As long as we point to the RM app page when something goes wrong, at least the user has something to start with to diagnose the problem rather than a bad link to nowhere., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
