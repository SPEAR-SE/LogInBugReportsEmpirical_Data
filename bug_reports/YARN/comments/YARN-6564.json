[Thanks [~akhilpb] for creating a JIRA. 

This looks like because of guava jar compatible version for hbase-client is different than hadoop guava dependencies. Hadoop guava version is 21.0 but hbase uses 12.01.
I think we should use hbase-shaded-client jar? cc : / [~vrushalic] [~jrottinghuis], I tried using hbase-shaded-client jar but RM start up itself failing with following error. Though guice jar is present in classpath, hbase shaded client jar is trying to load guava dependencies from shaded jar only. This appears like building hbase shaded client jar has issue. I am not sure somebody had tried using shaded since HBASE-13889.

, Thanks Rohith and Akhil, we will have to look into this. , Related jira which makes guava version configurable HADOOP-14380, Trunk is being rolled back to guava 11 
HADOOP-14386, Yes. I tested locally with HADOOP-14386 patch. It looks fine., Thanks Sunil for testing with HADOOP-14386 patch. We shall keep this JIRA open until HADOOP-14386 fixed. , [~rohithsharma] Now that HADOOP-14386 has been resolved, what is the correct move here?, I think this jira can be closed as "Not a problem"? , Yep, will close it.]
