[I will work on a patch for this., [~rohithsharma], [~sunilg] and I had a discussion on this -
 - Delete API is invoked from the client.
 - The Service AM is not running during this time since the service is stopped.
 - ATSv2 is designed to publish data within the scope of the application.
 - So it won't be possible to publish data to ATSv2 from a client.

Couple of options we have now -
 # UI2 can consume YARN Service GET REST API to determine if a service is in STOPPED state or deleted, using which the Delete/Stop options can be displayed correctly. There are some UI2 framework related changes that are required to make this happen. The effort here is of medium size.
 # ATSv2 can support publishing of data outside the scope of an application. The effort here is pretty large.
