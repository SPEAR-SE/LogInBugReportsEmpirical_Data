[thanks [~wilfreds] for reporting this, before YARN-5375, drainEvents did't grant really drain all the events, so there is a litte change to cause test failure. especially for RMRestart test which is using MemoryStateStore not MockMemoryStateStore. at this jira. I'll try to resolve RMRestart related test failure completely., [~sandflee] Post YARN-5375, we can solve these issues with new mem store implementation, correct?, yes. , Thanks. Could we handle TestRMRestart test cases modification related to YARN-5375 in this jira itself., [~sandflee] I was looking all the test failure JIRA yesterday after YARN-5375. Some of the observations are
# In MockRM, couple of waitFotState do not drain for events.  Ex: line no 322. This method is called from many tests. 
# some of the tests in YARN-4929 need to look again. , yes, I think there are two main places not drain Events:
1, explicitly using MemoryStateStore like most RMRestart test, we could resolve by using MockRMMemoryStateStore
2, using MockRM.waitForState in static way, we could explicitly add rm.drainEvents() before call MockRM.waitForState or change MockRM.waitForState from static to non-static. thought?

bq. some of the tests in YARN-4929 need to look again.
will do

, will do, Look like dupe if YARN-5548., [~sandflee]  this JIRA look like dupe of YARN-5548. Can we move the discussion over there? May be you can take over YARN-5548 since you have already worked in YARN-5375. cc:/[~bibinchundatt], I'm ok, close it with dup]
