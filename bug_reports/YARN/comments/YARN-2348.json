Properly set up servers typically have their time set to UTC.  Changing the display here will conflict with what is in the log files.  If you want to display a different locale on the Web UI, then it needs to be selectable., Allen suggestion of making selectable from the browser makes sense. 

In Oozie, we are doing this. Because JavaScript does not have built in libraries for TZ handling, what we did is:

* have request parameter that specifies the desired TZ for datetime values, default value is UTC.
* TZ conversion happens on the server side when producing the JSON output using the TZ request parameter.
* have a REST call that returns the list of available TZ.
* have a dropdown in the UI that shows the available TZs (uses the rest call from previous bullet)
* use a cookie to remember the user selected TZ
* if the cookie is present, set the TZ request parameter with it.

, -1 on the patch as is. I could stomach an option in the browser. Perhaps a javascript lib needs to be included. But changing the timezones on the server side is fraught with problems., Please find the new patch to this issue in YARN-2348.2.patch. 

In this patch, resourcemanager server will format the date of Start/FinisheTime first, instead of rendering date in browser., Here are the new snapshots of Web UI of my cluster before/after the patch. , Hi [~aw] [~tucu00] [~raviprak] , thanks for your comments. I agree with you that the Web UI should display the time just the same as the server side. Please have a check of the new patch, thanks!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., In this updated patch, the formatted StartTime and FinishTime are returned to WebUI directly, instead of rendering the 'long' date type at WebUI. 

Meanwhile, date format should change to "yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss z", so that 'sort' on StartTime/FinishTime are correct., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Managing clusters which may perhaps be in different timezones requires that all clusters share the same time zone. UTC was chosen for this reason and is quite widely accepted as the industry standard now., YARN-570 changes the UI so that times are displayed in the timezone according to the viewing browser.  I'm not sure if this JIRA is asking for something new/different.]
