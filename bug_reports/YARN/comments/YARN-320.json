[Proposed minimal change that fakes out the renewer.  If the RM is talking to itself (RPC UGI matches login UGI), then it will claim the renewer is renewing the token.

This also has the benefit of allowing the client to request a RM token that either it or a designated user can externally renew.  Whereas today it's either the RM renews or someone else, but not both.

It's been manually tested but I'll try to write unit tests and submit if this approach is ok., Seems ok. Is the additional bit to extract the renewer from the token required ? Maybe we can avoid RPC all together for such tokens (issues by the same RM)., Admittedly, extracting the renewer is a bit dubious.  It was the simplest way to satisfy the ADTSM checks w/o making changes to the core that would have a larger impact.

In 1.x I tried to make the JT not do a lookback RPC to itself, but I don't recall why it was dinged.  With the current design I'm not sure there's a good way for the token to get access to the RM's secret manager, but yes that would be ideal.
