[Added unit test and tested manually , Manual test consisted of 
a) Configure yarn to use fair scheduler
b) Create hierarchical queue in fair-scheduler.xml
c) Try to run a job assigned to a parent queue.

Without the fix Resource manager would terminate with the exception in fair scheduler.
With the fix the job submission is rejected with an error and Resource manager continues running., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The test failure is obviously unrelated - it says "java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException: libhadoop cannot be loaded.". We should discuss it on another JIRA. [~sandyr], can you take a look?, Thanks for picking this up Anubhav.

A couple nits:
* In the test, writing out the xml file can be avoided.  scheduler.getQueueManager().getLeafQueue("parent.child.granchild1", true) will create the queue and its parents.
* If an app is rejected in this way, "Application rejected by queue placement policy" will be printed out, which is not entirely accurate.  I'm not sure what the cleanest way to fix this, but perhaps either merging assignAppToQueue into addApplication or getLeafQueue could throw an exception that gets caught in addApplication.
* "Cannot find queue named " + queueName + " or its not a leaf queue".  This won't occur when the queue can't be found, only when it can't exist as a leaf queue given the current hierarchy.  Also, need an apostrophe in the "it's".

, [~adhoot] is out on vacation. Posting a patch that addresses Sandy's comments. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
