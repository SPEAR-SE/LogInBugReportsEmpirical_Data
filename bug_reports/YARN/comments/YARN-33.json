[Working on it , I have a patch. Testing it.

Thanks,
Mayank, Attaching the patch for trunk

Thanks,
Mayank, Mayank, tx for you patch, I have few comments.
 - {{yarn.nodemanager.local-dirs}} is expected to be list of directories on local FS. So either we
  -- altogether reject URIs and only accept simple file-paths
  -- or preferably accept URIs, but validate that they have either no scheme or a "file:///" scheme.
 - Also with your patch, when someone gives a file:// uri, the error isn't propagated correctly. So how about moving the checks up to {{LocalDirsHandlerService.init()}} just before {{checkDirs()}}?, Thanks Vinod for your comments. Updating patch.

Thanks,
Mayank, Couple of comments on the patch.

- I think it's better to fail early, rather than silently running a system with fewer disks than intended. In this case, we should generate errors instead of ignoring the badly configured dirs, or count the bad dirs towards unhealthy disks. Thoughts ?
- The unit test doesn't really belong to TestDirectoryCollection. It can be in a separate class - something like TestLocalDirsHandlerService. Also I don't think the test needs to attempt deleting any files. Just verifying the number of dirs / expected dirs should be sufficient.
- Additional unit tests, which verify alternate schems are handled as they should be., Hi Sid,

Thanks for the review.

I think its reasonable for the log/local dirs because people may have added multiple but if one of them is good we should be able to make cluster functioning and with the error message in the log that following disks are in bad shape.
Thoughts?

, bq. I think we already do that right now. We have functions which removes the unhealthy log dirs and local dirs from the list. I followed the same model. I think its reasonable for the log/local dirs because people may have added multiple but if one of them is good we should be able to make cluster functioning and with the error message in the log that following disks are in bad shape.
These dirs are removed directly from the initial list (as against the initial list containing all configured dirs). They don't count towards bad disks, and the node health calculation. 
, Thanks Sid for the review comments. I have incorporated all of those. Please take a look.

Thanks,
Mayank, The intention of the patch is to prevent the NM from starting up in case of mis-configured dirs. I think this is a better approach, since incorrect dirs is likely to be an accidental configuration error.

The patch itself needs one fix.
LocalDirsHandlerService.init should not be suppressing the exception from MonitoringTimerTask. In it's current form, this ends up getting interpreted as a valid initialization.  
, Thanks Sid for the review. 
Good Point, Incorporated that.

This indicates an invalid URI as well - and shouldn't be ignored., Thanks Sid for the review. Updated the patch with your comments and fixed the broken testcase.
