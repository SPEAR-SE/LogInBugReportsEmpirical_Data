[Sandy, I am not sure about this one. I would expect memory total to captured to total amount of memory in the cluster, and so be more or less a constant (not fluctuation due to reservations). I am not 100% sure, but I think that for the CapacityScheduler reservations count against availableMB, so it works fine as-is. Am I missing something?, Agreed that memory total should be the total amount of memory in the cluster.  In the fair scheduler, and I'm pretty sure the capacity scheduler as well, a reservation is a promise that the next time resources on a certain node free up, they will go to a particular application.  The purpose of these is to prevent larger container requests from starving.  So it doesn't really make sense to subtract these from availableMB, because they overlap with allocatedMB., I haven't seen this problem happening with the CapacityScheduler (but I was not looking for it, so I might just have missed it).
In the CapacityScheduler reservation count against your capacity, but you might be right that they are not counted in the metrics.

, Note this broke the UI, at least for the capacity scheduler.

It now displays total that is lacking the reserved.   Perhaps this is a difference in how fair scheduler and capacity scheduler keep track of allocated vs reservations.]
