[Added a registration check for yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb and yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-vcores.
If NM request does't satisfy minimum allocations, RM returns NodeAction.SHUTDOWN., Kenji, the patch looks good to me. A couple of nits to address:
 - Wrap around lines longer than 80 characters.
 - Use BuilderUtils.newResource() to generate Resource objects in MockNM and TestResourceTrackerService., Wrapped lines and fixed to use BuilderUtils.
I also changed to use BuilderUtils generating NodeId. Is it Needless?

This message is automatically generated., Apologies for missing these earlier:
 - Reading from config for every node registration *can* be expensive, can you read the min allocation values as part of init() and store them in class variables and then use them?
 - There's a typo in ResourceTrackerService log message : does't., Sure. No problem.
Added private variables and moved reading conf to init. Also fixed typo.

In cases like these, it is useful to show such info on RM web app - filed YARN-623., I just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Kenji!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3685 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3685/])
