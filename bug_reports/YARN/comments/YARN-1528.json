This message is automatically generated., Can those helpers just go in ZKUtil?  LGTM otherwise., The configs are YARN specific, will have to send the config names across if we move them to ZKUtil. Also, I see more RM-specific ZK-util methods being added to this new class. , I meant more util methods being added in the future - zk connections, retries etc. for SharedCacheManager etc. , Ok, makes sense.  +1, Thanks for the review, Sandy. Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5243 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5243/])
