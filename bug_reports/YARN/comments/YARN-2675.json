This message is automatically generated., Minor: In ContainerImpl finished, it may be good to add a default case for which we log an error saying "unexpected state encountered, metrics may not be updated correctly" to catch issues like this in future
Otherwise LGTM., Hi [~adhoot],
 Good suggestion. I uploaded a new patch YARN-2675.002.patch to address your comment.
thanks

This message is automatically generated., I admit it's not caused by your patch, but the fact that we have to catch 'default' and log error without any action tells me this is broken.

I think we should dismantle the finished() method altogether and directly have separate transitions which sub-class ContainerDoneTransition and do the right thing w.r.t metrics for that specific transition. Can we do that here?, Hi [~vinodkv],

thanks for the review. Good suggestion. the new patch YARN-2675.003.patch addressed your comment.

  Are you ok with the new patch? The new patch passed Hadoop QA test.

thanks
zhihai, Can we add unit tests to exercise all the newly added transitions? Otherwise, the patch looks good. [~vinodkv] - do the changes look okay to you as well? , Hi [~kasha],

Good suggestion, I added unit tests to exercise all the newly added transitions in the new patch YARN-2675.004.patch.

This message is automatically generated., Given we split up all the cases of ContainerDoneTransition, do we still need it? , Although we don't use it in the state machine directly, it is the base class of all other added classes. So we still need it., bq. it is the base class of all other added classes
Never mind, I am not the brightest today. Forgot the child classes call super.transition. , The latest patch looks good, the findbugs warnings look unrelated.
