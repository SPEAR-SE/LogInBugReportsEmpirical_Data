[Hello [~rekha.dunna@gmail.com].  Are you possibly looking for the {{yarn.nodemanager.admin-env}} setting in yarn-site.xml?  Here is a copy-paste of the default as defined in yarn-default.xml:

{code}
  <property>
    <description>Environment variables that should be forwarded from the NodeManager's environment to the container's.</description>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.admin-env</name>
    <value>MALLOC_ARENA_MAX=$MALLOC_ARENA_MAX</value>
  </property>
{code}
