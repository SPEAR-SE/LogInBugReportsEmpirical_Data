[ I propose the following:
 - Rename the "domain" and "create" options to be "timeline_domain_id" and "should_create_timeline_domain" respectively.
 - Modify option description of view_acls and modify_acls to say that they are only needed if should_create_timeline_domain is true
 - Modify description of {{timeline_domain_id}} to say that it is optional and the it will use the "DEFAULT" timeline-domain by default
 - If {{should_create_timeline_domain}} is off, we should validate on the client to see if the domain really exists or not and fail the submission if not with a message saying "The passed timeline-domain doesn't exist. Either pass an existing timeline-domain_id or set  should_create_timeline_domain to true".
 - If {{should_create_timeline_domain}} is on, and the user passes an existing timeline-domain-id, we should fail the submission and say "The passed timeline-domain already exists. Either pass an new timeline-domain_id or set  should_create_timeline_domain to false", [~vinodkv], thanks for your proposal.

1. I prefer "create_timeline_domain" over "should_create_timeline_domain", as it is an option without arg. So there will not be true/false for it.

2. I'd like to enforce the validation logic (see the existing code comment). However, as we're lacking timeline client query APIs. It will involve more steps to send http requests and parse JSON response. I prefer to do it after YARN-2423.
{code}
    try {
      //TODO: we need to check and combine the existing timeline domain ACLs,
      //but let's do it once we have client java library to query domains.
      TimelineDomain domain = new TimelineDomain();
{code}

 - Given 2.6, we should deprecate the old options.
