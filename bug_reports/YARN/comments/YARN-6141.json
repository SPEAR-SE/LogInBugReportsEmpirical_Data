[This is working as expected; this isn't a cmake problem. This is either a compiler/header problem or a build-time configuration problem.  

Specifically, on Linux platforms:

{code}
#elif defined(__linux)


char* get_executable(char *argv0) {
  return __get_exec_readproc("/proc/self/exe");
}
{code}

should be getting triggered.  If it's not, then __linux isn't being defined.  If ppc64le on Linux is not defining __linux, then I'd say the compiler chain is broken.  If that is actually intentional, then supplemental code will need to be provided.  If it can't be provided, then container-executor.conf.dir needs to be defined on the maven command line to point to an absolute path where the container-executor.conf will be located post-installation., Thank you for the response. On checking, I found that __linux macro is not defined for C99 on ppc64le.

$ gcc -std=c99 -dM -E -xc /dev/null | grep linux
#define __linux__ 1
#define __gnu_linux__ 1

In the src/main/native/container-executor/impl/get_executable.c file, I changed the macro from  __linux to __linux__ (since this macro is predefined on ppc64le for C99).
I got a successful build with this change . Attached a patch file with the same. 
, On upgrading the version of cmake to >3.1 the build is successful. For cmake version < 3.1, the C standard is being set to c99 in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager/src/CMakeLists.txt:

{code:borderStyle=solid}
if (CMAKE_VERSION VERSION_LESS "3.1")
		  # subset of CMAKE_<LANG>_COMPILER_ID
		  # https://cmake.org/cmake/help/v3.0/variable/CMAKE_LANG_COMPILER_ID.html
		  if (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "GNU" OR
			  CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Clang" OR
			  CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "AppleClang")
			set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-std=c99 -Wall -pedantic-errors ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS}")
		  elseif (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "Intel")
			set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-std=c99 -Wall ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS}")
		  elseif (CMAKE_C_COMPILER_ID STREQUAL "SunPro")
			set (CMAKE_C_FLAGS "-xc99 ${CMAKE_C_FLAGS}")
		  endif ()
		else ()
		  set (CMAKE_C_STANDARD 99)
		endif ()
{code}
, The predefined macros "__linux" and "linux" are not POSIX-compliant (neither are unix and __unix ), so ppc64le is in the right here.  They are allowed with GNU extensions, but should not be allowed for strict ANSI, which is implied by -std=c99.  The Hadoop code should be changed to use the compliant __linux__ .

See https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/System-specific-Predefined-Macros.html#System-specific-Predefined-Macros for discussion and guidance.  In particular:

"We are slowly phasing out all predefined macros which are outside the reserved namespace. You should never use them in new programs, and we encourage you to correct older code to use the parallel macros whenever you find it."  Here the "parallel macros" are those with underscores both before and after the name, such as __linux__ .

I do not know why the POWER back end is the only one that enforces this, but that point is moot.  Hadoop code should be changed., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Any update on this ?, Any update on this ? , Any update ?, This was a build failure due to undefined macro on ppc64le platform. The patch resolves this issue and the build is successul. , [~aw] Any update on this ?, Any update here guys ?, What is the inhibitor here? 

As mentioned earlier, the __linux__ is recommended by gcc community. https://gcc.gnu.org/onlinedocs/cpp/System-specific-Predefined-Macros.html#System-specific-Predefined-Macros
Going forward this is going to be the future standard.
This patch won't break any platform but just complying to the standards.

, Any update here ?
