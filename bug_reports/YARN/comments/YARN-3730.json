[hi [~gu chi], 
Which version did you find this problem ? If its below 2.6.0, please test with the latest as there have been some improvements wrt to reservation in YARN-1769. If its with 2.6.0 and above version, share some RM logs with debug enabled, so that we can do further analysis., Thx Naga, as improvements r not merged to my current using version, so this feature is not invoked, will set "yarn.scheduler.capacity.reservations-continue-look-all-nodes" to false on version 2.7.0 and check the outcome.]
