[This happens when NM is down but RM hasn't yet found out that it is down i.e. NM expiry hasn't happened?, [~varun_saxena], There are 2 cases  when NM becomes inaccessible, 
# AMLivelinessMonitor expires the AM when launching of AM by AMlauncher is successfull but NM goes down by the time AM process is started 
# AM container is allocated to a Node and later when the NM becomes unhealthy (abrupt shutdown) then AMLauncher fails to connect to NM and launch the container.

Earlier allocation to the same NM (before NMLivelinessMonitor expires the NM) is rarely possible(cases where NM is facing transient failure) as scheduling to the node happens only on hearbeat but with advent of Global Scheduling we will come across it more often !
