Would you fix org.apache.hadoop.yarn.factory.providers package also? I found the following packages should be fixed as well.
* org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util
* org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api.impl
* org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api, [~ajisakaa] updated the patch..kindly review., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~brahmareddy], thank you for updating the patch.

bq. o.a.h.yarn.client.api.impl

hadoop-yarn-client module has more o.a.h.yarn.client.api.impl classes than hadoop-yarn-common, so would you remove the annotation from the package-info.java in hadoop-yarn-common? I'm +1 if that is addressed., [~ajisakaa] Thanks a lot for review.. KIndly the review the updated patch.., \\
