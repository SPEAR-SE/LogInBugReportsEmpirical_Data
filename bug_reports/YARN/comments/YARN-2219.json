[Thanks for reporting this, Ashwin! 
This is actually a bug. we should synchronously add application/attempt to scheduler which [~vinodkv] also brought this up offline. assign to myself., The problem is that scheduler application/attempt may not be created when app re-registers.

Patch to add scheduler application/attempt synchronously on recovery.
Also changed to not send duplicate AppAccepted event on recovery., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This seems fine. Couple of suggestions
 - Add a java comment in RMAppAttemptImpl that we are sending it synchronously and why we are doing it.
 - instead of the shouldNotifyAppAccepted nomenclature, we can say isAppRecovering and flip the logic - that's more intuitive
  - testRecoverSchedulerAppAndAttemptSynchrnously -> typo Synchronously
 - Can we also test the successful transfer of containers to prove that this bug is a point-fix too?
 - In addition, I think the same bug can occur on the node-side - we may be silently ignoring them as unknown containers when scheduler doesn't know about them, can we validate that too?, Fixing the title to imply more than a test-issue.., Fixed the comments
bq. instead of the shouldNotifyAppAccepted nomenclature, we can say isAppRecovering and flip the logic 
Updated the naming for attempt also to be consistent.  , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
