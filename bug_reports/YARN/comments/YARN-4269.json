This message was automatically generated., So this just logs, correct? Is that what we want?, [~lichangleo]
{{IOUtils#cleanup}} can be used rt?, [~steve_l], yes, this only help log when close fail. It will be good to have this log to notice us something could go wrong with log aggregation.
[~bibinchundatt], cleanup only log in debug mode, so I create closeStream to log close failure in info.
, upload .2 patch to address javadoc and whitespace issue, \\

This message was automatically generated., -1.

Javadocs say "logs at debug level and log can be null". Neither of those hold, [~stevel@apache.org], thanks for pointing out the discrepancy. Have updated the javadoc in .3 patch., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~stevel@apache.org], do you still have objection to the latest patch?, Hey [~lichangleo] - It appears the patch no longer applies cleanly to trunk. 

I also see that {{IOUtils#cleanup}} almost meets your needs, but catches the wrong exception and logs at the wrong priority. Given this, I would prefer an overloaded version of {{IOUtils#cleanup}} vs {{IOUtils#closeStream}}. You could pass in the exception class and log priority and refactor the existing {{IOUtils#cleanup}}. What do you think?, Thanks for taking a look at this jira [~shanekumpf@gmail.com]. I think it's not straight forward to pass in the log priority since we are using a Log interface not some specific log like log4j, Thanks for the quick response [~lichangleo]. I can understand the hesitation to create an enum specifically for this. SO what if {{IOUtils.cleanup}} logged to info vs debug, it seems that would fix this as well, correct?]
