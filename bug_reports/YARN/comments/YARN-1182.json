This message is automatically generated., Nit:
{code}
+        conf.set(YarnConfiguration.RM_ADMIN_ADDRESS, hostname + ":0");
+        conf.set(YarnConfiguration.RM_SCHEDULER_ADDRESS, hostname + ":0");
+        conf.set(YarnConfiguration.RM_RESOURCE_TRACKER_ADDRESS, hostname + ":0");
+        WebAppUtils.setRMWebAppHostnameAndPort(getConfig(), hostname, 0);
{code}
getConfig() should be replaced with conf on the last line, right?

Otherwise LGTM, Thanks for the review, Sandy. Here is an updated patch that fixes that.

For sanity, I ran all tests under hadoop-mapreduce-project and the change doesn't introduce any test failures., +1, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
