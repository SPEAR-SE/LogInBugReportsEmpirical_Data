[Attaching the patch., The right fix may be moving the FS operations to serviceStart(). See the similar code in FileSystemRMStateStore:
{code}
  @Override
  protected synchronized void startInternal() throws Exception {
    // create filesystem only now, as part of service-start. By this time, RM is
    // authenticated with kerberos so we are good to create a file-system
    // handle.
    Configuration conf = new Configuration(getConfig());
    conf.setBoolean("dfs.client.retry.policy.enabled", true);
    String retryPolicy =
        conf.get(YarnConfiguration.FS_RM_STATE_STORE_RETRY_POLICY_SPEC,
          YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_FS_RM_STATE_STORE_RETRY_POLICY_SPEC);
    conf.set("dfs.client.retry.policy.spec", retryPolicy);

    fs = fsWorkingPath.getFileSystem(conf);
    fs.mkdirs(rmDTSecretManagerRoot);
    fs.mkdirs(rmAppRoot);
    fs.mkdirs(amrmTokenSecretManagerRoot);
  }
{code}

BTW, we're thinking about removing the old application history store stack (YARN-2320)., I can see this both ways. It seems to correct to login during initialization and and to wait until start to do file operations. Although a fix to either one of them does indeed fix the issue at hand., [~jeagles], I saw doSecureLogin is invoked at start stage in both RM and NM, and I'm a bit concerned that moving it to init will cause some unexpected behavior. Do you have any idea about the rationale behind this choice? I'm not aware of it before., Thanks for the the suggestion [~zjshen]. Moving the FS operations to serviceStart() will work too. But I went with this option as to me, doing a login during initialization makes more sense than it be on the mid-way., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I don't have any context why login is part of start. , Talk to vinod offline shortly. It seems that the YARN daemons are supposed to make external calls until start stage., I see. Thanks for the info. I did not know about that.
