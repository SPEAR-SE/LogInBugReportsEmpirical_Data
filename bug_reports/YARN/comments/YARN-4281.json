This message was automatically generated., Marking this a blocker for 2.7.2, just like YARN-3544 was a blocker originally., The intent is to bring this code better inline with what's happening on branch-2, now that YARN-3248 was committed to branch-2.7 (and broke the RM UI as a result).  As such I have a few whitespace nits on the patch which when fixed should help remove some potentials for merge conflicts when cherry-picking other changes from branch-2.  For reference I was diffing the patched version of AppBlock.java and RMAppBlock.java against commit c9ee316045b83b18cb068aa4de739a1f4b50f02a which is where YARN-3544 went into branch-2.  Any diffs that don't belong to another commit delta between branch-2 and branch-2.7 are what's flagged below.

For this patch hunk, the original YARN-3248 did not have the appReport = null line, just the appReport declaration.  Also there's an additional whitespace line that was added by this patch which should not be there:

This message was automatically generated., There's still extra whitespace added by this deletion (note it doesn't delete one of the lines around the block deleted, resulting in the extra whitespace):

This message was automatically generated., +1, committing this., Thanks, Chang!  I committed this to branch-2.7., Hi [~lichangleo] and [~jlowe], does branch-2.6 has the same issue? If so, we may consider to backport the fix to branch-2.6 also?, Using 2.6.4, I tried visiting the RM app page of both a live app and a completed application and both worked just fine.  So it doesn't appear that this is needed for branch-2.6., Ok. Thanks for the confirmation, Jason!]
