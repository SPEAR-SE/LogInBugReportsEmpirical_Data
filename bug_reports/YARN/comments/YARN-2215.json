[Hi [~leftnoteasy], I found "Resource Preempted from Current Attempt" and "Number of Non-AM Containers Preempted from Current Attempt" in Web UI are not implemented in REST apps api.
For api consistency, I think REST should have same elements. Please comment if you have interest, Thanks., Hi [~kj-ki],
Thanks for working on this, I've assigned this JIRA to you. 
I think the fields you added should be fine. With the scope of this JIRA, I think it's better to add CLI support as well. Please submit patch to kickoff jenkins when you completed.

, Thanks for comments, [~leftnoteasy].
I will also make a patch for CLI support, but it does't depend on REST's dao. To make it clear, may I divide jira into REST support and CLI support?, [~kj-ki],
Sorry I missed your latest comment, I think this is still needed. It's fine to split to two separated JIRA. Updating description/title.

Two comments:
- I found in your patch only handled RMAppAttemptMetrics, RMAppMetrics also need to be handled. 
- RMAppAttemptMetrics should in AppAttemptInfo and RMAppMetrics should in AppInfo.

Make sense?]
