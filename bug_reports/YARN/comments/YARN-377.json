[Sorry, didn't see this when I filed YARN-388.  Any ETA on this?  If it's coming shortly then we can dup that JIRA to this, otherwise would like to get the test failure fixed soon.  (Or I can put up a patch for fixing the humanReadableInt calls from the containers monitor., Hi, Jason.  I'm expecting to work on this later today.  Your current patch for {{TestContainersMonitor}} on YARN-388 is exactly what I had in mind.  We could either put all of the work (test fix + deprecation fixes) on this jira, or if you'd rather not wait, then I can go +1 YARN-388 right now so that you can commit the test fix part of it right away.

Just let me know what works best for you.  Thanks!
, If the total fix is coming real soon, then no worries let's just do it in this JIRA.  Thanks!, This patch updates {{ContainersMonitorImpl}} to stop using the recently deprecated {{StringUtils#humanReadableInt}} and updates the regex in {{TestContainersMonitor}} to match the new format.  Just to be safe, I made the regex flexible enough to match any prefix that could be returned from {{StringUtils#TraditionalBinaryPrefix#long2String}}, even though we're unlikely to see memory usage measured in the exabytes on our dev machines.  :-), {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., In formatUsageString, it uses lower case 'b' for byte, could you change it to upper case 'B'?  Otherwise, "Mb" does not look good.  We also need to change the test accordingly., Thank you, Nicholas.  Here is version 2 of the patch, switching to upper-case 'B'.  Since we're making a commitment to upper-case output, I simplified the test regex to check only for upper-case letters., +1 patch looks good., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
