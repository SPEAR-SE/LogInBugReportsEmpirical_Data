This message is automatically generated., Tx for the patch Varun! Marking it for 2.4 as it seems like a bad bug.

The patch looks fine overall. But the test isn't useful much. TestRMAppTransitions and similar tests are basic unit-tests that don't uncover a lot of bugs that happen during integration. You should imitate TestRMRestart.testQueueMetricsOnRMRestart() without the restart part- that should be a fine balance between a unit test, integration test and a real life setup of starting clusters., Updated patch with modified test in TestRM which tests the queue metrics., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
