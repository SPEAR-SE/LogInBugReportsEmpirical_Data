This message is automatically generated., Tx for working on this, do you mind doing this also for WebAppProxyServer.java and JobHistoryServer.java - the only other two servers which don't support generic opts?

IAC, I couldn't see what the findbugs warning was; the result is gone. Please rerun the patch through Jenkins if/when you update the patch., Added {{GenericOptionsParser}} to {{WebAppProxyServer}} and {{JobHistoryServer}}.
Checked other builds on the findbugs issue. Looks like all of them report 5 new findbugs warnings. Something with the build I guess.
TestAllocationFileLoaderService is passing locally.
