[Hi [~asuresh]
Thanks for filing the ticket.

I have some doubts. Currently scheduler sends preempted container details (message) to AM via heartbeat. And I could see that we update preemption details into PreemptionMessage as StrictContract and normal contract.
Any specific advantages for clients to know about such message. Because AM can take some action based on its loaded for preemption policy such as check point etc. May be I am missing something, pls help me to share some more information.]
