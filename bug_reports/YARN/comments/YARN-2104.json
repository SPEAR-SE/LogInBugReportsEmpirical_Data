Worked for us. And the failed unit test seems irrelevant., +1 lgtm.  The test failure is unrelated.  Committing this., Thanks Wangda!  And thanks Maysam for the review.

, Hi [~wangda],
This issues still happens for FairScheduler(in trunk) but not CapacityScheduler. Can you please check ?
Steps to reproduce :
1. Run an app in default queue.
2. While the app is running, go to the scheduler page on RM UI.
3. You would see the app in the apptable at the bottom.
4. Now click default queue to filter the apptable on queue name.
5. App disappears from apptable although it is running on default queue., Created YARN-2540 and posted a patch to fix this issue in fair scheduler., [~ashwinshankar77],
Sorry to reply late, it will be good to have a fix on FS also, thanks!
