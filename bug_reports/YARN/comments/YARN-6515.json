[Attaching a patch with the fixes.
Issue #3 : Not sure why DockerContainerImpl is using hard coded cgroup mount path, hope [~sidharta-s] can have a look at it.
Issue #5 : Seems to be introduced in YARN-4597, [~asuresh] can you take a look at it, though IMO it can be safely removed., Hi [~Naganarasimha]

There is an umbrella jira HADOOP-14336 to fix all findbugs warnings since switched to spotbugs, I was working on the one for yarn HADOOP-14338. There were total 18 warnings in yarn components. Do you want to track them all in HADOOP-14338 or split them for each component like this one?, Hi [~cheersyang],
IMO i  would suggest to split based on project so that its simpler to handle (and refer when there is findbugs failures elsewhere) and also it should have been YARN jira instead of HADOOP jira and may be we could have linked it under the umbrella HADOOP-14336 . Thoughts ?, Hi [~Naganarasimha]

I personally have no problem with that. But since there is an umbrella JIRA, could you please move this one under that? I have a patch for all components, but I can split them up to fix rest of yarn components if you like. Thank you for the quick response., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Hi [~cheersyang],
bq.  I have a patch for all components, but I can split them up to fix rest of yarn components if you like
Agree you can split and hope you dont mind as i have already raised and fixed for NM, As I was mentioning earlier its better to fix per project, as the reports are generated per project.

bq. I personally have no problem with that. But since there is an umbrella JIRA, could you please move this one under that?
These find bugs jira should have been under YARN jira, so IIUC we can not make a YARN jira a sub task under HADOOP Jira. If possible i am fine with it, else we can make this jira related to  HADOOP-14336 . Thoughts ? 
, Hi [~Naganarasimha]

Can you reply the email sent by [~ajisakaa] in which he mentioned the umbrella jiar? I am OK with either way, as long as there is a place for me to attach my patches :).
, bq. These find bugs jira should have been under YARN jira, so IIUC we can not make a YARN jira a sub task under HADOOP Jira. If possible i am fine with it, else we can make this jira related to HADOOP-14336 .

I prefer making this type of jiras to be in YARN project and related to HADOOP-14336. Thanks., Thanks for the confirmation [~ajisakaa], will updated it as related to HADOOP-14336 ., As discussed with [~cheersyang] and [~ajisakaa], we will split YARN find bugs issue into multiple per project yarn jiras.  As this would be easier in tracking and  discussion.
[~cheersyang], please raise and upload patches for other YARN and MR projects., Thanks [~Naganarasimha] and [~ajisakaa], I am going to create several JIRAs per yarn component (like this one), then split the patch in HADOOP-14338 and attach to each of them. Thank you all for the comments., Revised the title a bit for consistency :), | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Mostly looks good to me.

+            CGROUPS_ROOT_DIRECTORY);

{code}
I'm thinking this patch changes the existing behavior. What do you think?, Thanks [~ajisakaa],
but the point which is made by the find bugs is valid and we should not go by fixed *cgroups* mount folder which is currently being used. Wanted some clarification from the owners of {{DockerLinuxContainerRuntime}}. cc/ [~sidharta-s], hope to get some clarification on this

One alternative is to open separate ticket for the same, but anyways would like to wait till he responds., Thank you,  [~ajisakaa] for raising this issue. [~Naganarasimha], if we do this cgroups change, I think we need to update the documentation in NodemanagerCgroups.md. So far this configuration was used just in the context of yarn.nodemanager.linux-container-executor.cgroups.mount=true. yarn-default.xml is another candidate. Also, the location inside the container might still need to be hard coded or configured by a separate entry to support isolation better., Thanks [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] for pitching in,
Agree may be my fix is not correct and requires update in multiple places or even cause change in behavior. IIUC it is not correct to use hard coded path in *DockerLinuxContainerRuntime*, but not sure will it cause any impact. 
bq. Also, the location inside the container might still need to be hard coded or configured by a separate entry to support isolation better.
you mean docker container here right ? May be i am not completely aware of how this {{"CGROUPS_ROOT_DIRECTORY"}} is used by the docker container. So please suggest should we need to handle as a separate configuration entry ?, Thank you [~Naganarasimha] and [~ajisakaa] for bringing up the cgroup mount path hardcode issue. 

I agree with [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] that using YarnConfiguration.NM_LINUX_CONTAINER_CGROUPS_MOUNT_PATH will require a documentation update due to the explicit wording of when it used. However, the setting does seem to be appropriate for this use and I think introducing a new configuration would be superfluous.

It would be good to remove the CGROUPS_ROOT_DIRECTORY variable all together and add a default value  to YarnConfiguration ("/sys/fs/cgroup" to maintain backward compatibility). This will require an update to TestDockerContainerRuntime as well.

{quote} Also, the location inside the container might still need to be hard coded or configured by a separate entry to support isolation better.{quote}

IMO, I don't think we should change behavior here and allow the mount point in the container to differ from the source (i.e. /sys/fs/cgroup should be bind mounted at /sys/fs/cgroup in the container, as we do today). I believe we can remove this automatic cgroup mount and address the need for different src/dest paths once YARN-5534 is in., Thank you, [~shanekumpf@gmail.com] for the explanation.
bq. Also, the location inside the container might still need to be hard coded or configured by a separate entry to support isolation better.
[~naganarasimha_gr@apache.org], yes I am talking about the Docker container here.
A little bit off topic but I am now curious, what is the point overriding the cgroups directory mounted by Docker in the worker containers?
If I create a centos6.7 Docker container on centos7, I see overlapping IDs in the two cgroups folders, that does no good I think and it will cause confusion in the future:
host:
{code}
[root@miklos-dev2 ~]# cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/tasks
1
2
3
5
7
8
9
...
26938
root         1     0  0 09:55 ?        00:00:03 /usr/lib/systemd/systemd --system --deserialize 22
{code}
container:
{code}
/ # cat /sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/tasks 
1
9
    1 root       0:00 sh
{code}
, {quote}
what is the point overriding the cgroups directory mounted by Docker in the worker containers?
{quote}

Thanks for bringing that up [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]. At the time, I believe it was required to allow systemd to run inside the containers. That overlap is confusing and likely not the behavior wanted/anticipated., Thank you for the response [~shanekumpf@gmail.com]. In this case I think I would also add this as a comment to the mount code, if we keep it for now., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Sorry for keeping this jira pending since a long time, was not sure whether to go ahead with the fix for the find bug report in DockerLinuxContainerRuntime. To proceed for other issues i have uploaded a patch excluding it.
[~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com], would you mind handling the findbug issue in {{DockerLinuxContainerRuntime}} in YARN-6757 or new jira?

, Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for the comment and the patch. +1., Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for the updated patch. With regard to the hard coded cgroup path in DLCR, I am fine with leaving it off this patch. The hard coded mount (and path) will be removed after YARN-5534 is in. The rest looks good to me, +1., Thanks [~Naganarasimha], I created YARN-6968 for the Docker issue., Committed this to trunk. Thanks all who contributed to this issue., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #12152 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/12152/])
