, I think a RW lock is a little heavy here.  [~kasha] has some factoid about how a RW lock is actually slower than normal synchronization in low-demand scenarios.  Can we just synchronize on an Object?, Good catch, by the way!, Thanks [~templedf] for the review.
You are correct. Javadoc of ReentrantReadWriteLock suggests the same as well. 

Will change to synchronizing on an object., +1 on the latest patch, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, TestRMRestart test failure to be tracked by YARN-5548, Thanks [~varun_saxena] for the patch,
Yes the access to {{RMContextImpl.getHAServiceState()}} though done in multiple places, it seems to be not as critical flows like Heartbeat, so though initially offline i suggested to use RW locks, simple locking looks fine.
Overall patch LGTM, +1, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10895 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10895/])

, Is this issue fixed and reopened for any purpose? I see corresponding commit with this JIRA description and got reverted., Hi [~rohithsharma], 
Sorry my bad, i had wrongly committed changes of YARN-5572, with this jira id and title, hence had to revert and recommit.
Is there are any other better way to handle it (like modify only the commit message using ??"git commit --amend"??) without much impact ? As i was not sure I did revert.

Any way this jira is also ready to be committed (thats where the confusion started :( ) , will commit it by end of today !
, oh.. that's fine. I am not sure about impact of using --amend. May be some kind of documentation for committers like FAQ would be good in wiki. , SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10942 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10942/])
