[To prevent assign multiple from placing too many containers on any one node, you can either set the max assign, or you can turn on dynamic assignment., Closing as not an issue because it's the intentional design of fair scheduler, and there are documented approaches to mitigate the problem., [~templedf] Thank templedf. But it was a very difficult choice for us: 
* Turning on the dynamic assignment will cause the same resource consumption type of container placed on one node.
* Turning off the dynamic assignment will lead to very bad scheduling performance.

So, I want the fair scheduler to support turn on multi assignments, but each time the resource is allocated to a different application.
What do you think?, [~balloons], this is not a problem of multi assignment. You are basically asking for anti-affinity. Please check YARN-1042 (add ability to specify affinity/anti-affinity in container requests)., Thanks [~yufeigu],  the *YARN-1042* issue can completely solve my problem.]
