, Jenkins build looks to be done incorrectly by some reason: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/9652/
Kicked another Jenkins build: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/9654/, +1, I'd like to raise the priority to major because the configuration does not work if users copy-and-paste the wrong parameter. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.7, and branch-2.6. Thanks [~anthony@cloudera.com] for the contribution and thanks [~ozawa] for reviewing the patches., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8790 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8790/])

, Attaching the patch used for branch-2.7 and branch-2.6. 
{{yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.max-disk-utilization-per-disk-percentage}} was introduced by YARN-4176 and the property does not exist in branch-2.7 or branch-2.6, so I rebased the patch.
