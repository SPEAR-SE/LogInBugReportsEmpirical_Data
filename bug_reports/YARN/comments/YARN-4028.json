In {{RMAppImpl}} during recovery diagnostics is set as below

{{RMAppImpl#recover(RMState state)}}
{code}
this.diagnostics.append(appState.getDiagnostics());
{code}
So null gets appended to diagnostics;
AppBlock checks for null but value is string 'null'
, Attaching patch for review after handling both the issues, \\
