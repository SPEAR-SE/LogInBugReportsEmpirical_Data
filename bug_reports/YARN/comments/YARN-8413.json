[Setting async to false means that the statement you are calling has to complete before the next statement in your function can be called. If you set async: true then that statement will begin it's execution and the next statement will be called regardless of whether the async statement has completed yet.

The statement we look here is to be sync. Hence marking it as false. Attached v1 patch.
