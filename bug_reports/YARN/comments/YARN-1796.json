[Simple patch attached to relax the mode check in the container-executor. This patch also takes the liberty of fixing an inaccurate code comment that was nearby., I think I originally did that code in 1.x and 2.x. I know we were being excessively paranoid, but I haven't seen a reason why it should be opened up either. Where is the problem as it exists today?, I want to change it for the same reason we changed it for the LTC in MAPREDUCE-2103: because it doesn't serve any real purpose and is counter to the debian packaging policy manual. In addition, since the LTC is already this way, it's unfortunate to have the asymmetry between in permissions requirements between the two binaries, which makes documentation on the subject more confusing., [~vinodkv] - are you OK with this change?, Not sure why being counter to the debian packaging policy manual is necessarily wrong. Those are just guidelines.

IAC, it doesn't matter either ways. I neither see any inconvenience with what is present nor see a problem with changing it to not require these strict permissions.
