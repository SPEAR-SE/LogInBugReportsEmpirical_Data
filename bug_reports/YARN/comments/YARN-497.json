This message is automatically generated., No tests as just a pom file change., +1. Thanks! Perhaps its a good time to rename this to UnmanagedYarnClient or something since it does work similar to YarnClient that launches managed AM's., @Bikas, I think UnmanagedAMLauncher is more clear as yarn client today is a library used by other applications to write their clients. UnmanagedYarnClient brings out a completely different meaning., Committed to trunk and branch-2, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3523 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3523/])
