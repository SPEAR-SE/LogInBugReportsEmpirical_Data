[Here is what I tested in my {{mapred-site.xml}}:

{code}
  <property>
    <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts</name>
    <value>-Xmx1024m -verbose:gc -Xloggc:/tmp/mr-am-@taskid@.gc</value>
  </property>
{code}

The resulting GC log file was /tmp/mr-am-@taskid@.gc with no substitution.

This feature does work correctly inside the {{mapred.child.java.opts}} property for map and reduce task processes.  I only see the problem with {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts}}.

Either there is a bug, which would require a code fix, or the feature isn't really supported for the AM, which would require a documentation fix.  I would prefer that we do support replacement using the unique application ID, because it would be handy to separate GC logs and other things for the AM just like we do for the map and reduce tasks.
, As I see code, there is no validation for replacing @taskid@. Looks description for "yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts" is directly copied from mapred.child.java.opts.
, This issue fix to be done from Yarn framework at the time of lauching master container, so need to move issue to Yarn., Attaching patch for replacement of @appid@ in am.command_opts. @appid@ is replaced with app attempt id.]
