[Observation 
=========
Logs shown below are when Cluster node labels are not available in RM

2015-09-02 10:21:02,766 ERROR org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NodeStatusUpdaterImpl: Node Labels {1} reported from NM with ID host-<HOSTNAME>:64318 was rejected from RM with exception message as : Not all labels being replaced contained by known label collections,
please check, new labels=[1]
{code}

# On restart of NM its updating fine
# Looks like once failure happens NM not resending nodelabel status in heartbeat to RM
, Thanks for raising this issue [~bibinchundatt],
This issue is happening because we are trying to avoid sending labels everytime to RM as if sent everytime RM needs to validate it and refresh the Label mapping for each Node's HB and its a unnecessary overload @ RM side. 
So only  in this failure case, wherein the Labels are not accepted by RM then may be we can send the labels as part of each HB (or on periodic intervals) send the labels from NM to RM . Thoughts ? cc/ [~leftnoteasy], [~Naganarasimha], I think do the sync on periodic intervals seems reasonable to me. 

Maybe we can do this: when a label is not accepted by RM, it will retry every fetch-interval. If a label is accepted by RM, it won't resend unless labels updated in the node., Thanks for the thoughts [~leftnoteasy],
Initially we also thought of the same approach but only thing is: At design level NMDistributedNodeLabelsHandler just asks for labels from provider and AbstractNodeLabelsProvider  has the configuration of fetch-interval which periodically fetches the labels using the timer, so design wise would it be better to use the fetch-interval configuration in NMDistributedNodeLabelsHandler for only in the failure case ? or is it good to introduce some new configuration only for failure case here, thoughts ?, Hi [~leftnoteasy] & [~Naganarasimha]
Thanks a lot for looking into the issue and suggestion.

Attaching patch for review.
In case of failure currently have updared to send at an interval of 1 min
We can finalize which variable to use for setting.My opinion is {{DEFAULT_FETCH INTERVAL/3}}.If new conf need to be added can update too.

, Hi [~leftnoteasy]

Also checking distributed labels further found that Timer task is not getting triggers as expected.

In {{ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider#serviceInit}} {{startTime }} is getting set wrongly
{code}
    if (intervalTime != DISABLE_NODE_LABELS_PROVIDER_FETCH_TIMER) {
      startTime = new Date().getTime() + intervalTime;
    }
{code}
Need to remove the same.

[~Naganarasimha] have a look at the same will update patch further after your comments.., [~bibinchundatt],
Good catch, Basically this was added initially for testing and later removed but got missed over here so basically its sufficient that {{intervalTime}} itself is used as {{delay}} in {{AbstractNodeLabelsProvider.serviceStart}} and also we can remove {{startTime}} & in {{ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider.serviceInit}} we can remove {{startTime}} and instead of calling {{updateNodeLabelsFromConfig}} in {{serviceInit}} we can override and invoke {{timertask.run}} in {{serviceStart()}}. Please correct the test cases accordingly.
, [~Naganarasimha]

Thnks for comments and suggestion.
I have updated the patch as per your suggestion.
Please do review., \\

Thanks for update,
Some comments: 
- Not sure if I completely understand the logic. {{updateNodeLabelsFromConfig}} of {{ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider}} is invoked only when TimerTask scheduled. And TimerTask of AbstractNodeLabelsProvider delayed started for {{intervalTime}}. Does this mean we cannot get labels when initializing ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider? If so, I think we need to call updateNodeLabelsFromConfig in serviceInit of ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider. (Another choice is make the delay time from intervalTime to 0, but it runs in another thread, so the behavior is undetermined. To make it simple, I suggest to add it in serviceInit).
- Add a test for new behavior of this JIRA?, Thanks for the comments [~leftnoteasy],
bq. Does this mean we cannot get labels when initializing ConfigurationNodeLabelsProvider?
Actually {{timerTask.run();}} in {{serviceStart}} is responsible to fetch the labels for the very first time. Reason for this modification is, if some class extends this in future and forgets to set the labels during the start then it will be missed hence trying to take care of this in AbstractProvider class itself and secondly we cannot  choose {{intervalTime to 0}} because there is configuration that timer task need not run at all, so timer itself will not be created in this case, considering all this, he has modified as per the patch.
bq. Add a test for new behavior of this JIRA
Well for second issue  : i felt changes were related to the design level and scenarios are the same. only thing we have missed is to check whether the timer is triggered after the configured interval and the new labels are set, i think we can have one test case for this. Apart from this were you referring to the test case for first issue also ?
, [~leftnoteasy] Thnks for looking into the issue and [~Naganarasimha] for clearing first point.
Will try to update testcase for trigger check too. Testcases is working perfectly fine locally for me in eclipse.
i will recheck and update., Attaching patch after update of testcase., \\

Looks like not related to the patch uploaded.
Please do review., Thanks update [~bibinchundatt], and comments from [~Naganarasimha]. Few minor comments:

1) Make failLabelResendInterval to final before we can configure it.
2) testConfigTimer sleep time is too much, I don't know if Clock can be used in Timer, I think you can set NM_NODE_LABELS_PROVIDER_FETCH_INTERVAL_MS to lower value, like 1000, and sleep 1500 ms.
3) With changes in your patch, testNodeLabelsFromConfig doesn't need sleep any more?, Hi [~leftnoteasy]

bq. Wangda Tan As far as this patch its fine but was wondering to increase usability do we need to support YARN-2728, Support for disabling the Centralized NodeLabel validation in Distributed Node Label Configuration setup ?
Since we only support node partition, and node partition relates to capacity planning, etc. Without a centralized node partition collection, capacity planning will be not straightforward.

I think YARN-2728 makes more sense when we support node constraint., bq.  Without a centralized node partition collection, capacity planning will be not straightforward.
yes idea is to still have this collection but only difference being if the labels sent from NM is not present @ RM, then may be Labels Manager can support additional method which adds the missing labels first and then updates the mapping. thoughts?
Yes it makes more sense when we support node constraint, but if we want to support more flexibility then we can think of supporting this too., bq. ... may be Labels Manager can support additional method which adds the missing labels first and then updates the mapping
Doing this could be hard to manage: for example, how to deal with node label removal, you can do that when reference count of a label becomes zero, but resource request could be rejected if we remove a existing label. I would not prefer to add more flexibility to node partition, since it will likely break something., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8430 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8430/])
