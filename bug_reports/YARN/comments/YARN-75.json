[RMContainer now goes into a KILLED state in this situation. Would COMPLETED be a better state, since we don't really know the reason for the RELEASE. Does it make sense to differentiate between KILLED and COMPLETED in RMContainer (both being final states)., I think KILLED would be more appropriate then COMPLETED. COMPLETED would have been confusing in some cases.

Thanks,
Mayank, We also have an explicit RMContainerState.RELEASED state, for this.

Also, can you try and add a simple test using RM, MockNM and MockAM?, Uses the RELEASED state, and includes the unit test file which I missed adding last time., +1 looks good to me 

Thanks,
