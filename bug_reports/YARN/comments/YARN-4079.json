[This JIRA has been raised based on the discussion on YARN-3011 (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3011?focusedCommentId=14710000&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14710000). We can probably decide here if we want to handle it as above or not., cc [~djp], Thanks for filing this JIRA, [~varun_saxena].
bq. Probably we can read this value from configuration and set it to true in daemons if not configured. This way in production clusters if there is an exception which is leading to the daemon crashing frequently and we find that its unavoidable but not a very big issue(i.e daemon can still work normally for most part), we can atleast set the configuration to false in config file.
I don't mean to simply make this configuration public and allow user to specify false to disable exit-on-failure when exception happen. This could make things worse if critical exceptions happen but NMs/RM are still running as normal. We should think more on this., Hmm...I wasnt necessarily thinking of making it public. Just adding a way for it to be read from config so that it can be set to false if required(in rare scenarios) temporarily.
But is there something else we can do ?

Maybe we can add an exclusion list for which exceptions to be ignored. But the same exception might be a very critical bug in one area of code and not in other. So that may not be a viable alternative as well., Let us see what others think about how to handle this config.]
