[Could you please upload a patch. I can help to review., Hi [~sunilg], it is a small complement to node label document, please take a look. Thank you., Thanks, [~Ying Zhang], for the patch.  I can see that the new docs are styled after the add/modify docs, but it would be really nice to have docs that are reader-friendly.

For example, instead of "Remove cluster node labels: Executing {{yarn rmadmin -removeFromClusterNodeLabels "<label1,label2,label3>"}} (label splitted by ",") to remove node labels.", it would be nice to be a bit more readable, such as "To remove one or more node labels, execute the following command: {{yarn rmadmin -removeFromClusterNodeLabels "<label>[,<label>,...]"}}.  The command argument should be a comma-separated list of node labels to remove."

The rest of the bullets in the new docs can be made similarly more friendly by making them text instead of terse bullets., Hi [~templedf], thanks for the quick review. I did have followed the style of the add/modify section.:-)
