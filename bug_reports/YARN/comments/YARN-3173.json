[Setup RM HA also involve other manual steps, e.g. start ZK server, etc., so I am not sure how things proposed here help too much especially it need ssh login between active RM and standby RM. [~xgong], do you have any comments here?, This actually can be fixed if start-yarn uses some of the same tricks that start-dfs uses.  However, it's a lot easier with HADOOP-11565 committed., I'm going to close this as a dupe of HADOOP-11590.  I've got the requested functionality of starting HA RM nodes as part of that patch already.]
