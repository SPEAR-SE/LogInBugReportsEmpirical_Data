[This happens because this exception {{new IOException("Wait for ZKClient creation timed out");}} is not retried by upper level runWithRetries method which causes RM to fail.  we've seen quite a few issues regarding the retry logic of zk-store, YARN-2716 should be the long-term solution to fix all these.  In the interim, I'm writing a quick work-around patch for this, as this problem makes RM unavailable. , [~jianhe] - YARN-2716 is ready for review. I can make time for addressing any comments to get this in for trunk and branch-2. Given that, would it make sense to limit this fix to branch-2.7? , [~kasha], sure, make sense,  this can go into branch-2.7 only. And YARN-2716 can get in for trunk and branch-2. , After investigating more with Xuan, The problem is actually that the wait time in below method is set to zkSessionTimeout (10 seconds only), which doesn't actually make much sense. Here, the wait time is to wait for the zk-connection to be re-established 
{code}
while (zkClient == null) {
          ZKRMStateStore.this.wait(zkSessionTimeout);
          if (zkClient != null) {
            break;
          }
{code}, Upload a patch to set the wait time based on numRetries*retry-interval. 

I reproduced this issue locally in following way.
1. start ZK
2. start RM
3. kill ZK.
4. submit a job 
  - without the patch, RM will fail with the same IOException("Wait for ZKClient creation timed out") 
 - with the patch, after re-start ZK server, RM and job can continue run successfully. , This is short time solution and this is for branch-2.7 only. The main idea here is to increasing the waiting for RM to re-connect to ZK. 

I am ok with this patch. Will commit it later unless [~kasha] has additional comments., \\

This message was automatically generated., Fix looks reasonable to me., +1, LGTM. Check this in, Committed into branch-2.7. Thanks, Jian, I had a question. Do I need to explicitly set some yarn-site parameter to control runWithRetries in such a case? If so, which parameter needs to be set?]
