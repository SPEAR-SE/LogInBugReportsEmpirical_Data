LGTM, +1

I'm surprised that we missed these fields in the PB implementation.  We should be careful when we work on PB patches give that mostly we don't have tests for the PB changes., Thanks [~jianhe] for review and comments. This is not the first time I saw the similar mistake happens in PB implementation so I am sure this is not the last time. I suggest we add more unit tests for existing PB implementation and make sure any changes on PB implementation has unit test to make sure it works., Thoughts?, Adding unit tests for all records would be another big effort. Junping, you can open a new jira to discuss about this if needed.

, Thanks for fixing this.   +1 on adding more unit tests.   I think this area seems to be needing more tests as we also saw that this issue was not thought to be a problem (see YARN-1977 which does not validate  the PB part) , [~venkatnrangan], you are right. When similar bug happens, we often suspect the logic in client or server but ignore the wire logic. In most cases, we don't even have a simple unit test to verify these PBImpls which cause bug get hidden easily. Already filed YARN-2051 to address this, it would be great if you want to help there. Thanks!, Sorry for missing those merge-backs. A simple unit test like here wouldn't have let the mistake happen., bq. Sorry for missing those merge-backs. A simple unit test like here wouldn't have let the mistake happen.
No worry. We all make mistakes. :) I am proposing to add a simple unit test like this for any PBImpl changes in future. [~kasha] and all in watch list, Thoughts?, [~djp]  It would be good to have a unit test as I mentioned before.    The test case I uploaded was specific to one issue, but tests with directions of the wire transfers and something like that would be also.  May be that is something I will consider adding, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #561 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/561/])

[~venkatnrangan], you are right that end-to-end functional test (cover whole process of client, wire and server) like your demo test code is also very helpful. It would be great if you can file some JIRA and contribute it. I will help to review it. Thanks!
