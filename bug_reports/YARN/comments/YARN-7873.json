[sounds good to me. , I plan to revert from trunk, branch-3.0, branch-3.0.1, branch-2, and branch-2.9. Then we can remove the fix versions of 2.10.0 and 2.9.1 from YARN-6078 since they haven't been released., [~billie.rinaldi] if you going to revert it, please raise this JIRA to blocker.  

There are several point releases is in progress (i.e., 3.0.1 / 2.9.1), hopefully it will not be missed out., [~billie.rinaldi], I'm going to close this as invalid since it is a revert of original patch instead of new patch, and from the commit message we cannot find YARN-7873. In most cases we don't need a new Jira to do revert., Actually YARN-6078 was in a previous release 3.0.0. So, it makes sense to have a revert JIRA.

It's okay if we don't have the JIRA in the commit message.]
