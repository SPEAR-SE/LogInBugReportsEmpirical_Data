[IIUC i believe this is little tricky, though we ensure all the classes to have {{LoggerFactory.getLogger(<class>);}}, getLogger is overloaded to accept String too, so we can pass anything as the name of the logger due to which currently we are accepting any string. So to enforce "RM Loglevel setting shouldn't return a valid value for a non-existing class", we should go by the assumption that Logger name is always set as classname. 
Other disadvantage being, later might be we can plan to change the logger name to match a group of classes (or have it as the package name), so that we need not manually modify the log level of individual classes.
Thoughts ?, Thanks [~Naganarasimha] for the insights. Yes, the logLevel API support both class and package. We can make sure that string must be a classname or package name. If this is too tricky to implement, we can at least make sure that set or get log level for invalid string return an error message. ]
