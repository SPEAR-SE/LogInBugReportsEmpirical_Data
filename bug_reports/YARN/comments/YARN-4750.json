[this was intentional, as the thought was persisting the metrics periodically while the app is running will cause too much load on state-store., Agree [~jianhe]that it would be expensive to do update periodically.  However, it will be useful to indicate that the metrics are compromised.  One option can be to set the value to a special value (say a negative number) so as to to indicate a compromised value one time.  Just carrying on silently, can be misleading.]
