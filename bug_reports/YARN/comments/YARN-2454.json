[The compareTo() of Resource UNBOUNDED is copied from Resource NONE., Thanks for your contribution, [~beckham007]. The fix itself looks good to me. How about adding tests to TestResources like this?

{code}
  @Test(timeout=1000)
  public void testCompareToWithUnboundedResource() {
    assertTrue(Resources.unbounded().compareTo(
            createResource(Integer.MAX_VALUE, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) == 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.unbounded().compareTo(
        createResource(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0)) < 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.unbounded().compareTo(
        createResource(0, Integer.MAX_VALUE)) < 0);
  }

  @Test(timeout=1000)
  public void testCompareToWithNoneResource() {
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(createResource(0, 0)) == 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(
        createResource(1, 0)) < 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(
        createResource(0, 1)) < 0);
  }
{code}, sorry, testCompareToWithNoneResource is wrong. A fixed version is as follows:

{code}
  @Test(timeout=1000)
  public void testCompareToWithNoneResource() {
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(createResource(0, 0)) == 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(
        createResource(1, 0)) > 0);
    assertTrue(Resources.none().compareTo(
        createResource(0, 1)) > 0);
  }
{code}, Hi, [~ozawa]. It could be "assertTrue(Resources.unbounded().compareTo(
        createResource(Integer.MAX_VALUE, 0)) *>* 0)" ?, Oops, you're right. Could you update it?, One more thing, the "NONE" also need to update to UNBOUNDED.
{code}
    @Override
    public void setMemory(int memory) {
      throw new RuntimeException("NONE cannot be modified!");
    }
    @Override
    public void setVirtualCores(int cores) {
      throw new RuntimeException("NONE cannot be modified!");
    }
{code}, Also, the first testCompareToWithNoneResource is correct. Please ignore latter one., I have talked with [~yxls123123], he will update this patch. Thanks~, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Additional minor nits: how about moving the tests to org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resource.TestResorces instead of adding a new file?, [~tendo@uproadx.com], Thank you for your suggest. I genetate a new patch at root directory.
About moving these tests to org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.resource.Resources, I think it will be strange. Whereas moving the latter to the file that I created is a better way., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
