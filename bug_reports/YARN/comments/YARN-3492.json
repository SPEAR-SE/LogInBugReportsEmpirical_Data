[[~kasha], could you attach yarn-site.xml and mapred-site.xml for investigation?, [~kasha] Thanks for reporting this issue..

I took your mapred-site.xml and yarn-site.xml and started the pseudo-distributed cluster.. Containers are getting allocated and NM able connect to RM..

 *Please correct me If I am wrong..*

did you enable any firewall or host getting changed..?, bq. I took your mapred-site.xml and yarn-site.xml and started the pseudo-distributed cluster.. Containers are getting allocated and NM able connect to RM..
I suspect an env issue. Moving this out to 2.7.1. [~kasha]?, I am fine with relegating it to 2.7.1 or later, since it appears I am the only one who ran into this and that too only once. , I verified Hadoop-2.7 RC with same configurations attached in OS X. I am able to run the job successfully. I will be using the same cluster for further testing, if I face any issue will comment on the JIRA., [~kasha], can you try this on a different box or something to see if this is an env issue? Tx., Closing this based on previous comments. Please reopen this in case you run into it again.]
