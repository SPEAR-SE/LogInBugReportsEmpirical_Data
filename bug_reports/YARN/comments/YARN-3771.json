This message was automatically generated., +1 for the fixing security hole. One concern about the patch is backward compatibility since array string is changed to List. If any clients are using this default constant, it would cause compilation error to them. 

I would like to hear comments from the other folks for doing this change., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, bq. One concern about the patch is backward compatibility since array string is changed to List. If any clients are using this default constant, it would cause compilation error to them
Agreed, these are public constants. All applications will break with this change.

I'm closing this as Won't Fix for now. Please reopen if you disagree.]
