[This can be fixed by modifying the Jenkins code that runs prior to test-patch.sh.  I'll take care of it since we had the same problem on common a few months back., Yetus has the ability to recover from this automatically, but I've put the necessary magic into the yarn precommit header.  Now it just needs to run on the node with the problem.  Usually first run will break but subsequent runs will be fine.]
