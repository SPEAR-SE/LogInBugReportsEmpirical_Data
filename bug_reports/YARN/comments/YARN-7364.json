, [~sunilg], I'm not sure if this patch could break fair scheduler UI. Could you add more details of the fix?, Hi [~wangda] [~sunil.govind@gmail.com] 
Just checking, looks like this will go into trunk, is that correct? 

If so, I would like to go ahead with the branch2 merge once YARN-7338 is committed. I will backport this once this is closed. , [~vrushalic], sounds good! Thanks., With the current patch, FS UI wont come correct. I ll update a patch soon to handle both schedulers. And marking as target for 3.0 GA , Attaching patch to handle queue dash board page in cluster-overview for both CS and FS.
[~leftnoteasy] please help to review., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
