[I updated summary as per defect description., Consider scenario in following 
1. Yarn RM HA cluster is started with enabling ACL's. RM is in Active state.
2. Submit yarn application(app1), access this application from RM web ui.User is able to view the app1
3. Do transition ACTIVE --> STANDBY --> ACTIVE.
4. Submit another yarn application(app2). Try to access app2 link from RM web UI. It can not be viewed and throw NPE at RM log., The problem is due to RMWebApp is started and kept for thought jvm life time nevertheless of RM state change to active or standby. For AppBlock rendering , aclManager and queueAclManager instance are injected at the time of web service start for checkAccess users per application. {{aclManager}} does not find the application id in its and throw NPE. For the user, web page can not be accessible.  , The fix for the issue is 
1. Do not inject aclManager and queueAclManger instances rather make use of ResourceManger instance to get aclManager and queueAclManager which always get ActiveService instance, Attached patch without test. Did not get much idea how to write test for RMWeb in RMHA. I have verified fix manually testing. It is working fine. Kindly review.

Could you also check if binding to RMContext has similar problem ? It seems fine to me. Or we can also getRMContext from the rm object for future-proof.

This particular scenario I verified. This will not cuase any problem since RMContext created per JVM and activeservice instaces are updated.

bq. we can also getRMContext from the rm object for future-proof
Agree.
, The changes are very big for getting RMContext from rm object. Given for future-proof, I will change it., bq. The changes are very big for getting RMContext from rm object
How big that can be ? I'm fine to stay as is, if that's too big change., It is around 18 classes to be changed. However I have done changes. Will upload patch soon, Updated the patch with following changes.
# Removed the binding of RMContext ,aclManager and queueAclManager in RMWebApp and other test cases.
# Did clean up where both RM instance and RMContext instance were passed to {{MetricsOverviewTable}} {{ClusterMetricsInfo}} {{UserMetricsInfo}} classes which never used. I do not think it breaks compatability. What do you think?
# I ran test locally which all are passing. But many tests failed in previous QA result because of reason "address bind exception". I am analyzing it, will fix in another jira., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Pulled this into 2.6.1. Ran into a couple of minor import issues in a couple of classes, fixed them.

Pushed the patch after running compilation and running the tests TestRMWebServices,TestRMWebServicesApps,TestRMWebServicesAppsModification,TestRMWebServicesCapacitySched,TestRMWebServicesDelegationTokens,TestRMWebServicesFairScheduler,TestRMWebServicesNodeLabels and TestRMWebServicesNodes.]
