[I assume there's a configuration issue, because otherwise Docker support would be fundamentally broken.  We'll need more info to debug.  Let's take the discussion to the users list if you don't mind.  I'll leave this issue open for now in case there is an issue in the code., Thanks, I am also not pretty sure whether it is a configuration issue or code issue. Let's post this to user list.


Wei, I'm not able to recreate this issue. Please feel free to reopen if you are still seeing this issue.]
