, Thanks [~mradmila] for sharing the patch. Few general comments

1) Please follow patch naming convention as per this link. https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute#Naming_your_patch
This will help you to compile patch against respective branch. Also if its a general issue, you can give patch against trunk first.

2) Your patch has same file changes 3 times. Please help to upload a correct formatted patch. git commands could help here.

3) I am not very sure why a call back method needs to be exposed for preemption message. Doesnt it need to a part of container completed etc ? Could you please add some more details here, why this change is needed?]
