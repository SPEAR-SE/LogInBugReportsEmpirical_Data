[Hi Vinod,

bq. When the Application is still not running, the Tracking UI should be title "UNASSIGNED", for some reason it is titled "ApplicationMaster" but (correctly) links to "#".

This point has been taken care in MAPREDUCE-3140, below 2 issues
1) Remove the "Note" column from the application list. When a failure happens, this "Note" spoils the table layout.
and 
2) The per-application page has all the RM related information like version, start-time etc. Must be some accidental change by one of the patches.

are no longer present.
, Fixing the last issues
