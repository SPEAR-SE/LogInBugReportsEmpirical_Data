[[~jlowe], thanks for reporting this. The heartbeat interval was kept intentionally low as the purpose of the test was to trigger token renewals. We can either reduce the AM/NM heartbeat interval or increase the AM expiry interval. 
I prefer the former as the latter will result in longer time for triggering token renewal. Thoughts?, I'm not a fan of either approach since it either creates sporadic failures because the timeouts are too aggressive or the test takes far too long to run.  If the whole point of all this waiting is to get a token renewed, I'd rather do one or more of the following:
# Add a way for tests to force a token renewal rather than needing to wait some specific amount of wall clock time
# Programmatically invoke/control the heartbeating for both the NM and the AM in the test so we aren't needlessly waiting in the test for a heartbeat timer to expire
# Move the relevant pieces over to a controlled clock where we can programmatically speed up time if necessary to trigger certain time-based events

A typical tell-tale sign for a unit test with race conditions is when it calls Thread.sleep.  The test is going to sometimes fail because something didn't run fast enough relative to the sleep or the test runs needlessly longer than it should.  Usually both.
