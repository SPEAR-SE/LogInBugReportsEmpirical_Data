This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~vvasudev]! The patch looks good to me, we should have done this long time back - to use the full-IDs in the paths.

The test passes for me now, checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Varun!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5497 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5497/])
