[Attaching the patch., Rebasing the patch., Similar to HDFS-4610, I still saw a failure in {{TestNodeHealthService}} after applying this patch.  Ivan, did this patch fix that test for you?
, Thanks Chris for the review!

bq. I still saw a failure in TestNodeHealthService after applying this patch. Ivan, did this patch fix that test for you?
Nope, the scope of the patch is to move to new common utils, and the test fails for a different reason. I validated that TestNodeHealthService#testNodeHealthScriptShouldRun succeeds with the patch (test revokes the execute permission on the script and validates that the script cannot run)., +1 for the patch.  Thank you, Ivan!, I should have mentioned that my +1 is dependent on commit of HADOOP-9413 first, followed by +1 from Jenkins here on YARN-506.  Thanks again!, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
