[Hi [~tangshangwen] do you mind if I assign this to myself? I have just run into the same issue and would like to provide a fix for this., [~wilfreds]ok, I was thrown of track a bit with all the changes that were made to the locking in the scheduler in YARN-3139.

After analysis it shows that the issue is not resolved yet and we have two situations that can cause a the above mentioned problem:
# if a call for a {{removeApplicationAttempt}} and a {{moveApplication}} for the same attempt are processed in that order in short succession the application attempt will still contain a queue reference but is already removed from the list of applications for the queue
# if two calls to {{removeApplicationAttempt}} come in in short succession the application will still contain a queue reference but is already removed from the list of applications for the queue

In both cases the 2nd call must come in before the {{removeApplication}} call is made., Patch to prevent double removal and a move after removal
Also changes the an IllegalStateException for a checked case to a YarnException so it does not take the RM down for that case, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, TestRMRestart#testFinishedAppRemovalAfterRMRestart failure is logged as YARN-5362 and closed as resolved. It looks like the change has not fixed it completely. Maybe a follow up needs to be logged for that.
TestTokenClientRMService#testCancelWithMultipleAppSubmissions failure is tracked in YARN-5816 and is not caused by this change.

Both tests pass in my local testing., Opened YARN-5895 to track the new failure in TestRMRestart#testFinishedAppRemovalAfterRMRestart, Thanks for the patch.  It looks to me like it might be better to throw a {{YarnException}} in {{moveApplication()}} rather than just returning the current queue's name.  The exception gets swallowed by the transition, so it shouldn't hurt anything, and it feels like the more natural path, rather than pretending that everything's OK.  Also your tests don't explicitly test anything.  I get that you're just seeing if the operation blows up, but it would be nice to do some additional confirmation, like that the app is still in the original queue., Updated the patch with the review comments:
- added state checks in the tests
- change the return to a throw if the app was stopped before the move, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for the update, [~wilfreds].  Looks like the move test isn't testing the app's queue after the move yet., That test finishes with an exception being thrown (and caught as declared in the test expected) and because of that no update of the application object happens. Testing the application after the exception is thrown does not make sense to me based on that change. I left out testing it. If the application is changed there will be no exception and the test fails., Yep, good point.  +1 on the latest patch.  I'll commit shortly., Thanks for the patch, [~wilfreds]!  Committed to trunk and branch-2., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #10961 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/10961/])
