[JIRA is for reporting bugs or tracking features rather than general user support.  The [mailing lists|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html] would be more appropriate for this.

There are two possible reasons why this error is occurring.  Either the task cannot find libhadoop.so or libhadoop.so was compiled without Snappy support.  For the former, see if the message "Unable to load native-hadoop library for your platform" appears in the task logs.  If it does then the task is not loading libhadoop.so and Snappy cannot work.  Check the LD_LIBRARY_PATH environment variable setting to make sure the task can locate libhadoop.so.  If it is loading libhadoop.so properly then the error means the native library was compiled without Snappy support and needs to be rebuilt with -Drequire.snappy=true
, Closing this since this is a user issue with the build and/or deployment of Hadoop and not a bug in Hadoop itself.
