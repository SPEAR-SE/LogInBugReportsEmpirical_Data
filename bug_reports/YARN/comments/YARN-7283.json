[Hi [~Sorey], have you configured {{yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb}}/{{yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores}} on NM or {{yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb}}/{{yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-vcores}} on RM? {{yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb}} is required to be at least {{yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb}} (same with vcores)., Hi [~jhung] i tried many way to reslove , such as set yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb/yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-vcores to 1 or 0 . if I set both to 0 then nodemanager started but resourcemanager can't start with the same log., Hi Nguyen! JIRA is for reporting bugs. Please use the user mailing list for these questions.

Please set {{yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb}}, {{yarn.nodemanager.resource.cpu-vcores}} in your yarn-site.xml, Thanks [~raviprak] . I really resolved it . And sorry about made issue at here. Can i make questions with jira? If i can, Where ? This is first time for me.
