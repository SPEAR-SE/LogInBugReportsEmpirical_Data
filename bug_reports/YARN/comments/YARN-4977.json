[I wouldn't be surprised if there were tens of thousands of warnings.  I agree that it's something we should clean up.  Maybe we can treat this JIRA as an umbrella JIRA and file subtasks to address one module at a time.  Otherwise it's going to be more than any one person can fix or review., Hi [~templedf], sure, let's do that. I agree that there might be tons of them, so we can fix them gradually. Please feel free to open JIRAs to track separate efforts on this. Thanks! , Uploaded a patch at subtask YARN-5429 that addresses the warnings in yarn-api of the type of "no @return" and some others]
