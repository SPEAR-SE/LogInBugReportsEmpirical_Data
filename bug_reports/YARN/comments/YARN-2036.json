[This should clean up the table on ClusterSetup.apt.vm., Thanks Ray. Comments:
# This is not entirely correct. One can choose to set yarn.resourcemanager.address in addition to setting yarn.resourcemanager.hostname to override the actual host:port used.
{noformat}

{noformat}

+| <<<yarn.resourcemanager.hostname>>> | | |
