[problems with old code: if you are using some system resources such as file handles in native library implementation of process tree then java can create kinda lot of objects of processTree type which are not garbage collected and temporary leaks system resources.

If you start chaining references to original object, then you will have allocated system resources just once but you will create long chain on objects which could not be GC'd by java until all of them are unreferenced at end of container life.

I tried both and didn't liked it, after inspection of code calling psTree it was discovered that simply updating object will be enough because code do not keeps old copy around while creating a new one., Also remove getProcResourceValues from Resource Calculator API because it is not used anywhere and pluggable pstree has same functionality, Migrated Task from ResourceCalculator to PsTree API., +1 patch looks good

I successfully applied the patch to current trunk, compiled, and ran tests.  A potential improvement is to add @Override annotations to the methods of TestResourceCalculatorProcessTree.EmptyProcessTree.  This isn't directly related to your current change though, so I leave it up to you whether or not you want to update the patch., Just commit it before YARN-234 patch goes in. YARN-234 contains ResouceCalculator API change because of not understanding usage of getProcResourceValues. As this patch removes it, no changes are needed anymore., will leave it as it is. version 6 passed QA bot checks., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., +1 for the code and approach. The patch changes some public members. Not sure about those changes since they may not meet back-compat requirements., its private api

@InterfaceAudience.Private
@InterfaceStability.Unstable, i need to get this committed. Its one month already., # The changes to eliminate usage of ResourceCalculatorPlugin is incorrect. Process tree is an impl detail of ResourceCalculatorPlugin. Many systems don't have process tree or equivalent at all.
# You only need to change the interface of ResourceCalculatorProcessTree and impl of ProcfsBasedProcessTree.
, process tree is standalone component for some time., currently every system (windows and linux) which have resource calculator has process tree.

if hypothetical system has just resource calculator but not resource process tree then it will miss just some stats currently sent to RM but not used anywhere. Most important function - watching container resources will be still missing without process tree., Upon second look, though the current ResourceCalculatorProcessTree interface is not ideal (checkPidPgrpidMatches threw me off, which should simply be checkOwnership), it's general enough I think.

+1 for the patch. Will commit shortly.

, Committed to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Radim for the patch and Chris and Bikas for the review., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3144 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3144/])

, This patch breaks compilation of 'Apache Hadoop Gridmix' on branch-2.
There is an import of org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util.ResourceCalculatorPlugin.ProcResourceValues which were removed by this patch.
