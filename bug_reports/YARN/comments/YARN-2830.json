This message is automatically generated., Hi [~jeagles], thanks for your reporting and contribution. I checked the source code of Tez Local Mode:

{code}
          ContainerId cId = ContainerId.newInstance(applicationAttemptId, 1);
{code}

I think it's more straight forward to fix as following at Tez than adding int-type newInstance method:

{code}
          ContainerId cId = ContainerId.newInstance(applicationAttemptId, 1L);
{code}

What do you think? cc: [~bikassaha], [~ozawa], I understand your fix, and that is the correct fix in Tez. But right now I am looking at clusters that are running Tez 0.5.1 running on Hadoop 2.5.1. Those clusters can't be upgraded to Hadoop 2.6.0 without breaking Tez. This is purely to maintain backwards compatibility in Hadoop. , [~jeagles] Make sense. Do you mind marking new method as Deprecated? It's useful for users not to use this method wrongly., v2 patch is validated to work against Tez 0.5.1 existing release compiled against Hadoop 2.5.1 running against Hadoop 2.6.0, [~ozawa], I've validated this patch and added the deprecated flag. Filed TEZ-1755 to stop using this deprecated issue., [~ozawa], Cross-posting [~hitesh]'s comment from TEZ-1755.

This message is automatically generated., +1 for retaining the old newInstance method.
One concern about the patch though - ContainerId will end up with two very similar methods.
newContainerId(AppAttemptId, int) | Deprecated
newContainerId(AppAttemptId, long)
It's very easy to get these incorrect within YARN itself - which can introduce some tough to debug issues.

Instead, I think it'll be a lot safer to rename the new method - and retaining the old one with the old one for compatibility., [~sseth], [~ozawa], new patch moves newInstance -> newContainerId and re-adds the old newInstance. I'm open to other names for the new API. Please review when you get a chance., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

[~jeagles], I'll review a patch after fixing the build failure., bq. When can we expect to mark ContainerId.newInstance as public stable to avoid this type of incompatibility in the future?
