[This patch adds in deletion of logs that are too old.  If you are upgrading an older cluster you will need to run a chmod on all of the existing logs or the user running History Server will probably not have write permissions to the files., Patch looks good overall, some cleanup comments:

* Probably need a release note stating the necessary chmod operations on user directories under the top-level aggregated log directory
* Speaking of which, is it worth checking the permissions of the user directory before we try to delete all the application logs underneath it?  I'm thinking of all the exceptions that will be logged periodically if one user's log directory doesn't have the proper permissions to allow deletion but there are hundreds of application logs underneath it.
* With all the nested try/catch blocks, it might be easier to read if one or more of the {{for}} loops were factored out into private methods
* Spelling nits (many are end-user visible and should be cleaned up):
** retain is misspelled in yarn.log-aggregation.retian-seconds
** being is misspelled as beign
** "desabled because retiontion" should be "disabled because retention"
** aggregated misspelled as aggregatied

This message is automatically generated., Getting close, a few more points:
* We're checking the permission of each app log directory, but the permission of the user log directory above them could prevent us from deleting the app directory.
* Checking for group write doesn't imply we'd still be able to delete.  I'm thinking in particular of the setup issues discussed in MAPREDUCE-4557.

Rather than trying to avoid the errant deletes and potentially screwing up those checks, we could just proceed with the delete attempt and not log a giant exception if the error is a permission problem.  We could still end up logging a line per application in a misconfigured user log directory, but that's better than logging dozens of lines for a full exception trace that isn't helpful for permission issues anyway., Yes I agree, it was ugly when I put that check in, and after thinking about it I saw the check as well.  I will update it.  The issue with outputting only a small message is with HADOOP-8661, so I will have to do something a bit ugly to make the message small, at least until HADOOP-8661 goes in.  If this one goes in first I will probably just undo the uglyness in the that patch., OK I updated the tests, and I updated the code to just log the smaller error., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., +1 (non-binding), lgtm.  Thanks Bobby!, Mostly looks good. couple minor things:

   * we should add new configs to the release notes.
   * YarnConfiguration - the comment is wrong (+  /** Whether to enable log aggregation */) - should be to enable log aggregation deletion service.  
   * I'm on the wall about the 30 minute check.  In one way its nice so users don't shoot themselves but at the same time it makes it harder to test and is less flexible.  I think in the minimum we should document that we have the 30 minute config, otherwise perhaps just remove the check and add a comment that you shouldn't set it to low. 

, Will do.  I'll remove the 30 min check, I don't think we really need it, but I'll put in a comment with it warning people., Hopefully all issues are now addressed, +1 Thanks Bobby!, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
