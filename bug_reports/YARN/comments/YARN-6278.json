[It looks like the Node.js version is very old in the machine where this build has happened.

{code}
| | |npm WARN npm npm does not support Node.js v0.10.25
npm WARN npm You should probably upgrade to a newer version of node as we
npm WARN npm can't make any promises that npm will work with this version.
{code}

Investigating with same version. cc/[~Sreenath] [~leftnoteasy], I used Node.js v0.10.25 in an ubuntu VM and I am getting same error.
So this is due to an old version of node in that machine. I am not very sure why this is tripped now, it might be due to some recent dependency change in ember's core module.

A possible fix is to enforce minimum version for node in all machines where UI has to be compiled. Thoughts?  [~Sreenath] and [~leftnoteasy], Attaching patch after forcing correct node and npm version in compile machine., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
