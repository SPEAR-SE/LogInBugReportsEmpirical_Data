This message is automatically generated., I analyze Hadoop QA reports for "Release audit warning" and found failure is from TestNameNodeOptionParsing.java where my patch doesnot contain this class :-(, Rohith, tx for the patch. The code changes look fine, but some suggestions 
 - Add a simple log when the crash happens.

Test
 - It seems unnatural to override rebootNodeStatusUpdater. Instead override registerWithRM to pass the first time and fail the second time.
 - assertionFailedInThread is used to catch false results in threads. Use a different variable specific to the test indicating that shutdown is successfully called. 
 - Instead of the hardcoded sleep, wait for the above new flag to become true or till a timeout occurs., Good catch! thanks for working on this., Thank you vinod for your reviewing patch.

I have updated the patch addressing all your comments. Please review new patch.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks better. It misses a test-timeout though, fixing it myself., Same patch as before but with a test time-out. Will check it in once Jenkins says okay.., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
