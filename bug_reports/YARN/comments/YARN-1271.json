This message is automatically generated., +1, looks good to me. This is the exact same fix as what we used in MAPREDUCE-2374.

Thanks, Sandy., Thanks for taking a look ATM.  I just committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.1-beta., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4534 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4534/])

, [~sandyr] Looks like you need to fix {{getRunCommand(String command, String groupId)}} too? Or, we should have removed it since it doesn't look like it's getting used?, Is this the only place left or UnixShellScriptBuilder.command should be changed too?

[~sandyr]/[~atm], tx for working on the patch, but you should let the patch alone for a few hours so that others can get a chance to look. Though this one had some history, I am always more nervous about one line changes., [~acmurthy], didn't notice the other version of getRunCommand because for some reason it's not present in trunk (but is in branch-2 and 2.1-beta).  I'll post an addendum for those branches that removes the unused method.

[~vinodkv], sorry for the quick turnaround, will wait longer next time.  UnixShellScriptBuilder shouldn't have the same change because it executes an arbitrary command instead of a bash file., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #352 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/352/])

, Posted branch-2 addendum, Looks good, quickly check which patch removed this in trunk., The branch-2 patch for YARN-443 somehow misssed this. +1, checking in your change., Done., Thanks Vinod!, These errors are still coming up for me after the patch.  I took another look and apparently I had looked at UnixShellScriptBuilder, but missed UnixLocalWrapperScriptBuilder, which also uses the "-c".  Filed YARN-1295 for this.  Sorry for all the noise., I am seeing the same error using the latest HortonWorks distribution of hadoop:

I wonder if I should open another bug report or just track this one.  Any suggestions?, Can someone point me to link that can explain how the launch_container.sh is suppose to get to a local file system during a run?  I can't find any documentation about how this and other scripts are shipped out across the allocation and I feel this would be helpful towards a better understanding of related failures., Vaughn E. Clinton, if possible, can you rebuild with the patch at YARN-1295 and try? If you are running into more issues even after that patch, you can reopen one of the two tickets., Closing old tickets that are already shipped in a release.]
