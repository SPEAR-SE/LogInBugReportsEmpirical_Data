[[~yeshavora], thank you for reporting this. Please review YARN-7064, the docs in question are being updated there together with adding additional configuration, so you might need to merge with this jira. I like the additional information, that you provided in the description. Please note that I think swappiness is not precisely the amount of memory that can be swapped out just the aggressiveness of the swapping algorithm.]
