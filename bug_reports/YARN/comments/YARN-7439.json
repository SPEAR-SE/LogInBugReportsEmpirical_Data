# The main documentation page for the ReservationSystem (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ReservationSystem.html) should call out how to switch on the reservaiton system in yarn-site.xml 
# The submission-reservation.json example in (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ResourceManagerRest.html#Cluster_Reservation_API_Submit) is missing a coma after reservation id.
# When the reservation system is disabled and we attempt to invoke new-reservation we get:

{code}
{
  "RemoteException": {
    "exception": "YarnRuntimeException",
    "message": "Unable to create new reservation from RM web service",
    "javaClassName": "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.exceptions.YarnRuntimeException"
  }
}
{code}

which is not the most telling message.  By constrast the submission throws back a more appropriate:

{code}
{
  "RemoteException": {
    "exception": "BadRequestException",
    "message": "java.lang.Exception: Reservation is not enabled. Please enable & try again",
    "javaClassName": "org.apache.hadoop.yarn.webapp.BadRequestException"
  }
}
{code}]
