[I would like to demote the RMContainerImpl state transition log to DEBUG and use an AsyncAppender for the RMAuditLogger (at least make this configurable if not default).
[~vinodkv], as these logs are pretty core, wanted to check what your thoughts are on this?, Hi [~sandyr], I had raised YARN-2287 which is also about printing of too many RM Audit logs in critical flow. For this, in the patch, I had added support for printing audit logs at different log levels and changed container logs in RM and NM to DEBUG. I didnt remove the audit logs as I wasnt sure if these audit logs are really required or not.  ]
