I have two minor comments:
1. Shell#checkWindowsCommandLineLength: Can you please add a comment saying that caller is responsible to account for spaces between individual commands. It might also be useful to include info in the message on what the command actual length was and first 100 chars or so that it's even easier to pinpoint the problem.
2. ContainerLaunch: Would you mind also including unittest that validates that errorCheck() works as expected on Windows/Linux. Just do it for one random command (e.q. mkdirs with invalid chars in the name), no need to do it for all.

Otherwise, the patch looks good to me. , With review feedback, Resubmit for .3.patch QA run, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I have one more comment, can you please also include a unit test that validates errorCheck() behavior on Unix? You can either try to come up with a shell cmd line that will fail on both Unix and Windows, or add a separate unittest for Unix., Addressing my latest comment to add a test case for the non-zero exit code.
