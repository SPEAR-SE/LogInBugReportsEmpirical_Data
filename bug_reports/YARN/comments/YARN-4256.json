This message was automatically generated., Thanks Jun Gong. , [~zxu], could you please help review it?, Thanks for reporting this issue [~Prabhu Joseph]! Thanks for the patch [~hex108]! The patch looks most good. Can we change '+' to '*'
(\\.\\d+)? => (\\.\\d*)? So we can relax the condition to support 1024. mb.
, Thanks [~zxu] for the review and comments.

Attach a new patch to address it and add a new test for the case '1024. mb'., \\
