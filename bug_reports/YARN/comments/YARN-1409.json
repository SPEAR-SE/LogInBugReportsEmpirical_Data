This message is automatically generated., Is it sufficient to only check for scheduler shutdown before scheduling?  I'm thinking of the multithreaded case where we check if the scheduler is shutdown, and it isn't, but then another thread shuts it down just before we schedule.  Should we instead expect to catch RejectedExecutionException when we try to schedule and act appropriately?  Or alternatively if we don't care about rejected executions, install an appropriate RejectedExecutionHandler that doesn't throw when the thread pool executor is created., Thank you for the review, Jason. I overlooked the case you pointed out. I'll update a patch to handle RejectedExecutionException and retry to handle the events., Sorry for delay.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for updating the patch.  Comments:

- It should be straightforward to add a test.  We can either shut down the log handler service then try to inject an APPLICATION_FINISHED event or mock an executor.
- Minor nit: would be nice to save the new LogDeleterRunnable in a local and reference in the try/catch rather than replicate the code., Thank you for the review, [~jlowe]. I apologize for the delay.
1. Added a test case to reproduce this issue

This message is automatically generated., +1 lgtm, committing this.  A minor nit is that the org.junit.Assert import that was added to the test is unnecessary.  Will clean this up during the commit., Thanks, Tsuyoshi!
