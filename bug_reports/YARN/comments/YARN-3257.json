[Patch demonstrating the behavior change, The implementation looks correct to me functionally, but I wonder if this should be something deferred to the policy?  I realize on a practical level this might mean some duplicate code, but I wonder if, from a policy/contract perspective, it properly should be up to the policy to support or not support this "exception to the rule" logic?  This might mean expanding the signature on the policy side to include the number of currently running apps as I don't know that the policy is otherwise aware of that.  I don't feel strongly that this needs to be the approach, I just wanted to throw it out there for consideration.]
