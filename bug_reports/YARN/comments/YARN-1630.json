[Added a patch that mitigates the issue I ran into., Can the config be added as a timeout instead of a number of polls?

Also, a couple nits:
Timeout should default to -1, meaning forever
No need for message var.  just LOG.info directly.
An (Yarn)exception should be thrown to indicate that the operation didn't complete in time.  Otherwise clients might think it had completed succesfuly., Updated with suggested feedback., Thanks Aditya.  To make the naming less ambiguous, we should call the property client.application-client-protocol.poll-timeout-ms.

After that, LGTM., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. The RM log indicated that the app had indeed transitioned from RUNNING to KILLED
Hi Aditya,  if the above is true, the client should break out of the waiting loop as "response.getIsKillCompleted()" should return true. I'm wondering if there are other hidden bugs. Do you have the RM log ?
, There definitely appears to be another bug, but unfortunately we weren't able to find anything fishy in the RM log and weren't able to reproduce it.  When it comes up again and we can gather more information, we'll post additional details., Added updated diff with requested changes., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
