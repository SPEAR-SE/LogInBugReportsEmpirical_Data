[I understand this is an inconvenience, but this is by design. One of those bug-or-feature cases. See https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-1029?focusedCommentId=13861990&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13861990, Does it make sense to print a help message instead of throwing NPE ?, Indeed, that makes more sense., I faced the problem and looked at the cause of the NullPointerException. It happens as follows:

1. {{String clusterId = YarnConfiguration.getClusterId(conf);}} in {{EmbeddedElectorService#serviceInit}} throws the HadoopIllegalArgumentException with messages.
2. {{AbstractService#serviceInit}} handles the Exception and calls {{ServiceOperations.stopQuietly}} in the exception handler.
3. {{EmbeddedElectorService#serviceStop()}} is called, but the field {{elector}} is not initialized.

The attached patch to fix it. The error message is changed with the patch:
