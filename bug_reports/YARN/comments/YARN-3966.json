[+1. Some messages are not necessary to be in INFO level which mess up RM logs. I think we have two options here:
1. Move scheduler log message out of RM logs.
2. Downgrade some scheduler log level from INFO to DEBUG., How about that we combine two options together ? I think that potentially for all the plugin components in RM, we need to separate their logs from RM logs.  , I went through the code path and cleaned up some logs as needed. 

Uploaded a patch to do that., Instead of removing the logs, change the log level from info to debug ?, The logs I removed are redundant logs with others. Apart from that,  some logs are also moved from info to debug., Patch LGTM, +1., \\
