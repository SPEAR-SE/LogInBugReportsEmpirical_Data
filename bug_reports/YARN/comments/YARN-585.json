[After YARN-514, storing application becomes a state of an RMApp's life cycle. RMStateStore needs the applicationId from ApplicationSubmissionContext, it cannot be null. Therefore, we need to make sure applicationId is set in ApplicationSubmissionContext when the RMApp's transitions are tested.

A specific problem with TestFairScheduler#testNotAllowSubmitApplication is that due to one more state before RMApp enters SUBMITTED, APP_REJECTED is already sent to the attempt. It results in an undefined transition. So before generating the APP_REJECTED event, main thread should be hung on for 100ms and yield the process to asyncDispatcher to move MRApp to SUBMITTED, where the attempt is instantiated and the START event is sent. Therefore, the attempt gets START, moves from NEW to SUBMITTED, where the transition from SUBMITTED to FAILED on APP_REJECTED is defined., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for taking care of this, [~zjshen]. The fix looks mostly good. 

Minor comment: Sleep might be better in the following form.
{code}
for (int i = 0; i < 20 && state != SUBMITTED; i++) {
  Thread.sleep(100)
}
assertTrue("Didn't move to SUBMITTED to", state == SUBMITTED)

, It looks like the test is completely bypassing the state machine of the RMApp and so will break every time the state machine is changed in a way the test does not handle. It directly sends scheduler.addApplication() without waiting for the app to reach the state in which this can happen. I wonder if the addapplication is being called twice in here? The test doesnt even call resourcemanager.start() even though its using the resource manager.
{code}
    application.handle(new RMAppEvent(applicationId, RMAppEventType.START));

    ApplicationAttemptId attId = recordFactory.newRecordInstance(ApplicationAttemptId.class);
    attId.setAttemptId(this.ATTEMPT_ID++);
    attId.setApplicationId(applicationId);
    scheduler.addApplication(attId, queue, user);
{code}, Agree with Bikas, +1 on fixing the test further - filed YARN-587 for that.

Thanks [~zjshen] for quickly taking care of this., I stepped through the test, and found addapplication wouldn't execute twice. SchedulerEventDispatcher received AppAddedSchedulerEvent, but before SchedulerEventDispatcher handled it, RMApp had already reached FAILED due to the direct call of addapplication., Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #188 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/188/])
