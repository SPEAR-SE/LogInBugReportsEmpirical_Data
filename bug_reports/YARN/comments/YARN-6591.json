[Interesting idea.  Any thoughts on the compatibility implications?
, Yeah, it would need be an additional field.
- We may append the NodeId in the String so that old code ContainerId#fromString can still parse the containerId string with NodeId, and new code can still parse the ContainerId String without the NodeId.
- We may  also add equivalent new APIs in NMClient to use the NodeId so that callers using old API still works. 

- For existing code which starts using the NodeId - the logic would be fallback to the old way if the NodeId doesn't exist.
-- For example, one other use case may be the LogCLI, currently it queries RM or ATS to get the NodeId for the container. With this change, this part can be avoided and the logic would be if NodeId doesn't exist, use the old way to get the NodeId.]
