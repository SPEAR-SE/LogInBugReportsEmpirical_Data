, [~kasha@cloudera.com] kindly review the attached patch... ,This is failing all the patches, marking it as a blocker...please feel free to change defect severity, if wn't agree with me.., The earlier commit was causing issues, and I have reverted it recently. I don't think this is an urgent concern.

The only reason we would want to fix this is to generally reduce the tech debt in the FairScheduler.

Am I missing something? , I agree with Karthik's comment - this is not urgent concern. In fact, findbugs-exclude.xml is not outdated since FairScheduler does some optimization which findbugs warns for getting better concurrency. On this JIRA, we should check the order of lock very carefully without degrading performance. As a result, it would be better we can remove  IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC exclusion from findbugs-exclude file., didn't get chance to work on this,so un assigning]
