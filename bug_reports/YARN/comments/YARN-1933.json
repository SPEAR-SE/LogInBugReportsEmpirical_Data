[- TestAMRestart:
Removed the following check, because after we send the container complete event,  the containers could  be just removed immediately from the liveContainers inside the schedulerAttempt, which causes NPE
{code}
     nm1.nodeHeartbeat(am1.getApplicationAttemptId(), 3, ContainerState.COMPLETE);
-    rm1.waitForState(nm1, containerId3, RMContainerState.COMPLETED);
{code}
Also  changed some test logic to wait until the expected number of containers reached.

- TestNodeHealthService:
Give write and read permission of the script file and also Put the close() in finally block.

- Minor side fix in ZKRMStateStore.java: moved the error message to debug level  as I found that the createRootDir method will throw NodeAlreadyExistsException if the root already exits. And it's always the case that the root exits after RM restarts., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
