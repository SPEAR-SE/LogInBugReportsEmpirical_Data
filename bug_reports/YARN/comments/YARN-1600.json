[A number of ways to address this, and I'm sure there are others:

* have the RM avoid setting spnego confs on the WebApps setup if the confs have no values set
* have WebApps avoid setting up username and keytab confs for HttpServer if those confs have no values set (similar to early patches on YARN-1463)
* if we're worried we need to make sure users are aware that they configured security but not spnego and want to make that break by default as it does today then we need a separate config to indicate the user really wants to run with security but not spnego on the RM web pages
, I think at least in the short term that the earlier approach of YARN-1463 could work. We'll need to revisit the issue of supporting SPNEGO and third-party HTTP authentication in the longer term., My understanding of the Hadoop web security requirement is as follows.
- SPNEGO should be used, if a REST API needs to be secured.
- User-facing web pages should be accessible through a custom auth filter without requiring SPNEGO. 

I assume ResourceManager currently does not need to secure its REST APIs. Unless this assumption is wrong, SPNEGO should not be required in RM. The early patch on YARN-1463 might be the easiest way to stay this way. I am for fixing it ASAP this way.

We will however extend the REST API in the future and that will likely require auth.  So we will eventually face the "SPNEGO required in RM if security is on" situation. Namenode is already like this. It is okay or even preferable  to make the server to fail to start if SPNEGO is not setup in this case, but still web UI accesses should not require SPNEGO-based auth.
, This patch ports the solution in the earlier patches of YARN-1463., +1, lgtm.  Will commit this shortly., On second thought, holding off the commit until the recent branch-2.3 re-swizzle is sorted out., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
