[{{org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.webapp.AppBlock.generateApplicationTable}} constructs what it believes should be the AM container ID when creating a new {{GetContainerReportRequest}}.
{code}
        // AM container is always the first container of the attempt
        final GetContainerReportRequest request =
            GetContainerReportRequest.newInstance(ContainerId.newContainerId(
              appAttemptReport.getApplicationAttemptId(), 1));
{code}
- After the RM is restarted, container IDs contain an {{e##}} string, which the above code doesn't take into consideration
- The AM container is not always _000001 due to the way reservations work. We have seen "non-first" AM containers in practice.

As a result of the above code, the container ID in the {{GetContainerReportRequest}} may not match the actual AM container ID before RM restart, and will not match those for jobs run after the RM is restarted.

So, When {{ApplicationHistoryManagerImpl}} compares the ID of the passed container with it's cache from the history store, it can't find a match and throws the NPE.

In {{AppBlock#generateApplicationTable}}, instead of constructing the AM's container ID, I suggest using appAttemptReport#getAMContainerId instead:
{code}
        final GetContainerReportRequest request =
            GetContainerReportRequest.newInstance(
                    appAttemptReport.getAMContainerId());
{code}, Unit testing is a little challenging, so I have not added those. However, I have tested successfully on a one-node cluster installation and on a 10-node secured cluster.
