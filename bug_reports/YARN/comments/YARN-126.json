[Hello,
please find attached a patch for this.
I removed -jt and replaced it by a -rm.
Also, I saw that the Gnu Readline is used for YARN distributed shell so I did the same and removed Configured and ToolRunner to use the Readline.
Therefore, the usage looks like this:

usage: yarn rmadmin
yarn rmadmin is the command to execute ResourceManager administrative
commands.
 -conf <configuration file>             specify an application
                                        configuration file.
 -getGroups <usernames>                 Get the groups which given user of
                                        the comma separated list of users
                                        belongs to.
 -help                                  Print usage.
 -refreshAdminAcls                      Refresh acls for administration of
                                        ResourceManager.
 -refreshNodes                          Refresh the hosts information at
                                        the ResourceManager.
 -refreshQueues                         Reload the queues' acls, states
                                        and scheduler specific
                                        properties.ResourceManager will
                                        reload the mapred-queues
                                        configuration file.
 -refreshServiceAcl                     Reload the service-level
                                        authorization policy
                                        fileResoureceManager will reload
                                        the authorization policy file.
 -refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration   Refresh superuser proxy groups
                                        mappings.
 -refreshUserToGroupsMappings           Refresh user-to-groups mappings.
 -rm <local|resourcemanager:port>       specify a resource manager.

Thanks.
, Thanks for working on this.  

A few comments. Unfortunately we aren't consistent across hadoop how we print usages.  

- In the usage print out, I'd prefer to separate out the generic options like -D, -conf, and -rm from the actual commands so that its more obvious to users what the commands are. 
- Capitalize usage in yarn rmadmin (Usage:)
- the usage should say something like: yarn rmadmin [generic options] COMMAND


We should also fix the GenericOptionsParser to not reference the jobtracker anymore, but I can file a separate jira for that., bq. We should also fix the GenericOptionsParser to not reference the jobtracker anymore, but I can file a separate jira for that.
Shouldn't this be the correct fix instead of throwing out GenericOptionsParser altogether?, I removed the GenericOptionsParser because I saw that the yarn distributed shell ApplicationMaster.java relies on org.apache.commons.cli.GnuParser instead.
So I though that since an options parser is not something specific to Hadoop, it might be a good thing to remove the GenericOptionParser dependency where it is possible to favor the commons.cli library instead.
Isn't it the case?

, {quote}Shouldn't this be the correct fix instead of throwing out GenericOptionsParser altogether?{quote}

I'm a bit torn on that. yes it does have a couple of the options used but it also has others that do not apply to the rmadmin command. It also has the generic usage statement of: "bin/hadoop command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]" which doesn't apply at all.  I guess another option is to change the GenericOptionsParser to be able to specify which options can be used and have it print the correct usage statements and so forth.  

Ideally I think we should redo all of the hadoop/hdfs/yarn/mapred commands to have consistent usage and interfaces but that is a much bigger change. , This version fixes the way usage is printed out.
Now we have:

RMAdmin
Usage: yarn rmadmin [generic options] COMMAND

 -getGroups <usernames>                 Get the groups which given user of
                                        the comma separated list of users
                                        belongs to.
 -help                                  Print usage.
 -refreshAdminAcls                      Refresh acls for administration of
                                        ResourceManager.
 -refreshNodes                          Refresh the hosts information at
                                        the ResourceManager.
 -refreshQueues                         Reload the queues' acls, states
                                        and scheduler specific
                                        properties.ResourceManager will
                                        reload the mapred-queues
                                        configuration file.
 -refreshServiceAcl                     Reload the service-level
                                        authorization policy
                                        fileResoureceManager will reload
                                        the authorization policy file.
 -refreshSuperUserGroupsConfiguration   Refresh superuser proxy groups
                                        mappings.
 -refreshUserToGroupsMappings           Refresh user-to-groups mappings.

Generic options supported are
 -conf <configuration file>         specify a comma separated list of
                                    application configuration files.
 -D <property=value>                use value for given property.
 -rm <local|resourcemanager:port>   specify a resource manager.

The general command line syntax is
yarn command [genericOptions] [commandOptions]
, Here is the good patch (for the fixed usage).
, | Ideally I think we should redo all of the hadoop/hdfs/yarn/mapred commands to have consistent usage and interfaces but that is a much bigger change.

Yes and the command line options of these tools might be confusing sometimes.
In my daily life I am an IT consultant and when I install/train clients on Hadoop, they very often encounter two issues when it comes to using the command line:
 - which options are optional for a specific command (-fs in yarn rmadmin?)
 - where does some arguments must be specified (-Dmapreduce.map.java.opts when submiting a job on command line using hadoop jar).

Maybe the redo could be done in an umbrella JIRA with several issues, one per project?

This message was automatically generated., JobTracker was replaced by ResourceManager by MAPREDUCE-5945. Now the help message is as follows:
{code}
-jt <local|resourcemanager:port>    specify a ResourceManager
{code}
I'm thinking adding a new option {{-rm}} and deprecating {{-jt}} option is fine for me., I just checked and the patch no longer applies to the current trunk. Canceling this patch for now. [~rémy] would you mind to rebase it to the latest trunk? Thanks! , Hi Li Lu,
here it is.

here is the rebased patch.

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~rémy] for updating the patch. Some comments.

1. Would you fix TestGenericOptionsParser?
2. Would you fix the indent size? The indent size is 2 whitespaces.
3. Would you update CommandsManual.md as well?
4. I'm thinking we can remove the deprecated option from command-line help message.
{code}
+    out.println("-jt <local|resourcemanager:port>    specify a ResourceManager (Deprecated)");
{code}

5. The following code can be removed.
{code}
+        	conf.set("yarn.resourcemanager.address", "localhost:8032", 
+                    "from -rm command line option");
{code}, No longer relevant.
