[I see this in TestYarnConfigurationFields.java:

{noformat}
    configurationPropsToSkipCompare
        .add(YarnConfiguration.RM_RESERVATION_SYSTEM_MAX_PERIODICITY);
{noformat}

Looks like we skip requiring this property in yarn-default.xml and it came from YARN-5328.  [~subru], what's the reason for this?  , Generally, we have been following the practice of exposing only what we consider as core configs in yarn-default. All advanced configs, we skip as I feel that we have way too many knobs in the first place., OK.]
