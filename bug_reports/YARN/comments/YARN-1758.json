  at org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.MiniYARNCluster$ResourceManagerWrapper.serviceInit(MiniYARNCluster.java:419), Thank you for reporting, [~hitesh]. I cannot reproduce NPE with a command "mvn test" under hadoop-yarn-project on local. Could you tell me the case this problem occurs?, [~ozawa] The problem is due to the loading of yarn-site.xml and other resources in ResourceManager::serviceInit(). It does not show up in yarn tests as the yarn-site.xml is added into yarn-resourcemanager-tests.jar I believe. However, for all downstream projects, they depend on hadoop-yarn-server-tests-tests.jar for MiniYarnCluster which itself does not have the necessary yarn-site, etc.

I think the fix might be as simple as moving the required configs from hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/test/resources/ to hadoop-yarn-server-tests/src/test/resources/ so that the required confs are bundled in the same tests jar., Do not move the configs out of hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/test/resources/. TestRMAdminService does not use miniYarnCluster and need these configs , Upload a patch to fix this issue, which includes:
1. if Configuration file is not exist, instead of throwing exception, it will simply return null
2. RM, Scheduler or other active services will do the null check before calling conf.addResource(). If the inputStream is NULL (meaning the configuration files are not exist), we will not call conf.addResource() to reload the configuration. In this case, we will get NullPointerException
3. create a testcase to verify that RM can start successfully even we do not provide any configuration files., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~xgong] Have you given though to YARN-1759 as part of this fix?, bq. Xuan Gong Have you given though to YARN-1759 as part of this fix?

I have some comments in YARN-1759. We can start the discussion there. These two tickets are not much related.  , This looks fine enough for me for now. In the interest of progress, let's track YARN-1759 separately.

+1. Checking this in now., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Xuan!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5254 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5254/])
