[This also breaks when trying to create multiple symlinks to the same file, e.g.: {{x#a,x#b,x#c}} only creates the symlink for {{a}} instead of all three.

The problem is Container holds a map from resource Path to symlink String, but there could be multiple symlinks to the same source Path., Patch that changes Container to map pending and localized resources to List<String> instead of String so resources can have multiple symlink destinations., +1 overall.
