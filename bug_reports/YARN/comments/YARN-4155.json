{code}

Note that in the assertion in the source, the expected and actual arguments are in the wrong order. This assert expected "1", but got "-1". 

The patch should include reversing these arguments, and adding some explanatory message to the assert, Attaching patch for the same.
# Windows was not able to run have changed for that
# Assert part have changed as requested.

In locally when i ran its working fine, Attaching same patch again to trigger jenkins, \\

Seems this time {{org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.logaggregation.TestLogAggregationService.testLocalFileDeletionOnDiskFull}} is failing . Checked {{testLogAggregationServiceWithInterval}} in patch. Should i handle {{testLocalFileDeletionOnDiskFull}} in this jira?, Also tried running locally through eclipse its passing in my setup.

Issue YARN-4168 is for the above testcase failure.

Issue YARN-4168 is for the above testcase failure.
Hope  all other changes required are done as part of the patch, Sorry, multiple comments by mistake, Hi [~stevel@apache.org]

Looked into the issue again seems timing issue.

{{TestLogAggregationService#numOfLogsAvailable}} is checked immediately on {{aggregator.doLogAggregationOutOfBand()}} call .
When logaggregation is in progress file name will be with extension *.tmp* 

{{TestLogAggregationService#numOfLogsAvailable}} 
{code}
if (filename.contains(LogAggregationUtils.TMP_FILE_SUFFIX)
          || (lastLogFile != null && filename.contains(lastLogFile)
              && sizeLimited)) {
        LOG.info("fileName :" + filename);
        LOG.info("lastLogFile :" + lastLogFile);
        return -1;
      }
{code}
Returns -1

This message was automatically generated., Please review patch attached, Hi [~rohithsharma]/[~stevel@apache.org]

Could you please review patch attached., were in test code that I don't know my way around, but it seems to work (and isn't going to make things worse), so I'm pretty happy.

one question -why build the path as
{code}
this.remoteRootLogDir.getAbsolutePath().startsWith("/")) ? "file://"
            : "file:///") + this.remoteRootLogDir.getAbsolutePath());
{code}
when {{remoteRootLogDir.toURI().toString()}} should be doing the right thing?, [~stevel@apache.org] Thanks for reviewing patch . Attaching patch after update, \\
