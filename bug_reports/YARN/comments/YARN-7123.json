[Hi, [~templedf]  i have attached a patch, could you review it., Looks generally good.  Before we go fixing the issue, that, I'd like some independent verification that the issue is really an issue.  On the patch, please add a default to the docs for the new property.  Also, it would be better to add a default class to {{FairSchedulerConfiguration}} than to add the dependency on {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration}}., Per offline discussion with [~kasha], it really is an issue, and we don't need it to be configurable.  Let's just make the default be a {{DominantResourceCalculator}} instance., Are there cases where we should not consider all the resources? If not, we should not have a config for this. ]
