[Hello [~sandflee]

Looks like FairSchedulerQueueInfo is accessing child queues in an unsafe way. Can you attach the steps to reproduce this issue? I would like to try to reproduce it in-house and see how to get this fixed. Thank you., enable yarn.scheduler.fair.allow-undeclared-pools, and submit app to non-exsiting queues (we are using a sls-like client) will help reproduce this , I wasn't able to reproduce this on trunk because this was fixed by YARN-4204, mark this one as duplicated.]
