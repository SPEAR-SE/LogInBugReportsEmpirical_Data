[Attached a patch.
- testTransitionToActive failure: Changed to use ArrayList at HAAdmin#getTargetIds. HAAdmin#getTargetIds uses only Arrays.asList, it returns a fixed-size list. So, UnsupportedOperationException occured by calling remove in HAAdmin#isOtherTargetNodeActive.
- testHelp failure: Adjusted space and "--forceactive" message at transitionToActive command usage test., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Hi Kenji,
I applied the patch to trunk and branch-2. The tests still fail, Hi [~mitdesai ], thanks for your testing.
I also tested patch on trunk locally, and confirmed TestRMAdminCLI passed.
This patch contains modification for HAAdmin.java. Please refresh if you didn't refresh o.a.h.ha yet.

, I could reproduce this problem on both trunk and branch-2 and the patch works well both of them on my local. [~mitdesai], can you tell us what command did you run? I ran {{mvn clean test -Dtest=TestRMAdminCLI}} with the patch and it works well., [~ozawa] and [~kj-ki] that was my bad.
My local repo might not have been updated when I tested. I tested the patch and it work fine for me too.

Patch looks good to me.
+1 (non binding), [~mitdesai], Thanks for reporitng. +1 (non-binding), too. [~zjshen], could you take a look, please?, I looked into the patch, which seems to fix the test failure. I spent more time to investigate the context. The test was broken by HDFS-2949, which add the following piece of code:
{code}
    Collection<String> targetIds = getTargetIds(targetNodeToActivate);
    if(targetIds == null) {
      errOut.println("transitionToActive: No target node in the "
          + "current configuration");
      printUsage(errOut, "-transitionToActive");
      return true;
    }
    targetIds.remove(targetNodeToActivate);
{code}

HAAdmin#getTargetIds only adds targetNodeToActivate into targetIds, such that the after this piece of code, targetIds is going to be empty, and HAAdmin#isOtherTargetNodeActive is always returning false (given we fixed the fixed size list issue). Only DFSHAAdmin overrides getTargetIds to add multiple IDs. Therefore, the method doesn't make sense to the HA admin other than that of HDFS, does it?

, [~zjshen]: 
HAAdmin#getTargetIds is a generic function.
In DFSHAAdmin we populate the targetIds with Namenodes.
In RMAdmin, anyone can populate with RMs in future.

[~kj-ki]: +1 for the fix. 
, [~shahrs87], thanks your explanation.

+1 for the fix here. I'll commit the patch. We can also consider to do something similar to what is done for namenode., Committed to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~kj-ki] for the patch, and [~ozawa], [~mitdesai] and [~shahrs87] for the review!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5689 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5689/])
