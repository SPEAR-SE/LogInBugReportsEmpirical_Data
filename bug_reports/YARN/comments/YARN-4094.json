[I have few approaches that I have coded. I am looking for some suggestions. Please grant me contributor right. So that I can put he jira status in progress., I have a working version available. The changes include following:-
1) Modify org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.localizer.sharedcache.SharedCacheUploader.java to chnage uploadFile to encrypt the file while getting copied instream based on yarn service wide property to encrypt sharedcache files.
2) While reading the data the same property is being evaluated to whether read the file after decrypt or read it as it is. FSDownload.java  file in org.apache.hadoop.yarn.util package will be modified to unpack the file accrodingly.

Please suggest if any alternative mechanism exists.]
