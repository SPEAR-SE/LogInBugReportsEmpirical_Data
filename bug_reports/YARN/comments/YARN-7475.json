, Using the {{nodeHttpAddr}} looks like the way to go and it fixes the issue.
Do we still need the {{host}} field? In that case, should it be updated with the {{nodeHttpAddr}} host part?, Thanks [~goirix].

In adapter side of yarn-ui, we have a common abstract.js class which updates host/namespace etc based on server(RM/NM/ATS) and its respective REST end point namespace. Hence a common way for host and namespace was added.

Yes, some of adapters are not overridden from abstract class such as yarn-container-log etc. We planned for a general cleanup to create a better abstract class for all, and its a clean up task pending.

I think current solution clearly fixes bug, and I think its better to handle all this clean up which u mentioned to be handled as a common cleanup jira as its not a functionality change or behavior

, That sounds good.
The clean up could be done later.

Tested it in a small cluster and it looks good.
