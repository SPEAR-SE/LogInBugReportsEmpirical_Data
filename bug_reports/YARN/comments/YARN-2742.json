+1 in terms of using \s* to cover these cases.

I'm comfortable with also making the unit match case-insensitive, but I'd like to hear others' thoughts on that., Thanks for the comments, [~sjlee0]. Any comments, [~kasha]?, [~ywskycn], thanks for contribution. How about adding a test case to include trailing space like " 1024 mb, 4 core "?, Thanks, [~ozawa]. Update a patch to add that testcase., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
