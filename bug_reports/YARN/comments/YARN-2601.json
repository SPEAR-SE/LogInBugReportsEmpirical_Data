[RMactiveService entered STOPPED state before going active, which prevent RM from going active. 
Neither of the two HA RMs configured can go active., Hi [~cindy2012], This looks to be similar of YARN-2588. In your issue also transtionToActive throw exception one time. After that RM can't not enter active state because RMActiveService already in stopped state. 

But here one thing need to check that why transition failed with below exception?(In YARN-2588, failed with ZK exception session expired)
*Caused by: org.apache.hadoop.security.token.SecretManager$InvalidToken: hadoop tried to renew an expired token*, As a workaround, we deleted the entries in /rmstore/ZKRMStateRoot/RMAppRoot and restarted the RMs. Looks like that fixed the issue., [~cindy2012] This will be fixing in YARN-2010. Please follow this jira.]
