[The installation documentation for Hadoop yarn at this link http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html has error in the yarn-site for property yarn.nodemanager.aux-services. it should be  mapreduce_shuffle rather than mapreduce.shuffle., Thank you for reporting, Siddharth. The point you mentioned is now being fixed on HADOOP-10050. Please watch it and have discussion there if you have any comments. Again, thanks!
