This message is automatically generated., I don't think this does what you want.  Now an IOException will cause the same issue.  I think you need to handle runtime and IOException separately. , Doh, you're right.  It was a test, and you passed!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

, Bobby, the fix went in a little too fast for any of us to notice, you should give others a bit of time to be able to look at it. Tx.

While this is a quick fix that should help, we should think of more long term solutions - specifically looking for correct exceptions etc. After our recent exception work, mainly after YARN-628 and MAPREDUCE-5254, we can look for IOException specifically. Is that enough?, Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #212 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/212/])

, Vinod,

Yes creating and resolving a JIRA in 2 hours is not ideal, but this is a Blocker that consisted on only a handful of lines of change, also the bylaws explicitly state that a waiting period is not needed for this vote because committers can retroactively -1 and pull the change out.  I agree that waiting to let others look at the code is good and if it were not a Blocker I would have waited.]
