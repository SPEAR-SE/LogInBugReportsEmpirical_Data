[hi [~gu chi] thanks for reporting the issue. 

{quote}but the parent process which persisted as container pid no longer exist, so the kill command can not reach the container process.{quote}
Although parent process does not exist, corresponding process group does exist, then *SIGKILL* will be delivered to the process group, so *SIGKILL* could reach the container's rest processes. Could you explain it more? Thanks., Thanks for reply, the process group I not realize, this seems introduced by myself, I add a condition of check if container-executor process exist as I once meet with YARN-3678, in my logic, if parent process not belong to this container, will not signal kill, I saw you also faced same issue, is your patch can deal with that scenario and also will not introduce this issue?, [~gu chi] Thanks for explaining it. Yes, we also came across the problem, and have applied the patch in YARN-4459, it works well now. I explained more in that issue's comments. Maybe you could help review and try it. Thanks., As analyzed further, this is introduced by some custom modification, sorry if bother.]
