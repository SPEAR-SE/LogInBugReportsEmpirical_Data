[I would also suggest to deprecate existing "yarn.resourcemanager.cluster-id" and rename to "yarn.cluster.id" because cluster ID now is a broader concept than just for election of RMs., "yarn.cluster.id" sounds good to me., Editing title to be appropriate.

Others commented on YARN-3040. So I'll try to summarize the discussion from YARN-1029 and YARN-3040.
 - We should have a generic {{yarn.cluster-id}} and deprecate the current RM only configuration
 - We need to have a reasonable default cluster-id
    -- This is needed for the Timeline service functionality - we want to gather insights per cluster
    -- Forcing admins to set the ID explicitly is one more hurdle w.r.t configuration
    -- For single node non-HA clusters, forcing the dev/admin to set it is unnecessary.
 - But there are concerns too
    -- Default cluster-id can potentially cause hard-to-debug issues in HA mode.
 - Other constraints while picking a default cluster ID
    -- Restarting RM on the same node shouldn't change the cluster-id

So, I propose that we set the default cluster-ID to be something like "default-$(RM-host-name)-cluster". This way
 - by default, single node clusters are good across RM restarts, unless you are running active/standby RMs on the same machine (dev environments)
 - HA RMs have to be setup explicitly to be part of the same cluster - thereby avoiding debuggability issues.
 - For real life use, in order to facilitate RM migrations, administrators will set their own cluster-id., Thanks, Vinod! This proposal sounds almost good to me, but I think we need to rethink what's the default cluster ID.  "default-$(RM-host-name)-cluster" may not work because "yarn.resourcemanager.hostname" is 0.0.0.0 by default, such that different RMs may still use the same cluster ID. Even if we use IP address to lookup host name, it's likely to end up with the same "localhost".]
