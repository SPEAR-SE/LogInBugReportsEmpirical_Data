This message is automatically generated., [~ted_yu], Thanks for the reporting. I checked the code path. Current code looks correct. If the tryCloseProxy() succeeds, the sleeping threads will be waken up and try to register the proxy instance as cache entry. If wait() have the timeout value, the sleeping threads are waken up before cmProxy.size() is updated. It looks consumption of CPU resource since there are no change between before and after the sleep. What do you think? Please let me know if I have some missing points.
, Resolving according to feedback., Thank you, Ted!]
