[It turns out that this is a real bug introduced by YARN-7095.  {{RouterWebServiceUtil#mergeMetrics}} takes into two sets of metrics and merges them into the first one.  However, for a number of the metrics, it actually simply doubles the first metric.  For example
{code:java}
metrics.setTotalNodes(metrics.getTotalNodes() + metrics.getTotalNodes());
{code}
should be
{code:java}
metrics.setTotalNodes(metrics.getTotalNodes() + metricsResponse.getTotalNodes());
{code}

This should have failed every time, but the test also had a "flaw", which only made it flakey.  The test initializes two sets of metrics to random values using different {{Random}} objects using {{System.getCurrentTimeMillis()}} for the seed.  However, the code is fast enough that it often takes less than 1ms, causing the two objects to use the same seed.  When this happens, the two sets of metrics have the same values, and will mask the bug I described earlier.  If the code is slower (e.g. GC pause, swapping, adding a log statement for the seed, etc), then you'll get different seed values and the test will (correctly) fail.

The 001 patch fixes the bug by using the correct metric in {{RouterWebServiceUtil#mergeMetrics}}.  And it fixes the test by ensuring that the two seeds will be different.  It also cleans up some formatting and logs the seed for better debugability., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |

, +1. Will commit it shortly, Thanks [~rkanter] for the patch. I have committed it to trunk and branch-3.0., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13098 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13098/])
YARN-7341. TestRouterWebServiceUtil#testMergeMetrics is flakey. (Robert (haibochen: rev acabc657ff5433f36ce1b238cecd3a3b5bbe87ae)
* (edit) hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-router/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/router/webapp/RouterWebServiceUtil.java
* (edit) hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-router/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/router/webapp/TestRouterWebServiceUtil.java
, [~haibochen] does this need to go into branch-2 as well?  YARN-7095 was also committed to branch-2, and IIUC that means branch-2 has the same problem as reported here.
, [~jlowe], neither the {{mergeMetrics}} method nor the test exist in branch-2, so I figured that YARN-7095 had a different patch for branch-2.  But looking at the git history now, it looks like it's not actually in branch-2 at all:

Either YARN-7095 has the wrong fix version or someone forgot to backport it.  [~subru]?, Ah, sorry, I was simply going off of the JIRA versions and should have looked at the code.  Thanks for the clarification.  Guess we'll wait to hear from Subru on what branch-2 is supposed to look like wrt. YARN-7095.
, Thanks [~rkanter]/[~jlowe] for bringing this to my attention. I cherry-picked this along with YARN-7095 to branch-2., Thanks [~subru].]
