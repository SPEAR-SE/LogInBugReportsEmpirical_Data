This message is automatically generated., Simple class removal, it should be fine without additional tests., This was added in MAPREDUCE-279, when we originally open-sourced YARN. Checked with [~sseth] too and we've no idea of its purpose. We may need it for rolling-upgrades, but can add it as and when it is really needed.

+1 for this. Checking it in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.1. Thanks Zhijie!

Marked this incompatible just in case some alpha user was using it. Just in case., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3940 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3940/])
