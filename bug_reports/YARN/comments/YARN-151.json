[The most straight forward fix would be upgrading to a more recent version of datatables and turn on defered rendering (not creating dom nodes for all rows, even they are hidden): http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/ajax/defer_render.html

Sorting, searching through in js itself can easily handle up to 100k rows on modest hardware., @Luke: Even if we used deferred rendering, it seems like we would still need to ship all that data to the browser, even if the user doesn't require it (e.g. the very first page of the JHS)

Wouldn't server side be better? http://datatables.net/release-datatables/examples/data_sources/server_side.html It seems to be designed for exactly our use case., 10k apps is a small amount of data (a few hundred KB to a few MB) and that you don't need implement the logic (api that supports searching/sorting/paging) at server side and that you have better user response time (instant search experience) as the data is at the client side. The server side stuff would be better if we need to support more than 100K apps. If you come up with a patch, I'm happy to review it :), Hi Luke! Thanks a lot for your prompt reply. :) 20000 jobs on the JHS resulted in a ~13 Mb file. (I can see that there's a lot of whitespace in the file, which we can probably get rid of). Anyway, I timed how much time it takes for the browser to download and render this on my machine. It took about 35 seconds. When I rendered the locally saved file, it took 11 seconds. Here's an HTML file containing a table with 20000 rows. It again took 12 seconds. 

It seems to me that the majority of the time (35-12) was taken in downloading the file. I don't know why it would take so long, but it did :(

I'll try to do some more tests with DataTables with deferred rendering. If that is fast, I would like it too, so that I can graph that data in MAPREDUCE-4747. Killing two stones with 1 bird (since I don't like killing birds), Ok Luke! I'm convinced. Deferred rendering is AWESOME! :) Attaching the small test file(s) I made. 20,000 rows, rendered in 1-2 seconds. I even tried 200,000 rows. That took 5-6 seconds.

Do we know how much we want the JHS to scale? Ideally ofcourse we'd like to keep all the jobs that have ever been run, and for that, we might want to use server_side, but deferred rendering seems fine for now.

I'll work on creating a patch for using deferred rendering in the mean time. Thanks a ton!, The same patch applies to all 3 branches : 0.23, branch-2, trunk, Can someone please review and commit this?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
