[I see two initial high-level approaches to this problem:
# Add all resources from the public and private cache to the retention set at the same time. Then resources across all caches will be removed using an LRU eviction strategy.
# Use separate retention sets for the public and private caches. This way, an admin can set separate retention sizes for the public and private cache. Furthermore, the caches will be isolated from each other and a large file being localized in a user cache will not cause churn in the public cache or visa versa.

Currently I am leaning towards #2. Please let me know your thoughts! Thanks., Attached is a v1 patch for trunk.

In this initial patch I actually went with approach #1.

Here is a summary of the modifications this patch makes:
# Renamed the {{ResourceRetentionSet}} class to {{LocalCacheCleaner}}. In the patch it looks like a delete/add.
# Modified {{LocalCacheCleaner#addResources}} so that it only adds resources to the map and does not clean.
# Added a new method {{LocalCacheCleaner#cleanCache}} that is actually responsible for cleaning the cache. The general intention is that you would add a bunch of resources to the cleaner, and then call clean. All resources that the cleaner is aware of at that point will get cleaned up on an LRU basis.
# Added a new stats class to {{LocalCacheCleaner}} that keeps track of the same stats {{ResourceRetentionSet}} did, plus an optional more detailed breakdown of what was cleaned from private caches.
# Added a new test class {{TestLocalCacheCleanup}}. This tests a basic cleanup, a cleanup where there are resources with positive ref counts, tests that the cleaner is indeed using an LRU policy across both private and public caches, and finally tests that the cleanup stats are correct.
# Deleted the {{TestRetentionSet}} class because it is now redundant with {{TestLocalCacheCleanup}}.

Please let me know your thoughts! If there is too much going on in the patch, I can always break it down into smaller ones. Thanks.

, +1 (non-binding) Thank you, [~ctrezzo]!

I have a few optional comments:

testLRUAcrossTrackers:
The test does not check whether the right resource was deleted from each list. 
You might want to use resources.getLocalRsrc().containsKey here just like in testPositiveRefCount.

LocalCacheCleanerStats:
It would be useful in the future for debugging, if toStringDetailed() printed out the actual resource paths not just the size per user
, Thanks for the patch, Chris!  Looks good overall, just some minor nits in addition to the unit test comment above.  I don't think the actual resource path logging is necessary since LocalResourcesTrackerImpl already does this in its remove method.  If this does get added here, please make it a trace-level log separate from the debug one.

LocalCacheCleaner should be a package-private class.  It does not need to be public.

handleCacheCleanup takes an event that isn't used and should be removed.  Looks like this was in the original code as well, but it would be nice to cleanup while we're here.

Why does LRUComparator implement Serializable?  It doesn't really do it properly and appears to be unnecessary.

LocalCacheCleanerStats should take the currentSize as a constructor argument which can be used to initialize cacheSizeBeforeClean.  As a bonus, cacheSizeBeforeClean can then be marked final.

I'm curious why we're removing the map entry here:
{code}
      if (tracker.remove(resource, delService)) {
        stats.incDelSize(tracker.getUser(), resource.getSize());
        i.remove();
      }
{code}
The removal seems unnecessary.  Is the concern that someone will create a long-term cache cleaner object that will hold onto these LocalizedResource objects?  If so then it would be simpler and faster to just clear the entire resourceMap at the end of the method, since we don't really support reusing a cleaner object.
, Thanks for the reviews [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] and [~jlowe]!

bq. You might want to use resources.getLocalRsrc().containsKey here just like in testPositiveRefCount.
[~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] Ack, I will add the check to testLRUAcrossTrackers.

bq. Why does LRUComparator implement Serializable? It doesn't really do it properly and appears to be unnecessary.
I agree that it is unnecessary since we never serialize LRUComparator or the map that we add it to. This is a result of the old code and our findbugs check. There were a couple of modifications I made to the LRUComparator class to satisfy findbugs:
# The comparator interface forces you to implement the equals method (how the original code was implemented), but does not force you to add a hashcode implementation. Findbugs now flags this. The original implementation of the equals method was implemented incorrectly (compares object references), but I left it because we never compare comparators in the code. To appease findbugs, I added an identity hashcode implementation that paired with the original implementation of the equals method. In hindsight, maybe I should just fix the original implementation of the equals method and add a correct hashcode implementation as well. [~jlowe], it seems a little unnecessary because our code never uses it, so I would be curious to hear your thoughts.
# Findbugs flags the original LRUComparator for implementing the comparator interface, but not implementing Serializable. The argument is that if the comparator is not serializable and it is added to a map, then the map is not serializable. The LRUComparator has no member variables, so I figured all I had to do was declare it serializable and add a serial version number. [~jlowe], should I add default write/read object methods as well? Thanks!

bq. Is the concern that someone will create a long-term cache cleaner object that will hold onto these LocalizedResource objects? If so then it would be simpler and faster to just clear the entire resourceMap at the end of the method, since we don't really support reusing a cleaner object.
Maybe? This was just copied from the original ResourceRetentionSet class. I can delete the remove call and clear the entire resourceMap at the end of {{cleanCache}}.

I will also address the other comments. Thanks again for the reviews!, Ah, I missed the findbugs connection with respect to comparator serialization.  In that case I'm fine with leaving that in, since the alternative of adding a findbugs exception is about as much work.  No need to do read/write object methods.
, Thanks for the patch [~ctrezzo]! I agree with the above feedback from Jason and Mikios.

Just a couple of more minor comments.

1. Let's make {{LRUComparator}} a private static class. This doesn't need to be visible outside {{LocalCacheCleaner}}.
2. Can we remove {{LocalCacheCleanerStats.getUserDelSizes()}}? This publishes the internal map and breaks the encapsulation. It doesn't appear to be used by any code.
3. Please use a generated {{serialVersionUID}} value instead of a hard-coded value of 1., Attached is a v4 patch for trunk addressing all comments from the reviews. Thanks!, Two notes:
# Instead of removing {{LocalCacheCleanerStats.getUserDelSizes()}} I made it return an unmodifiable map. That way, users of the class still have access to the data (outside of the toString method) and it is still protected.
# I wound up removing both {{LRUComparator.equals}} and {{LRUComparator.hashCode}}. I figure we don't need to override them since the methods were just using the default implementation anyways.

My intention is to file a followup jira that adds metrics that expose the statistics from {{LocalCacheCleanerStats}}., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
