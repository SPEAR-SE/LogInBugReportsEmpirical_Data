[There are 2 ways to fix this.
1. Add a macro {{#set ( $H3 = '###' )}}
2. Rename *.md.vm to *.md.

I'm +1 for the latter., Hi [~ajisakaa]

Thanks for filing this issue, I renamed this file to .md.vm in YARN-7959 because it needs to do proper filtering on the version variables. So I prefer #1 to fix this. I can take of this if you don't mind.

Agreed. I don't mind if you take this issue., Uploaded the patch to fix this, verified on a local build. Please see a screenshot

!fix_missing_H3_titles.jpg! Or you can manually run
{code:java}
mvn site -Preleasedocs; mvn site:stage -DstagingDirectory=/tmp/hadoop-site/
{code}
to verify.

Thanks, +1, thanks [~cheersyang]!, Not sure why jenkins job was not triggered, re-upload the patch and see., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
