[Currently, RMDelegationTokenSecretManager doesn't implement updateMasterKey at all. , right, thats the thing we should add in this jira., took a closer look, looks like RMDelegationTokenSecretManager just creates a new DelegationKey znode each time the new key is generated. I think we are fine here.. close this.]
