[bq. Monitors don't handle preemption.

[They|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/monitor/SchedulingEditPolicy.java] [do|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/monitor/capacity/ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy.java#L82]., Thanks for the correction, [~chris.douglas]. The comment isn't precise anyway. It doesn't handle FS preemption. Besides that, monitors handle something like invariant check other than preemption. We need to revise or remove this comment anyway.]
