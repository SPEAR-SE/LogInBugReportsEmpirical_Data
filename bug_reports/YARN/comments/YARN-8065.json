[Black Listing of nodes are not happening in the following scenariosÂ 
 # RMAppattempt is in ALLOCATED and LAUNCH_FAILED event comes when NM is down.
 # RMAppattempt is in LAUNCHED nad EXPIRE event comes when NM is down.

In both these cases AppAttempt goes to FINAL_SAVING and eventually to FINAL state before CONTAINER_FINISHED event is triggered by RMContainerImpl and in the FINAL state CONTAINER_FINISHED event is ignored., cc [~jlowe]]
