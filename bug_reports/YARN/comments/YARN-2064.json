[Hi  [~dlim1234], the message should be only saying some containers(map or reduce tasks) were killed by the AM during the runtime of AM. As long as you can see the SUCCEED state on the RM web UI, the job should be successful. You can also use yarn application -status to query the app status from CLI.

Also, please ask such questions in Hadoop user group mailing list rather than here next time. JIRA site is supposed to be used for reporting issues not for answering general questions. thanks., Closed this.]
