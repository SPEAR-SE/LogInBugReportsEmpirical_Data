[I am able to reproduce this in eclipse randomly, looking into root reason. , In serviceStop() , eventHandlingThread is interrupted and join for thread to complete. In test case, DrainDispatcher used which create its own thread. But real issue for randomness is when thread.Interupt is called, it is not madatory that thread will get interrupt unless thread is blocked.  So there should be mechanism to exit thread by setting boolean flag in while loop.
Updated the patch for handling this. I run the test many times, it is able to run without getting hang.

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~zjshen], kindly review the analysis and patch, After [YARN-1121|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/EditComment!default.jspa?id=12666077&commentId=13808704], AsyncDispatcher already has the draining logic, but only doesn't provide await() method to users. The bug you have found with DrainDispatcher seems to be handled properly in AsyncDispatcher. How about removing the overriding methods in DrainDispatcher, and only adding await()?, bq. The bug you have found with DrainDispatcher seems to be handled properly in AsyncDispatcher
Yes, it is handled.

bq. How about removing the overriding methods in DrainDispatcher, and only adding await()?
This I was thought initially before uploading current patch. But since visibility of instance variable  *drained* will change from private to protected only for test framework. Given it is accepted, we can change visibility., I can think of having public boolean isDrained() in AsynDispatcher for getting drained status and do the same logic. I will try to run all the tests with above change for impact and will upload new patch., bq. I can think of having public boolean isDrained() in AsynDispatcher for getting drained status
