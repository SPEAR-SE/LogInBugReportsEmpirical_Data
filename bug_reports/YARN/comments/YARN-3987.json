This message was automatically generated., Hi, [~sandflee], below code in the sendAMContainerToNM method should send the container complete msg over.  Is getKeepContainersAcrossApplicationAttempts true in your case?
{code}
    if (!appAttempt.getSubmissionContext()
      .getKeepContainersAcrossApplicationAttempts()) {
      appAttempt.sendFinishedContainersToNM();
    }
  }
{code}, yes, we set getKeepContainersAcrossApplicationAttempts true, thanks for your review., bq. leaving too many completed container(AM container) in NM. 
At a single point of time,there should be only one AM instance in NM. Do you mean the old AM containers are not cleaned up ?

If AM cannot be launched, the AM will expire in 10 mins, in which case the containers should also be cleanedup.

This message was automatically generated., Yes the old AM container in NM aren't cleaned up. in our case, AM crashed after it starts,  RM will create a new appAttempt and launch a new AM and will not expire,  it leaves the complete container in NM memory and NM stateStore. we set max-am-attempt to a very large num so the completed am container in NM bombs.  
For AM completed container, RM could send ack msg to NM, seems no need to wait for new AM to pull complete msg. and your idea? [~jianhe], AM crashes before it register to RM , Committed to trunk and branch-2,  thanks [~sandflee] !, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8296 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8296/])
