[@Vinod , how about conservatively changing max attempts to 2, if there's no strong motivation to give AM multiple retry chances?, I've drafted a patch, which includes the following modifications:

1. Change the default value of yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts from 1 to 2.

2. In the test cases, where more than one attempt is set, YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_AM_MAX_ATTEMPTS is used instead of the hard-coding values.

3. Assert the set maxAttempts > 1 where one and more than one will make difference., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I think that the global default should be one because an app attempt can fail due to a large number of user level reasons and should not be retried. The system should retry an attempt upon hardware failure or YARN error and set this default to 1.]
