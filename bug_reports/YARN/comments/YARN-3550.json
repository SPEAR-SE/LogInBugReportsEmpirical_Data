[Error messages would be nice, but this is happening inside Jersey, and it doesn't believe in error messages or much resembling diagnostics itself. Unless there's a way to make it more informative, this will have to be a CANTFIX. Sorry. We all suffer from this, Closing as CANTFIX; this is happening in the servlet layer before it gets as far as our REST APIs. All of those we catch exceptions, convert to HTTP error codes, log, etc, etc. Jersey gets in early with its issues (locating the destination classes, unmarshalling datatypes &c), and our REST endpoints don't even get told of the problems.

Sorry.]
