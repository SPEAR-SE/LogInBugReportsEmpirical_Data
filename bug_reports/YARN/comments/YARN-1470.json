[It's essential for YARN app test, so: public + unstable would be my recommendation, Agreed it's essential.  My inclination would be to make it Public/Evolving (or maybe even Stable?) - we don't want to break people's tests in a 2.x release., avoid committing to stable; evolving better -but leave alone for 2.x, Added Public/Evolving annotations to MiniYARNCluster, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
