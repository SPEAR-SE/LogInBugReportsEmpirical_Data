[[~zjshen] [~vinodkv] [~jeagles] Please let me know your comments. , [~zjshen] Is there any thinking of how acls will work with v2? Can you either move this into the v2 sub-tasks or create a new jira and close this out as a wont-fix assuming v1 will not be enhanced., [~hitesh], we haven't sort out the security details for ATS v2, and so far we just have a uber jira for v2 security, but we can elaborate it later.

You're correct, we're no longer developing new feature for TS v1. We can close this jira., [~zjshen] Please create a dup of this with the relevant info so that it is considered for the v2 design. I will close this one out. ]
