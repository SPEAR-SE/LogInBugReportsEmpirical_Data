This message is automatically generated., Comments: 
   - missing changes in yarn-default.xml 
   - question regarding NodeInfo which reports totalPMem and totalVMem - is the expectation that it should return the actual configured value or -1 if memory checks are disabled? The node information sent to the RM in the heartbeat is the actual amount whereas the NM UI seems to be displaying something else. Does it makes sense to add the memory monitoring flags as separate bits of information? 
      - this could allow a function like isPhysicalMemoryCheckEnabled to just return the flag instead of overloading the totalPMemValue when monitoring is disabled. 
   - is this needed: s/YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_PMEM_MB) * 1024 * 1024/YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_PMEM_MB) * 1024 * 1024L/ ? ( missing long qualifier on the last 1024 ) ?
