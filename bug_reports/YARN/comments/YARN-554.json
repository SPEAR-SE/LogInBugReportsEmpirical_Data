[is this valid on trunk?, Hi... [~wuzesheng] I tried running map reduce job using yarn (latest trunk) on single node cluster in secured environment. I have turned on shortcircuit for hdfs client. I don't see any exception while running the job. Let me know if you still see this issue. If yes then please attach your conf files, RM/NM/AM logs.

{code}
...hdfs-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.client.read.shortcircuit</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>dfs.domain.socket.path</name>
    <value>/home/hdfs/shortCircuit</value>
  </property>
</configuration>

....core-site.xml

<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.security.authentication</name>
    <value>kerberos</value>
  </property>
