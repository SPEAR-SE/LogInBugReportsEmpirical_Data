[Similarly If you run hadoop applications e.g. without settings hadoop.http.filter.initializers with timelineserver enabled
e.g :
{code}
hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.5.0.2.2.0.0-532.jar pi 10 10
{code}

Application submission fails with following type of excpetion:
{code}

This message is automatically generated., The patch should work, but we can improve the logic a bit.

{code}
-    if (!actualInitializers.equals(initializers)) {
+    if (!actualInitializers.equals(initializers) || modifiedInitialiers) {
{code}

We can set modifiedInitialiers = true when TimelineAuthenticationFilterInitializer is added and AuthenticationFilterInitializer is skipped. These are only two possible changes.

Then, we don't need to check !actualInitializers.equals(initializers) , but only modifiedInitialiers in the aforementioned condition.

Can you add one more case:
{code}
+    driver.put("", TimelineAuthenticationFilterInitializer.class.getName());
