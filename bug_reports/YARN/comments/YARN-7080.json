[I think this may be essentially a duplicate of YARN-6647.  I've seen various Test*WithRMHA fail due to the badly handled InterruptedException in ZKRMStateStore that ends up tearing down the AsyncDispatcher.  The QA bot doesn't always know the difference between a surefire test timeout and a test calling System.exit.  The latter is what I believe is what's happening here.
