[Attaching patch to fix yarn.cmd.  I also needed to add a special case for the classpath sub-command so that it wouldn't try to dispatch to java.  This is identical to how it's handled in hadoop.cmd., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

All changes are in scripts, so there are no new tests.  I manually tested this patch in a running Windows cluster by running all yarn.cmd sub-commands and one additional direct class to cover the passthrough case., +1, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

It looks like the Jenkins box is overloaded.  It can't fork a new thread.  This patch only contains cmd script changes, so there is no way it can make javac fail.
