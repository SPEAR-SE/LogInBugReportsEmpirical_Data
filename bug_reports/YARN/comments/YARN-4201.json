This message was automatically generated., Could anyone help review it please?, Thanks for the patch [~hex108]! It is a good catch.
Should we use {{SchedulerNode#getNodeName}} to get the blacklisted node name?
We can add {{getSchedulerNode}} to {{YarnScheduler}}, So we can call {{getSchedulerNode}} to look up the the SchedulerNode using NodeId in {{RMAppAttemptImpl}}.
, Currently {{getSchedulerNode}} is defined at {{AbstractYarnScheduler}}. {{SchedulerAppUtils.isBlacklisted}} uses {{node.getNodeName()}} to check blacklisted node. So it will be good to use the same way to get blacklisted node name. All the configuration and format related to node name will be only in SchedulerNode.java., Thanks [~zxu] for the review and very valuable suggestion. The code is more clean now.

Attach a new patch to address your comment., Thanks for the new patch [~hex108], I think it will be better to check {{scheduler.getSchedulerNode(nodeId)}} not null to avoid NPE.
If {{scheduler.getSchedulerNode(nodeId)}} return null, it means the blacklisted node is just removed from scheduler, I think it will be ok to not add a removed node to black List., Thanks [~zxu] for the good catch. Attach a new patch to address the problem., \\
