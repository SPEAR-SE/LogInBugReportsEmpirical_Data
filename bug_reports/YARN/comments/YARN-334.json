[We used to have similar issues in Oozie, we sorted this out by having the root POM do all the RAT reporting and all the children POM to do nothing.

In the root POM:

{code}
            <plugin>
                <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
                <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
                <configuration>
                    <excludeSubProjects>false</excludeSubProjects>
                    <excludes>
                        <exclude>.gitignore</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/*iml</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/target/**</exclude>
                        <exclude>**/build/**</exclude>
                        <!-- you may need to add some files deep in modules -->
                    </excludes>
                </configuration>
            </plugin>
{code}

And in all the other POMs:

{code}
            <plugin>
                 <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
                 <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
                 <configuration>
                     <excludeSubProjects>false</excludeSubProjects>
                     <excludes>
                         <!-- excluding all as the root POM does the full check-->
                         <exclude>**</exclude>
                     </excludes>
                 </configuration>
             </plugin>
{code}, sorry I think I missed something, why is the root pom having all the excludes better then at each level?, In the first snippet (in root pom), the *<excludeSubProjects>false</excludeSubProjects>* makes RAT to walk ALL dirs even if they are submodules. in the second snippet (in all submodules), the *<exclude>****</exclude>* makes RAT (when running in that module) to do a NOP.  This means that effectively is the root POM the only one running RAT, so all exclusions must be there. 

The other benefit of this approach (actually this was the main reason why we did it) it to have a single RAT report for the whole project., So I understood the pom files themselves how they worked.  I was wondering why you chose to only have it in the root pom.xml. Because right now I'm doing it so that each component pom file has the excludes in it.  I don't see the technical difference in those approaches. If there is a big benefit in having one report I can change, but on the other hand if we ever split projects apart again putting them in the component pom files makes more sense.  Right now my current patch has it split. I'm just finishing testing it.  I will change if you or others prefer the one?, When creating release artifacts in Oozie we produce TARBALL, MD5, SIGNATURE, CHANGES and RAT files. Having a single RAT file with the total summary is much easier to verify. Anyway, was not my intention to derail your work, I was just volunteering information :)., thanks Alejandro.

There are a couple of files here that have other licenses/copyrights in them. Anyone know what the right thing to do with those is?
