[[~sunilg] Thanks for reporting the issue. Please see [the doc of Jersey 1.19|https://jersey.java.net/apidocs/1.19/jersey/com/sun/jersey/api/client/ClientResponse.html#getClientResponseStatus()], not one of 1.9 because we upgraded Jersey to 1.19. Feel free to ask me about the update of dependency.

, Thank you very much [~ozawa] for the details.
I checked in my environment and found that i have  *jersey-client-1.9.jar* under my M2_REPO. Do I need to delete this jar manually, but correct client has to picked automatically from the pom, rt?, [~sunilg] How about executing {{mvn clean install test -Dtest=TestRMWebServices}}? It works on my local without cleaning jersey-client-1.9.jar. If it doesn't work, it might be useful to clean M2_REPO as ad-hoc solution on an empirical basis., Thank you [~ozawa]. It was helpful. I think my project settings was still with 1.9 (I had to change to 1.19) and cleared M2_REPO. It looks fine. I will close this issue, Thank you very much for helping and clarifying.]
