[To fix this I have created a new profile called {{enable-yarn-server-test-module}} in hadoop-yarn-server pom.

To include this module for one has to pass the {{-Penable-yarn-server-test-module}} during compilation, Use -DskipTests in addition to -Dmaven.test.skip=true, Thanks for reply Allen. 

Actually I am using both  -DskipTests in addition to -Dmaven.test.skip=true. The problem comes when I use -Dmaven.test.skip=true which restricts the test code compilation. For this comment sake let me allow to tell that maven.test.skip option skip both the test code compilation and test case execution whereas skipTests skips only execution (not compilation).

This may sound unethical to compile source code without compiling test source code and in-fact for open source community this may never be a scenario. But I ran into one requirement wherein my Continuous Integration environment, I have to make a complete build as fast as possible where every minute counts. In such a case disabling the test code compilation saves close to 3 to 4 minutes.
, I realize that my patch enforces to use the {{-Penable-yarn-server-test-module}} option to have normal builds. This is my bad. Rather, I will provide a patch tomorrow which have the switch like {{-Pdisable-yarn-server-test-module}} using which hadoop-yarn-server-test project can be skipped from the build. 

Please let me know if it sounds ok !!!

, So then "mvn compile" is actually what you want.... (I think) :)]
