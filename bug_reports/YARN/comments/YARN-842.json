[This seems relevant http://stackoverflow.com/questions/9433789/users-report-occasional-message-message-json-is-undefined. Was your IE also IE7?, My IE Version is : 8.0.7601.17514, Unable to view the jobs in IE9 both at RM and JHS UI.
Currently using hadoop-2.1.0-beta version.
IE version :9.0.8112.16421

Attached screenshots of RM and JHS UI

, Following Harsh J's advise,a different error occurs :

Any suggestions?
, I verified in the IE9 and greater, able to view the applicaitons. Does this issue still anyone facing in community? else can it be closed?, It is working fine in the latest, closing it now. Please reopen if you still see this issue. Thanks.]
