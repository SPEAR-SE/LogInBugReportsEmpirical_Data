[Hi [~cindy2012], which version of hadoop build are you using? In older version i.e 2.4, RM HA introduced.It was not meant for recovering running jobs.
Work preserving restart feature done in YARN-556. If you are already using latest version then configuring peroperty {{yarn.resourcemanager.work-preserving-recovery.enabled}} enables work preserving for running jobs., As mentioned by [~rohithsharma], this problem should be addressed after  YARN-556. Please reopen it if you still have the problem.]
