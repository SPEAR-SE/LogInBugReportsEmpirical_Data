[See YARN-2424., Thank you Allen.  By using the fix in YARN-2424, it is possible to run application as submitted user.  Proxy user concept could be an enhancement to ensure only a small set of users have privileges to run core services.  Such as Spark on YARN or HBase on YARN, those users are supposely trusted services.  Some proxy user rules in YARN can help to reduce the security risk that YARN-1253 was originally concerned about.]
