[git bisect narrows this down to YARN-7619.  A "res" field was added to the ResourceInfo DAO object, and since all fields are advertised by default it incorrectly appears in query output.  The trunk version of ResourceInfo does not automatically advertise fields by default.
, trunk and other releases ahead of 2.8 do not do this since they changed the annotation of the ResourceInfo class from XmlAccessType.FIELD to XmlAccessType.NONE in YARN-6232 when the same Resource field was added to ResourceInfo.  branch-2.8 needs a similar setup so the "res" field is not advertised in the REST API.
