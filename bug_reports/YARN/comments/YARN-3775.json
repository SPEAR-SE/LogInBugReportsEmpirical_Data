[log of resource manager and node manager,  ..../etc/hadoop
command output of terasort , [~xiachengshun@yeah.net] Thanks for reporting the issue. IIUC, This is expected behavior
If the Application attempt is killed because of the following reason, then current attempt failure is not considered as attempt failures count. 
# Preempted
# Aborted
# Disk_failed(i.e NM unhealthy)
# killed by ResourceManager.

In your case, applicaitons attempt got killed because of disk_failed, which RM never consider this as attempt failure. So RM wait for this applications to launch and run in further NM register to it., Closing as Not A Problem. Please Reopen if you disagree..]
