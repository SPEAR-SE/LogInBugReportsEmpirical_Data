[Attached a sample patch for YARN/MR documentation. Multihoming.apt.vm format is same as HDFS-6712. Thanks., Thanks for the contribution [~kj-ki]. Perhaps instead of three different docs and duplicated content we can have a single doc with HDFS, YARN and MR settings and have it under common. We can remove the content from the current HDFS doc and leave a forwarding link to the common doc. What do you think?

[~cwelch], would you be able to verify the yarn/mr content for accuracy?]
