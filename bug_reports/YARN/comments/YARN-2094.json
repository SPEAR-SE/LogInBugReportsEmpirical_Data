[Hi Nikhil, 
     Welcome to Hadoop community.
     bq. When I browse through the web page for job counters, there are no job counters.
           Which web page are you browsing? Counters link is available in HistoryServer web page,top left Job popdown menu. Make sure history server is running. You can access jobcounter page in link *http://<mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.address>/jobhistory/jobcounters/<job-id>*
