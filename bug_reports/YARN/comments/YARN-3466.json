[This was caused by YARN-2943.  A new column was added at the beginning of the table but table indices in the sorting metadata for the javascript were not updated accordingly., Patch to bump the column indices to take into account the new node label column.  This also restores the formatting of the code where the columns are defined so it's easier to see the column order and count them.

[~leftnoteasy] or [~jianhe] please review.  It would be nice to get this into 2.7., Tried in a local cluster, HTTP address, #containers and node-label sorting all work. +1.

Pending Jenkins., Updated title and description, added node-label column to reflect changes in the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. It would be nice to get this into 2.7.
Seeing as how long 2.7.0 release has taken, I propose that we put this in 2.7.1. I'll start a discussion on the dev lists to immediately follow up 2.7.0 with a 2.7.1 within 2-3 weeks. That works?, Just committed to trunk/branch-2, [~jlowe], [~vinodkv], please let me know when you figure out whether we need put to 2.7.x., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7547 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7547/])
