, Thanks [~jutia] for the patch, does this apply to trunk too? If so you need to provide one for trunk and another one for branch-2 (or branch-2.9).
Can we add a unit test to reproduce this?, Can you also post the stack traces and describe how this can happen?, Thanks [~jutia], is it related to YARN-8193 ?, yes, it's related to YARN-8193.   this is an applicable patch for 2.9.0, bq. this is an applicable patch for 2.9.0

Tag the patch as for branch-2.9, something like YARN-8471-branch-2.9.000.patch for Yetus to know where to apply.
In any case, if this a problem, we should see how to apply this to trunk too.
We need a unit tests to trigger this in any case., Thanks inigo for reminding me this. and I will update patch name. {color:#333333}it's related to YARN-8193, but  2.9.0 has this issue too.{color}, [~jutia], if this is mostly same as YARN-8193, could u reopen YARN-8193 and attach patch to there? cc: [~elgoiri], sure. I reopened YARN-8193 and attached patch., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
