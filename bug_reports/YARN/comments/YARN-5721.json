[I'm working on it., In AMRMClientImpl.java line 668, remoteRequestsTable can be null. Critical change was introduced with commit 19c743c1bbcaf3df8f1d63e557143c960a538c42., GitHub user szape opened a pull request:

    YARN-5721. NPE at AMRMClientImpl.getMatchingRequests

    The following NPE was thrown using a Spark 2.1.0-SNAPSHOT (as client) by changing Hadoop dependency to the latest (by the time the ERROR has been generated).
    
    {{2016-10-10 11:33:53,392 ERROR yarn.ApplicationMaster: Uncaught exception:

    We've also pulled the latest code (1 hour ago) from the repository, and ran a test for getMatchingRequests. Same NPE has been encountered.
    
    getMatchingRequests should never throw an NPE even if it has been called right after the client has been started.
