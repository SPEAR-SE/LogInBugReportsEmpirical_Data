, Upgrading to Blocker since this should be fixed in the 0.23.6 respin.  Also, I'm unable to assign this to Liang, so I'll need someone with YARN project authority to allow Liang to be assigned YARN JIRAs., Thanks, Liang!  I committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23.

Tom, please merge this to branch-0.23.6 before building 0.23.6 rc1., Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #106 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/106/])
