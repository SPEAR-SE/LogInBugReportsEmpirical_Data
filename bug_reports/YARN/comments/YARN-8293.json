, YARN service can have duplicated application name between users.  If user name field is removed, this will cause confusion for administrator who is looking at all jobs from all users., Hi [~eyang]

We will be removing user.name only in secure cluster where its doesnt consider user.name. It always takes from the kinited user. Hence we hide this in secure cluster. In normal cluster, same will be available for the use case which u mentioned above, [~sunilg] The changes in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-ui/src/main/webapp/app/templates/components/deploy-service.hbs will hide username column from the displaying table.  Does this imply that the user interface can only display jobs for the login user, and not all the jobs from all users for yarn admin?  This seems to be a use ability limitation for yarn admin users.  We might need follow up JIRAs to make sure that we can support the case where yarn admin look at all the jobs from all users.  Other than this nitpick, I think this patch is ready., bq.Does this imply that the user interface can only display jobs for the login user, and not all the jobs from all users for yarn admin?

Yes. Only login user can see only his apps. But he is an admin, then all apps could be seen. This filtering is done in RM if a config param is turned on. Otherwise in a secure cluster, only same user apps can be seen.

We can an open another Jira to do an investigation which covers all secure/non-secure scenarios. I ll do that post this patch, thanks [~sunilg] for the patch. I tested the patch and looks fine to me. 
[~eyang] Would you be able to commit this patch today? , +1 looks good to me.  I committed this patch to trunk and branch-3.1.

Thank you [~sunilg] for the patch.
Thank you [~rohithsharma] for the review., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #14224 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/14224/])
