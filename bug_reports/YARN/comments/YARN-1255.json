[RM might be killed while it's saving the app data(after the app file is created, before the data is written into the file), when RM recovers it loads an empty file and gets a NULL exception, reproduced this locally and see the same exception stack., Is this a dup of YARN-1185?, Thanks [~jlowe] it is.]
