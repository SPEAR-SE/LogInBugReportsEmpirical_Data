[YARN-4091 tries to address this issue with a REST query result model to see what happened in certain node heartbeats for a queue/app/containers. Going to upload a patch there soon. This one will definitely help in adding more debug informations, also need to see excessive logging wont happen. A little trickier, but will be a very good effort if we bring up the same., [~sunilg], thanks for pointing me to those ongoing efforts. What I want to accomplish in this jira is to simply add more debug logging of what might go wrong when allocate container to queue. 
I have upload a patch which add more debug logging in regular container allocator to indicate problems of allocating containers., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Cancelling the patch as it no longer applies.  I agree that this is very closely related to YARN-4091 and may no longer be necessary with that now implemented.]
