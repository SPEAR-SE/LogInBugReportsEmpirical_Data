[Changing summary and description to state that both {{ApplicationCLI}} and {{NodeCLI}} have the problem., This patch switches to using {{line.separator}} both in the CLI classes that generate the output and the test classes that check expected output.  I've converted some of the logic from using {{StringBuffer#append}} to using {{PrintWriter#println}}, which is guaranteed to use {{line.separator}}.

With this patch, {{TestYarnCLI}} passes on both Mac and Windows.  I also built a distro and tested manually on both platforms.

This message is automatically generated., I'm uploading a new patch to address some feedback about clarity of this change.  I've added comments in {{ApplicationCLI}} and {{NodeCLI}} explaining that the reason we use {{PrintWriter#println}} is that it's guaranteed to use the correct platform line ending.  I also changed the test code to generate the expected strings using {{PrintWriter#println}} instead of {{StringUtils#join}}., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
