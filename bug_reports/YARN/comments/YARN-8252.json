[the problem is thatÂ {{ServiceMaster}} extends {{CompositeService}} ; which is in {{hadoop-common.jar}} - hence the class containing the main method could not be loaded...it's unfortunate that the jvm is unable to provide more information about the problem

I think it would be better to separate the main method to be in a separate class file.

And this brings me to the originial problem: because I've run into this... it seems "hadoop-common" is not on the classpath when ServiceMaster is starting up (invoked using api to bring up llap service), currently the only jar provided at startup is a vanilla {{yarn-service-core.jar}}; I think the idea was to provide a fat at launch time... (or add all dependencies)
I don't seem to be able to see a suiteable fat jar in the build...but I'm not that familiar with hadoop build; so there might be one :D, I'm seeing this when trying to install LLAP with hadoop master. The container doesn't start and the only error line is:
{{Error: Could not find or load main class org.apache.hadoop.yarn.service.ServiceMaster}}, [~jmarhuen]: I've found out that this is "normal" but very misleaing at first
you have to run {{yarn app -enableFastLaunch  <dir>}} to enable it prior to launching the service - I think it would be better to either do automatically on first launch ; or give a better explanation about what's going south...., the problem is caused by that the the transitive dependencies are missing; which are put there by "fastlaunch" - a better way of reporting the error would be better...]
