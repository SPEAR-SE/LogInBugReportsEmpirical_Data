[If this configuration {{yarn.log-aggregation.file-controller.TFile.class}} is not expected to be configurable by admin, it should be hardcoded and not be a config at all!, What branch are you running in?  I can't duplicate this error, and in both branch-2 and trunk, I see this line in TestYarnConfigurationFields.java:

    xmlPrefixToSkipCompare.add(
        "yarn.log-aggregation.file-controller.TFile.class");
, Thanks for the verification. Ray, 
This test will not fail in both trunk and branch-2.

So, I will close this jira as invalid, [~vinodkv]
bq.If this configuration yarn.log-aggregation.file-controller.TFile.class is not expected to be configurable by admin, it should be hardcoded and not be a config at all!

Now, I can remember why I am doing this at very beginning. Actually, I did this on purpose. First of all, to use new log aggregation file format, we need at least two configurations:
{code}
yarn.log-aggregation.file-formats
yarn.log-aggregation.file-controller.%s.class
{code}

To support backward compatibility, we always expect the user to append TFile to the configuration"yarn.log-aggregation.file-formats" which has already been documented. 
Of course, we could always hardcode "TFile" in code, but that means we will always support TFile which is OK. 
But to make this configurable, then the users can disable TFile support if they want.]
