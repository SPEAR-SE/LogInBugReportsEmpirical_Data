[never register org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.security.ClientToAMTokenSecretManagerInRM.masterKeys while SecretKey is null., Hi [~mujunchao], thanks for reporting and working on this issue.
It is a nice catch. I see why this is a critical issue. For non-secure cluster, the more completed jobs, the more entries with null value will be left in {{ClientToAMTokenSecretManagerInRM#masterKeys}}. You patch makes sense to me, since we only call {{unRegisterApplication}} in secure mode, we should also call {{registerApplication}} in secure mode to match {{unRegisterApplication}}.
Could you add a test case in your patch? You can do something similar as {{TestRMAppAttemptTransitions#testGetClientToken}} for non-secure mode., Thanks [~mujunchao] for reporting and working in this. I am assigning this issue to you.

Adding to [~zxu], Can you also take care of the naming convention for the patch like <JIRA-ID>-<patch-version>.patch?
, Nice Catch!!, Thanks for your reviewing, I will give the test case., Ok, got, thanks Devaraj for reviewing., add test case., thanks for the updated patch [~mujunchao]!
The patch looks most good to me, some nits:
# Add {{@VisibleForTesting}} before function {{hasMasterKey}} to mark this function used for test only. So you can remove the comment {{// Only for test}}
# It looks like the code in {{testNoSecureNoRegistClientToken}} are similar as {{testRegistClientTokenInSecure}}. Can we merge {{testNoSecureNoRegistClientToken}} with {{testRegistClientTokenInSecure}} to one test? We can rename the test as {{testApplicationAttemptMasterKey}}. You can check {{isMasterKeyExisted}} based on {{isSecurityEnabled}}. You can change your comments {{can not get ClientToken}}/{{can get ClientToken}} to {{can not get MasterKey}}/{{can get MasterKey}}, update test case, thanks for xuzhihai's reviewing., thanks for your reviewing, have updated the test case, thanks!, thanks for your reviewing, have updated the test case, thanks!, thanks for updating the patch quickly.
The new patch looks good in general. It'd be nice to address a few small nits, mostly regarding the comment and style.
# Change {{// this is to test master key is saved in the state store}} to {{// this is to test master key is saved in the secret manager}}
# Remove comment {{//assumeTrue(!isSecurityEnabled);}}
# Change {{if(isSecurityEnabled)}} to {{if (isSecurityEnabled)}}
# Could you fix the indentation? It should be indented by 2(new paragraph) or 4 bytes.
+1 non-binding once these are addressed. Thanks again for working on this., Thanks [~mujunchao] for updated patch with test. 

Please take care of these comments also along with the [~zxu] comments fix.

1.I don't think adding this new method is required. Can we just use the ClientToAMTokenSecretManagerInRM#getMasterKey() to know whether the master key present or not?
{code:xml}
+  
+  @VisibleForTesting
+  public synchronized boolean hasMasterKey(
+	  ApplicationAttemptId applicationAttemptID) {
+	return this.masterKeys.containsKey(applicationAttemptID);
+  }
{code}

2. I see there are some format issues in the patch w.r.t braces and indentation with spaces. Please go through the 'Making Changes' section in https://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute and configure your IDE according. It will be one time job and you don't have to worry next time for creating patches.

{code:xml}
+    if(isSecurityEnabled)
+    {
{code}
{code:xml}
+    }
+    else
+    {
{code}

4. Remove unused imports in RMAppAttemptImpl.java., \\

This message was automatically generated., Cancelling patch to address the above comments., fix the comments and format the code., thanks for your reviewing, have fixed the comments and the indentation., Thanks Devar for reviewing,
1. I think ClientToAMTokenSecretManagerInRM#hasMasterKey() is necessary, in this case the value is null, so i new function to recognize it.
2. have fixed.
3. As i use annotation @VisibleForTesting,in my ide, need to import com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting., \\
