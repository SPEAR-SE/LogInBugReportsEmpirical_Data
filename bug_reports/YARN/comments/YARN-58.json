[In particular, {{DFSClient}} maintains a socket cache.  Closed sockets are not detected until another connection is needed, or the client is closed.  That's another issue, but the NM's failure to close filesystems for a user after the app completes causes a leak of sockets in the CLOSE_WAIT state that eventually exhaust fds for the process.

Calling {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI}}, as the JT does, is troublesome that it may close the fs for other apps running as that user.  One approach is to partition the fs cache to allow each app to maintain its own cache of filesystems.  See HADOOP-8490 for possible approaches, which would allow the closing of the app's filesystems ala the JT.

Also note that failure to close filesystems causes all future jobs to use the configuration of the first job.  This will be very problematic, so it's imperative to ensure apps each get their own cached instances., This looks like a problem of the newly added socket cache.  Once it is fixed (say, it is removed for the sake of discussion), are there other problems?, See comment on HADOOP-8490: I think the NM should just be side-stepping the FS cache, so it can explicitly close the FS when necessary., {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI}} is actually a reasonable approach.  Each request is creating a new ugi so there's no issue with "pulling the rug out" from underneath other fs users., Patch ensures {{closeAllForUGI}} is called in the event of a service init failure, or when the aggregation thread is done., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., This patch seems like it partially addresses the problem. Something else still seems to be leaking sockets. , Thanks to [~jlowe] for pointing out a simple way for me to check the  socket leak.

{code}, Daryn and I did some more digging.  It looks like the resource localization being performed by the ContainerLocalizer is also leaking filesystems., Yes, I should have commented on the title change.  Log aggregation is leaking, which I fixed in this patch, but something else is also leaking.  I suspected localization, and Jason Lowe and I tracked it down so I'll fix it in this patch too., Updated patch to trunk and closed filesystems in ContainerLocalizer which fixes the other filesystem leak., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I think the additional {{closeAllForUGI}} needs to be added like this to guard against exceptions in the other cleanup operations causing the fs close to be skipped.

You probably want to break out the {{closeAllForUGI}} into {{closeFileSystems}} ala the aggregator part of the patch so mocking a test will be easier., Updated patch per review comments., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
