[Hi [~rohithsharma] & [~sunilg], Agree that it was getting redirected to Active RM in the Old webui, but was wondering it was good to have it in the same way in new webui too, as whenever there is RM failover we will not be able to access the logs , JMX metrics etc from the webui of the standby and not all might have access to the hadoop cluster to see the standby admin logs. 
Thoughts ?

UI2 is based on js framework (ember). We download statics (such as images, js files, icons) from the server which is hosting (Currently both RM has this). Once we have statics, page will be rendered and then server invocation will done to fetch data (This will be done only from ACTIVE RM). Hence after switching, basic static may b served from standby RM, however data is fetched only from Active RM. In contrast to old UI where it is a server side impl, new UI is end to end client side. So it helps to overcome this redirects etc.]
