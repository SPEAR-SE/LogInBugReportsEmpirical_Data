[This is strongly related to, if not a duplicate of, MAPREDUCE-5502 and/or YARN-2261.  The problem is that YARN provides no ability for an application to perform cleanup processing outside of what the ApplicationMaster can perform.  The MapReduce framework relies on the AM to move the .jhist file to the intermediate directory for the JHS to pick up for the job's history.  If the application is killed before the AM runs or the last app attempt crashes or is otherwise incapacitated (e.g. expires from the RM's point of view) then there will be no history for the job on the JHS.
, When the link is clicked , it is directed to simply the applications list of cluster. So the link can be renamed something in accordance. As the link is named "History" but , it's not redirected to JHS., If this is just about the naming of the link when the application failed to provide a tracking URL then that's a more straightforward fix, although currently the RM is not tracking the state of whether an application updated the URL currently.]
