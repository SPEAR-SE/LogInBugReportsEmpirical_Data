This message was automatically generated., Looks good.  Two minor things:
- Can you look into the test failure to see if it's related
- Instead of the {{// Exposed for testing}} comment, you can put {{@VisibleForTesting}}
, +1 after doing those., The test failure looks unrelated. , Addressed feedback, Try triggering jenkins again, Re-uploading the same patch to see if Jenkins kicks in. 

By the way, I ran the test locally and it passes. +1, even if Jenkins doesn't kick in. , \\
