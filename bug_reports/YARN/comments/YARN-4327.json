[yarn.timeline-service.http-authentication.type  simple,  ATS will use  PseudoAuthenticationHandler, and generate a token like u=null&t=null. This make ATS causes java.lang.IllegalArgumentException., Did you try using yarn.timeline-service.http-authentication.type=kerberos?

So jobs could be submitted, but users can not access application history from webapp., I met the same issue, how about the status?
I try to set up Tez UI, if I use simple, I can open the Web UI for timeline server,
but I cannot submit job.
If use kerberos, job can be submit, but timeline server web UI cannot be open., I am encountering the same issue. When I use yarn.timeline-service.http-authentication.type= Kerberos, I am able to execute the job with execution engine Tez. But I can't see the Tez view. 
If I change yarn.timeline-service.http-authentication.type=simple, then I can see Tez, but can't execute the job.]
