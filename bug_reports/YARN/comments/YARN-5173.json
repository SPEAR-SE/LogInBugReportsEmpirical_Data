[Since Timeline Server and AHS are in the same process and the secretManager for AHS is of the type {{TimelineDelegationTokenSecretManager}}, should the token from timeline be reused by AHSClient instead of a new token of the same type? Can we authenticate AHS port with the Timeline token? Requesting [~zjshen], [~jianhe] for some comments and insight. Thanks a lot!]
