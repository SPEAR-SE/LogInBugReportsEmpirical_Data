[Can you please provide below information to help debug the issue?
* RM / NM / AM logs (please enable debug).
* yarn-site.xml and mapred-site.xml files used.
* Which scheduler you are using?
, [~nishan] How many number of map / reduce tasks were there? was slow start configured?, [~ojoshi] I am using capacity sheduler

number of maps:3
number of reduces:1

Slow start configured to 1
, [~nishan] can you try YARN-957 patch locally and see if it fixes your problem?, This sounds like a wrong configuration problem. If you have only one node, and appmaster occupied some memory resource of NM, then you don't have enough resource to run map or reduce task container. Will close it as not a problem.]
