[Hi [~rchiang], I wrote the code for that test. My apologies for not handling the dependency.

The test is meant to ensure that a random user cannot kill another user's app via web services. When the RM receives a request to kill an app, it checks if the user who sent the request either submitted the app or has administrator privileges on the queue in which the app was submitted.

The FifoScheduler give administrator privileges to all users as a result we can't use it for this test. CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler allow queue specific administrators.The test sets up a queue with an administrator, submits an app to that queue, attempts to kill that app as a different user and then checks that the request was denied.

In order to add support for FairScheduler, all you have to do is setup a FairScheduler conf which sets up the queue with a specific administator and reload the rm scheduler with that config. I can make the change myself if you wish, but I'm not too familiar with FairScheduler and how to setup queues in it. I've also uploaded a patch that skips the test if the scheduler is not CapacityScheduler. In the future, once we add support for FairScheduler to it to run with FairScheduler as well.

If you'd like me to add support for FairScheduler, please re-assign the bug to me., Uploaded new patch with formatting fixed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., [~vvasudev], since you already uploaded a patch, I've reassigned the JIRA to you.  I'll test out the patch for the yarn.acl.enable property change as well--it wasn't clear from the earlier message whether the patch will fix that issue., [~vvasudev].  Thanks, I see how your change works.  Should the same thing be done for yarn.acl.enable or is there a better way to do modify the test to work correctly for both possible values?, Uploaded new patch which should take care both issues., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Test failure is unrelated to the patch., Okay, I've run the test locally and made sure that it works for the two property changes mentioned earlier.

[~vvasudev]  Many thanks for the quick fixes!

, Based on feedback from [~zjshen] - updated patch with isAuthorizationEnabled renamed to is isAuthenticationEnabled to reflect the right use.

, +1 for the fix. Will commit it late tomorrow given [~rchiang] wants to investigate more., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
