[Having looked into YARN-1922 recently, I wouldn't have expected to see processes staying around after containers were killed by Yarn.  What OS are you using?  Does the "setsid" command exist?  I think Yarn only kills the entire process group if setsid is available., setsid exists and OS is Ubuntu, Also, there seem to be two problems.

{code}
this.yarnClient.killApplication(appId);
{code}

while it doesn't throw an exception you do see the following in the logs
{code}
13:10:22,017 ERROR IPC Server handler 48 on 8035 resourcemanager.ApplicationMasterService:328 - Application doesn't exist in cache appattempt_1397581697363_0002_000001
{code}]
