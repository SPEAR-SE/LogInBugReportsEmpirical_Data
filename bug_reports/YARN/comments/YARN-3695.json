[[~djp], we have seen in some cases EOFException is thrown when connection loses. see YARN-2841, [~rohithsharma] [~djp] [~devraj.jaiman] Seems I forgot to fix retry policy FOREVER in ServerProxy as part of [YARN-3646|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3646]

ServerProxy.java
{code}
    if (maxWaitTime == -1) {
      // wait forever.
      return RetryPolicies.RETRY_FOREVER;
    }

   ...

    Map<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy> exceptionToPolicyMap =
        new HashMap<Class<? extends Exception>, RetryPolicy>();
    exceptionToPolicyMap.put(EOFException.class, retryPolicy);
    exceptionToPolicyMap.put(ConnectException.class, retryPolicy);
    ...
{code}, bq. Junping Du, we have seen in some cases EOFException is thrown when connection loses. see YARN-2841
I see. Thanks [~jianhe] for sharing the background here. Now I agree EOFException shouldn't be a problem for retry. 

bq. Seems I forgot to fix retry policy FOREVER in ServerProxy as part of YARN-3646.
No problem. We can fix the same issue in this JIRA given EOFException deserve a retry also. I will update JIRA name to reflect this. Please feel free to take this JIRA if you want to work on it. Thx!, \\

This message was automatically generated., looks good, +1, [~jianhe] Thanks for the review.

Moved the Precondtion Checks before creating RetryPolicy. So that we can avoid creating policy if the connection timeout values are invalid., \\
