[It's the race condition problem, but is restricted with the test.

It happens when
{code}
    Assert.assertEquals("Completed container is not removed", 0,
        asyncClient.containers.size());
{code}
executes before all ContainerEventProcessors completes and containers are removed.

After the following step:
{code}
    while (!((TestCallbackHandler1) asyncClient.callbackHandler)
        .isStopFailureCallsExecuted()) {
      Thread.sleep(10);
    }
{code}
all the callback functions are executed, but the remaining operations in ContainerEventProcessors#run may still not be executed., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
