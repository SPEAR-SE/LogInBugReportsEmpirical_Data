[Here's a link showing usage in Spark.

https://community.hortonworks.com/articles/28070/starting-spark-jobs-directly-via-yarn-rest-api.html, Is the issue that the APIs are mislabeled or that Spark is using an alpha API?, I'd say the APIs are stable enough that they shouldn't be labelled alpha.  Searching on this API reveals lots of links
from 2015 to now and some libraries/ports so it isn't really screaming bleeding edge anymore.
