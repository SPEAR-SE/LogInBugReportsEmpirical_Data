[Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for filing a JIRA to address this issue. I think we may have to add a new field instead of change directly on existing field or we will have incompatible issues., Since 3.0.0 is not too far out, I would like for us to update on trunk. /cc [~andrew.wang]
, [~kasha], actually we can do this in compatible way like what [~djp] suggested: add two int64 fields, deprecate int32 fields. User can set/get both fields, but int64 fields will be preferred.

I would suggest to keep compatibility even we ship 3.0.0, all YARN applications use the Resource object frequently, it gonna be hard to ask everyone update lots of source code to use 3.0.0., Sure, all client-facing updates need to be compatible. If we are doing it only in trunk, we could at least do the updates between NM-RM incompatibly. , can we change the existing int field to long, instead of adding a new field ? 
Setter API is fine as long can accept int.  Need a new getter API to return the long type., Hi folks, looks like there are still some more subtasks here. Do we think we can get them done for alpha2?, Judging by the amount of effort that went into YARN-4844, I'm concerned that the remaining sub-JIRAs might not make it into alpha-2.  Any updates, [~wangda]?, This JIRA is more like a reminder, from my side, I didn't see MUST-to-fix issues so far. So downgrading to major to unblock next 3.x release., I'm also going to remove the "Incompatible" flag since we're trying to preserve wire compatibility between Hadoop 2 and Hadoop 3, and it seems like there are proposals to implement the other APIs compatibly.]
