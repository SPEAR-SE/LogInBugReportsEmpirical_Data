[Hi [~haibochen]. Can you point me to the docker image you were using so that I can reproduce the failure? Thanks, I followed the instruction in BUILDING.txt on my Mac, that is,
    $ docker-machine create --driver virtualbox \
                            --virtualbox-memory "4096" hadoopdev
    $ eval $(docker-machine env hadoopdev)
    $ ./start-build-env.sh
    
Inside the docker instance, I then ran
    $ mvn package -Pnative -DskipTests -DskipShade
    $ mvn test -Pnative -Dtest=allNative, The issue is that {{/usr/bin/touch}} is a symlink to {{/bin/touch}} on Ubuntu. I thought I checked for this when I put up the initial patch, but I guess that I didn't. Uploading a patch that replaces {{/usr/bin/touch}} with {{/usr/bin/cut}}. I tested this patch and it works on rhel7 and ubuntu xenial. , Different distros seem to link /usr/bin to /bin or vis-versa.  Maybe it is safer to choose a file out side of /usr/bin or /bin?  How about /etc/profile?, /etc/profile would work fine, but the reason I didn't use it is because I replaced the usage of /usr with /etc. To preserve all of the tests that were already in place, we need to have multiple directories that have well-known files and aren't symlinked. The /usr/bin/cut test is to make sure that you can get to /usr/bin/cut even when you can't get to /usr or /usr/bin. If we were to use /etc/profile then it wouldn't test this since the tests already use /etc as a permitted mount., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
