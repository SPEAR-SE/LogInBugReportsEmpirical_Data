[Hi [~xgong], I am taking this over and will submit a patch soon. Thanks, I think this is the same issue as YARN-6515, Sorry for the delay from my side for the docker related configuration issue. Will discuss and resolve it asap., hi [~Naganarasimha]

Are you suggesting to close this one as a dup of YARN-6515?, [~cheersyang], 
Yes, YARN-6515 was almost done except for that hard coded cgroup mount configuration. Will try to upload the patch excluding that so that it can b handled in a different jira, Sure, thanks for the confirmation [~Naganarasimha]. I will close this one as dup.]
