This message was automatically generated., HI [~lavkesh]
Thanks for working on this patch.
In initExceptionWithConstructor, I feel  *IllegalArgumentException* also has to be thrown. Its missing now., [~sunilg] : Uh.. IllegalArgumentException is not a checked Exception. It is not needed to be declared thrown., Yes. Missed it :) Thanks!, [~lavkesh], thanks for working on this issue. This looks like a good catch.
One question about the patch, why retrying on SecurityException? Will retrying on NoSuchMethodException be enough?
If need retrying on SecurityException, Can we add a test case against it?
There is a typo in the comment {{This does not has constructor with String argument}}, should be {{have}} instead of {{has}}.
Also could we make the comment {{Try with String constructor if it fails try with default.}} clearer as
{{Try constructor with String argument, if it fails, try default.}}
Can we add some comment to explain why ClassNotFoundException is expected in the test?
, Sorry, there's one more thing I forgot to mention, Can we rename {{initExceptionWithConstructor}} to instantiateExceptionImpl?, Uh. Yes you are right cls.getConstructor() throws SecurityException, but we don't need to declared it to be thrown.
We need to only capture NoSuchMethodException., sorry, typo: we don't need to declare it to be thrown. , deSerialize() method throws class ClassNotFoundException which is wrapped in YarnRuntimeException if there would be some class loading issues. (Other tests also has it)
No other exception should be thrown for the test to be passed., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~zxu] Sorry my bad. It *must* throw ClassNotFoundException because there was no call to pb.init(cause); , Hi [~lavkesh], thanks for updating the patch. The patch mostly looks good. Some nits:
#Can we remove the following code from testDeserializeWithDefaultConstructor? these are duplicate test as {{testDeserialize}}, So we can save a little bit time to run test.
{code}
    try {
      pb.deSerialize();
      Assert.fail("deSerialze should throw YarnRuntimeException");
    } catch (YarnRuntimeException e) {
      Assert
          .assertEquals(ClassNotFoundException.class, e.getCause().getClass());
    }
{code}
#The typo in the comment is still not fixed: change {{has}} to {{have}}
