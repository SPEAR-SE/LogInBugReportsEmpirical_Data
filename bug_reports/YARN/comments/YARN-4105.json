This message was automatically generated., Patch LGTM too, thanks [~lichangleo]. Only one nit: could you update test comment to be:
bq. // app 1 ask for 10GB memory and 1 vcore,
To
bq. // allocates 10GB memory and 1 vcore to app 1.

Same to app2., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for review! Updated the test comment, \\
