[+1 to first jump to application-page. Ran into this occasionally before., I understand always linking to the per app page to try to make it more consistent but at the same time I don't like that power users will have to click one more time.  I also don't see how this solves the issue with the tracking url being a bad link, unless you are also proposing to handle that better on the app page?  if an app finishes and doesn't set the history link (for instance a non-mapreduce app) or crashes before they can set it, the tracking url link is still going to to go a bad page., bq.

Yeah, but it's a trade off for consistency. I've seen people struggling when failures happen and that is a bigger pain than clicking through one more link.

We should do a better job fixing such bad links, so yeah +1 for YARN-1106 and the likes. But even without that, this is still fine. Without my proposed change, users will hit bad links and then have no clue of what happened. With the change, they'll land up on the app-page, learn *something* about their apps, and then click the bad link. Net-net, they get more info than they do now.
