This message is automatically generated., Findbugs is false positive.  {{Timer}} class is thread-safe, but it's instantiated and cancelled in sync'ed methods so findbugs is assuming that scheduling tasks should be sync'ed too.

Test failure appears unrelated, but looking into it. , Update findbugs exclusions for false positive on a thread-safe Timer.  {{TestRMWebServices}} still fails even when I revert this patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
