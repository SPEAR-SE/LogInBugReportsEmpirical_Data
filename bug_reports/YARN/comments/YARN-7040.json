[Looks like a race condition in the test. The test sets a timer with an interval of 1000ms and sleeps for 1500ms assuming that the timer will fire during that time period. If the timer thread runs slowly then the node label won't get updated by the time that it is checked in the test. The timer thread needs to run pretty slowly (500 ms slower than the test code thread), but I've seen it happen twice now.]
