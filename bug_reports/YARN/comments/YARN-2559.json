, This is still not fixed for unmanaged AppMasters.

, Hi [~cristib],
Can you please share the NPE stack trace ? We just fixed in YARN-4452 and YARN-4623 recently in trunk, 2.7.3 and 2.6.4. May be is it the same issue you are facing ?

, Yes, saw it after a bit of digging. Correct, is supposed to be fixed by YARN 4452 -- though the title is a bit vague (NPE when submitting unmanaged Application). I cannot confirm the fix since the Hadoop version I am working on is 2.7.0. The workaround I have in mind to overcome this issue in older versions is to just disable the GHS property, yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled=false. Any other ideas how to do it w/o affecting the whole system, i.e. something more specific to an AppMaster?

Will confirm the fix on my next upgrade to 2.8.0.

I've added related links to those 2 guys here as well.

Thanks!, when submitting Unmanaged Application Masters instead]
