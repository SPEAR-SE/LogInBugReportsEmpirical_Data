I didn't go deep into this commit, but I think there must be reason for above change. 
So the easiest fix is a trival change in TestClientRMService.testTokenRenewalWrongUser., Thank you for taking this JIRA, [~zhiguohong]. This problem has been already reported on YARN-2018, and the patch is also available. Can you close this ticket as duplicated? Thanks., Thanks for reporting this [~zhiguohong]. I committed the fix for YARN-2018.]
