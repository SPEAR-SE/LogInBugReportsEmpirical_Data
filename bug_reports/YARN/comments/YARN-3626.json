, As I understand, the current patch doesn't do what you intend. The new configuration added is supposed to be per app, but it is now a server side configuration. Unless the app and server share configurations, this should not work.

Reopening this. I think we should revert it (/cc [~xgong]) and continue discussion/work to do it the right away.

We may have to depend on some sort of a named environment variable or something, assuming adding a new field in CLC is not desirable., In that case, here's a patch which goes back to the original approach used during troubleshooting, which uses the classpath itself to communicate the difference (it only touches other code to revert parts of the earlier patch no longer needed, the actual change, when done this way, is solely in ContainerLaunch.java, and it makes the conditional determination based on the classpath differences already present due to the manipulation earlier in the chain, in this case, by mapreduce due to user.classpath.first), [~cnauroth], [~vvasudev] - This patch goes back to the original approach I passed by you offline - the fix itself is the same, but it uses the classpath instead of configuration to determine when the behavior should change.  Your thoughts?, \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. We may have to depend on some sort of a named environment variable or something, assuming adding a new field in CLC is not desirable.
Can't we do the above? We definitely cannot insert mapreduce incantations like job.jar into YARN., I don't fully understand the objection to the former patch that had been committed.

bq. The new configuration added is supposed to be per app, but it is now a server side configuration.

There was a new YARN configuration property for triggering this behavior, but the MR application would toggle on that YARN property only if the MR job submission had {{MAPREDUCE_JOB_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST}} on.  From {{MRApps}}:

{code}
    boolean userClassesTakesPrecedence = 
      conf.getBoolean(MRJobConfig.MAPREDUCE_JOB_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST, false);

    if (userClassesTakesPrecedence) {
      conf.set(YarnConfiguration.YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE,
        "true");
    }
{code}

I thought this implemented "per app" behavior, because it could vary between MR app submission instances.  It would not be a requirement to put {{YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE}} into the server configs and have the client and server share configs.

Is there a detail I'm missing?, bq. Can't we do the above? We definitely cannot insert mapreduce incantations like job.jar into YARN.

That's why I took the config based approach, which apparently is invalid... but it also worked, which is quite confusing.  I'm going to go back and validate our reasoning for believing it shoudn't.

bq. Can't we do the above? We definitely cannot insert mapreduce incantations like job.jar into YARN.

I suppose we can if it would work.  It needs to be something which can be propagated from Oozie, which adds additional complexity.  Ideally, we need something the MrApps can set based on the presence of the mapred configuration so that it propagates through.  Do we have an example of this being done elsewhere?, Right, going back to [~cnauroth], [~vinodkv], we chatted and you asserted that the original approach can't work, but it seemed to, it's not entirely clear to me why it shouldn't..., bq. I thought this implemented "per app" behavior, because it could vary between MR app submission instances. It would not be a requirement to put YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE into the server configs and have the client and server share configs.
YARN doesn't have a notion of app-configs, it doesn't know app's config files etc. So, the app cannot set a config property that it expects the server to respect.

No idea, how your original patch apparently worked. May be we are missing something.

[~cwelch], what I was proposing was something in the lines of (a) user sets MR user-classpath-before config (b) MR converts that into a special env for YARN and (c) YARN looks at the ENV to figure out how to the order the classpath.

Overall, it is terrible that we are talking classpaths in YARN, but that's for another JIRA., I see now.  Thanks for the clarification.  In that case, I agree with the new proposal., Now using the environment to pass the configuration., \\

This message was automatically generated., Checkstyle looks insignificant.

[~cnauroth], [~vinodkv], I've changed the approach to use the environment instead of configuration as suggested, can one of you review pls?, Hi Craig.  This looks good to me.  I have just one minor nitpick.  I think the logic in {{ContainerLaunch}} for setting {{preferLocalizedJars}} could be simplified to this:

{code}
boolean preferLocalizedJars = Boolean.valueOf(classpathPrependDistCache);
{code}

{{Boolean#valueOf}} is null-safe.

Thanks!, Let's mark the new env CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE as @Private and add a note also in the code saying so - I don't see any use beyond what we are doing. That and I think we should clean up this entire mess via YARN-3685. Okay?, [~vinodkv] indicated it's private & Windows specific, all for doing something better overall long term aka [YARN-3685]

[~cnauroth] switched to simpler valueOf, Thanks, Craig!  We could potentially stick the {{@Private}} annotation directly onto {{ApplicationConstants#CLASSPATH_PREPEND_DISTCACHE}}.  I'll let Vinod chime in on whether or not this was the intent of his feedback.

+1 from me, pending Jenkins run., Sure, annotated also, \\
