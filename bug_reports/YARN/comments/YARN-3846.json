[[~mohdshahidkhan],
Could you try https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2238 to see if this problem is already resolved?, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2238 is for different fix.
The label "Queue  :" was added before the queue name in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3362. After the search was not working and the same has been handled in the  https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3707.
The fix is OK for the for the first child of the queue 
but will not work for the second child
for example Queue: b.x
       
  Queue: root
    Queue: a          _*For queue a it will work fine*_
    Queue: b    
       Queue: b.x   _*But for queue x and y this will not work*_
       Queue: b.y

*My question: *
  What is the significance of adding Label *"Queue:"*  before the queue name?
 

, Please confirm whether we have to keep the Label "Queue: " or not.
Then will submit the patch accordingly.
, Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.1 into 2.7.2., [~mohdshahidkhan],
I tried to reproduce this in 2.7, it should work.

I created a queue root.b.b1, and submits job to that queue, the filter works.

And the code in 2.7 doesn't contain change of "Queue:" before queue's name. Could you use branch-2.7 to see if the problem still exists., you are right 2.7 is not having the issue. 
My mistake i have raised in the wrong branch.
Affected version should be changed.

The issue is there in trunk.
The trunk is having the "Queue: " change. This change only has induced the filter issue and even you only  have handled https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3707.
But if we have to keep the lbel "Queue:  " the current issue should be fixed in the trunk.
, also  in  branch-2 , have changed the affected and target version., Please review attached patch, Not adding any test case
Change is only js code., \\
