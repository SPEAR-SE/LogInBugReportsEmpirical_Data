{code}, Patch to include capacity-scheduler.xml in hadoop-yarn-server-tests-${version}-tests.jar

Also changes the dist packaging to move this file under 'share/hadoop/yarn/test' instead of 'share/hadoop/yarn'.

Is there a standard location for test-jars - instead of share/hadoop/yarn/test ?, This might have been caused by YARN-140, investigating further., Tested the patch locally with help from [~tedyu@apache.org].

Ran TestTableMapReduce and TestHFileOutputFormat against hadoop-trunk with and without the updated patch. The tests did fail in both runs, but the error was not related to the capacity-scheduler after applying the patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
