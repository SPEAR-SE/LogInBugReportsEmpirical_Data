[Hi [~jianhe]
This will be a potential one w.r.t ZK especially for RMApp and RMAppAttemt. If an error is not notified and RM is not fail-fast, there are chances that RMApp will be NEW_SAVING. So is it ok to fire a failure event directly to RMApp and RMAppAttempt if any of its Store/Update/Remove events are failed due to store exception. Such a direct error handling can mark app and appattempts into error state rather than keeping in limbo state. I would like to try this if its fine. Pls share your thoughts.]
