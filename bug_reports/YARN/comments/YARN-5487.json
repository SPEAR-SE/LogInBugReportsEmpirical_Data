When I tried to reproduce with Hadoop 2.7.2 and trunk, NodeManager can be shutdown correctly with ctrl-c.
How can you reproduce this?

{code}
16/08/11 03:09:13 INFO nodemanager.NodeManager: SHUTDOWN_MSG:
/************************************************************
SHUTDOWN_MSG: Shutting down NodeManager at bf488e9a0726/172.18.0.7
************************************************************/

, I didn't test this, but I wonder if the difference is if the RM is up or down.  Mine was down., Closing this in favor of YARN-5570.]
