This message is automatically generated., Test failure is unrelated., Thanks for following up on this.  Could you also change it to not show the button if you aren't an admin?  I don't want to confuse users by having a button there that doesn't do anything.

One other thing is could you add some css or something to make it look more like a button.  Right now it just looks like text and I didn't know it was clickable at first.   The placement of it seems a bit weird to me also but as along as its only showing up for admins that is less of an issue.

I haven't looked at the patch if details but I see we are creating a new AdminACLsManager each time. It would be nice if we didn't have to do that., Uploaded a new patch to address Thomas's comments.

bq. Could you also change it to not show the button if you aren't an admin?

Fixed.

I've added some style elements to make it look better.

This message is automatically generated., HI [~vvasudev]

I have couple of comments on same..

1. 
{code}
+      if (callerUGI != null && adminACLsManager.isAdmin(callerUGI)) {
+        isAdmin = true;
+      }
{code}
If adminACLsManager.areACLsEnabled() is false, do we need above check?

2. a minor nit
{code}.append(" b = confirm(\"Are you sure you wish to generate"{code}
Can be changed as "Are you sure to generate"

, This should go into 2.8.0 given YARN-3294 did., bq. If adminACLsManager.areACLsEnabled() is false, do we need above check?

Fixed.

bq. Can be changed as "Are you sure to generate"

+          && !adminACLsManager.areACLsEnabled()) {
+        isAdmin = true;

We don't need the isSecurityEnabled check,  just keep the one for areAclsEnabled. This could be combined with the previous if, make this the else if part but that isn't a big deal.

in QueuesBlock we are creating the AdminACLsManager every web page load.   Perhaps a better way would be to use the this.rm.getApplicationACLsManager() and extend the ApplicationAclsManager to explose an isAdmin functionality, {quote}

This message was automatically generated., I think below callerUGI can never never null

    if (UserGroupInformation.isSecurityEnabled() && callerUGI == null) {
      String msg = "Unable to obtain user name, user not authenticated";

    }
{code}
{code}
 if (callerUGI != null && aclsManager.isAdmin(callerUGI)) {
{code}, It can be null if no authentication filter is setup. Also, the aclsManager doesn't handle a null callerUGI and ends up throwing a null pointer exception., [~tgraves] - if possible, can you please review the latest patch?, in RMWebServices.java we don't need the isSecurityEnabled check.  Just remove the entire check.  My reasoning is that logLevel app does not do those checks, it simply makes sure you are an admin.

in the test TestRMWebServices.java.  We aren't actually asserting anything.  we should assert that the expected files exist.  Personally I would also like to see an assert that the expected exception occurred., \\
