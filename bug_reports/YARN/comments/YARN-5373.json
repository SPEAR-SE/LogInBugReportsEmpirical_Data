[It looks like the issue only appears when running with a secure cluster., As per offline discussion with Daniel, the cause is that in a secure cluster, the node manager that executes container launch code runs as a user that has no permission to read/execute the local wildcard directory that is downloaded as a resource by the remote user. Thus, directory.listFiles() return null., Created a separate jira to fix this issue for Windows, as I don't have an access to a window OS., I have a fix working that uses a {{PrivilegedOperation}} instead of modifying the script.  [~haibochen], you can close the Windows JIRA.  After I get it cleaned up a little, I'll post it for review., Here's a patch that fixes the issue.  I'd especially like someone to look closely at my C code.  It's been a decade since I last wrote any serious C., This issue is worse than I first thought.  It appears in any secure mode cluster, not just in secure (Kerberized) clusters.  I missed it initially because I was naively running as my cluster as root.  There are work-arounds, e.g. set the property to disable MAPREDUCE-6719., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The compile warning is intentional.  It's the test code testing a bad case.

The unit test failure appears unrelated., Thanks for picking this up, [~templedf].

Quick high-level question. After chowning to the user who would run the container, can we setfacl to give access to user "yarn" as well? 

Comments on the patch itself:
# container-executor.c
## The log messages for failure to open/read directory are missing the word NOT? 
## After readdir, I see the patch resets errno. What happens if the first call to readdir fails? Don't we lose the errno and fail to log and return -1? May be reset before the readdir call? Skip resetting altogether? 
## For the (dir == NULL), can we invert the operands to (NULL == dir)? 
# test-container-executor.c - typo: s/existant/existent

On the tests, do we need tests with {{linux-container-executor.nonsecure-mode.limit-users}} turned on/off? , NIO.2 has some spotty support for setting facls, but it's not supported on ext4, and maybe not ext3 either.  In order to implement an facl, we'll have to punch out to native code.  The code would land in the {{RawLocalFileSystem}} in common via JNI.  I can see where setting the facl is a cleaner solution at a high level, but JNI is icky by definition.  In the LCE we already have a mechanism defined to punch out to native code without the risk of JNI, so I can't say that the facl solution is clearly better.  Thoughts, [~sjlee0]?, Here's a patch addressing [~kasha]'s other comments., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, CC warning is still the same bogus complaint., I agree. I think the current approach is pretty consistent with other operations in LCE. I think there is value in keeping it consistent., The latest patch looks good. +1. Checking this in. , Thanks Daniel for fixing this, and Sangjin for your input.
