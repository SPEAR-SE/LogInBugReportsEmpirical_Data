[Hi [~yeshavora] ,

YARN gets the minimum between the global and the local limit. Your global limit is set to 100 (yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts) while the AM limit is set to 20.

Closing this Jira as invalid.
Diagnostics : Application application_1532481557746_0001 failed 20 times (global limit =100; local limit is =20), Actually, this is Yarn Service specific property. So the value 20 is getting set because that's the default for Yarn Services. The reason 100 was not taking effect is - for Yarn Service the property name is yarn.service.am-restart.max-attempts and not yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-attempts.

Once the right property is set, the desired behavior will be seen.

It is still an Invalid jira though.]
