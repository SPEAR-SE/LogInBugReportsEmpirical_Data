[Essentially, APPLICATION_INIT should only be sent to Auxiliary services specified by the user in the startContainer requests. Similarly APPLICATION_STOP should only be sent to Auxiliary services specified by the user during the startContainer call., Hi [~sseth], I just quickly check the current code base and didn't find any inconsistency here between INIT and STOP. Am I missing anything or can we resolve this JIRA as invalid?, [~djp] - this looks like it's still valid. START is sent to the service that the app specified. STOP is sent to all AuxServices.]
