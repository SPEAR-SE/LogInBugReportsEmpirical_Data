[I meant whether we should add callback here(please see attacked patch). If we should care for backward compatibility, it's a straight way to add onUnregisteredApplicationRequest() to CallbackHandler. What do you think, [~zjshen]?, [~ozawa] Do we really need this ? Looks like we have handle it on HeartbeatThread. For the CallbackHandler, I think that this is used for handling the response. So, probably no need for callbackHandler.]
