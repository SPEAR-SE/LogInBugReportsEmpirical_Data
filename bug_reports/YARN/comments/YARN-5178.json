[Thanks [~tuyuri] for reporting the issue. Could you please upload two RMs logs if it is possible? It seems caused by that the RMApp was in ACCEPTED state and RM HA started before none of RMAppAttempt was saved., RS1 log, Sorry Jun Gong, it 's my mistake , i didn't stop cluster to get log , and so many other application ran , RS log is quite chao :D :D ,  it 's make too hard to read log , but i try to attached here , please find app : application_1464374175189_0016  to read log, Rs2 log, Thanks [~tuyuri] for sharing the logs.  I analyzed rs2 log, and found it is a same problem as YARN-2856: the application was at accepted state, and ignored event {{RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_KILLED}}. You could try the patch., [~hex108] tks for your helping , i will try this patch ]
