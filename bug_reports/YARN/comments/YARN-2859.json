[Binding the default port is not right for MiniYARNCluster. Will fix the problem., [~zjshen] Are you planning to look at this? 

[~vinodkv] this will be a good candidate for 2.6.1 , Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, [~zjshen], can this be done for 2.6.1, or are you OK with deferring it to 2.6.2?, Cannot stop 2.6.1 for this anymore, it is already way too late. Moving this to 2.6.2 and beyond., Taking a crack at this.

Simple patch to not use fixed ports for Timeline Service / ApplicationHistoryServer in MiniYARNCluster., \\

, This did not make 2.6.2 as its RC was already cut. I'll set it to 2.6.3 once that version is created. I'll also recreate the CHANGES.txt entry under 2.6.3 at that time., [~sjlee0] as you mentioned in YARN-4350, your hunch  was in deed correct. This fix is not correct and when we try to execute distributed shell, AM fails with following logs 
{code}
2015-11-14 07:30:04,851 INFO  [main] impl.ContainerManagementProtocolProxy (ContainerManagementProtocolProxy.java:<init>(81)) - yarn.client.max-cached-nodemanagers-proxies : 0
2015-11-14 07:30:05,459 INFO  [main] impl.TimelineClientImpl (TimelineClientImpl.java:serviceInit(296)) - Timeline service address: http://root1-ThinkPad-T440p:0/ws/v1/timeline/
2015-11-14 07:30:05,476 INFO  [main] impl.TimelineClientImpl (TimelineClientImpl.java:logException(213)) - Exception caught by TimelineClientConnectionRetry, will try 30 more time(s).
{code}
Actual fix should be making use of {{ServerSocketUtil.getPort}}
something like 
{code}
 String hostname = MiniYARNCluster.getHostname();
        int port = ServerSocketUtil.getPort(7188, 10);
        conf.set(YarnConfiguration.TIMELINE_SERVICE_ADDRESS,
            hostname + ":" + port);
        conf.set(YarnConfiguration.TIMELINE_SERVICE_WEBAPP_ADDRESS,
            hostname + ":" + port);
{code}
which can make it work. If required i can provide a patch for this. Please inform., Missed to mention that its visible when we run TestDistributedShell., oops fix would be 
{code}
 String hostname = MiniYARNCluster.getHostname();
 conf.set(YarnConfiguration.TIMELINE_SERVICE_ADDRESS,
      hostname + ":" + ServerSocketUtil.getPort(9188, 10));
 conf.set(YarnConfiguration.TIMELINE_SERVICE_WEBAPP_ADDRESS,
      hostname + ":" + ServerSocketUtil.getPort(9288, 10));
{code}
Same port cannot be used twice!
, Reopening the JIRA to look at the issue., Thanks for looking [~Naganarasimha]. But I'm not sure if that is the reason for test timeouts for YARN-4350. Using ":0" should have the same effect of finding an available ephemeral port if I'm not mistaken. Also, all other daemons in the mini YARN cluster are doing that without issues.
, It's unfortunate that Jenkins doesn't run dependent component tests - that would have easily caught this.

IAC, here's a patch that fixes it - we simply were not updating the conf with TimelineService address after we start it - this is important specifically when we configure the server with ephemeral ports. And DistributedShell is broken in that it depends on server conf - there was a JIRA for this, let me dig that up., The patch doesn't have additional tests as the existing TestDistributedShell validates the fix., Thanks for informing [~sjlee0],
May be the scenario is little different in YARN-2928, but i ran the {{TestDistributedShell}} in 2.7.2 and i found that Distributed shell's AM itself was not launching and the exception was clear saying {{(TimelineClientImpl.java:serviceInit(296)) - Timeline service address: http://root1-ThinkPad-T440p:0/ws/v1/timeline/}}  which signified that the client was taking ephemeral port to get connected to the server.
Will check further how its working for other ports.

, Dint see these messages, analyzed and finally found the same reason! 
Addendum patch looks fine, let me apply and test once!, Dint see these messages, analyzed and finally found the same reason! 
Addendum patch looks fine, let me apply and test once!, Could you also check if this resolves the timeout issue in YARN-4350? That might be a separate issue?, It should resolve as i first fixed with my approach and it was working fine. But i feel the there might be some other issue trying to find out why the behavior is different in YARN-4350, will update in that jira!, +1, after applying Addendum patch, Tests are passing for Distributed Shell., Hi [~vinodkv] & [~sjlee0],
Though the addendum patch fixes the TestDistributedShell issue in 2.7.2, it had impacts in ATSv2 branch. On further checking realized that in trunk and 2.7.2 , {{yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled}} was not set to true in TestDistributedShell.setupInternal in but was required to be set in ATSv2 branch.
Further to rectify i faced following issues, 
# In MiniYARNCluster RM servicewrapper is first added and then AHSwrapper, and also actual AHS service is started in a thread, so RM's will be using the wrong timelineclient address(port is zero) as AHS service is not yet initialized.
# In Timeline client Impl's *serviceInit* URI for timeline REST service is set. So even though we create the correct service order (as per previous step), RM's SMP will fail to publish, as timelineweb address is got only after the AHS service is started. 
Even after this (though got the right port) was still facing some issues.

So if *MINI YARN cluster is required to be used with system-metrics-publisher enabled*, either we need to start correcting series of issues or use other simpler option  {{ServerSocketUtil.getPort(9188, 10)}}, which i feel is safer and used in many other places.But would req different patches for 2.6.2 !, Just to be sure, those 3 issues you mentioned impact only the timeline service v.2 (YARN-2928) branch and do not impact trunk, correct?, Hi [~sjlee0],
Ok to reword it , suppose we enable {{yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled}} in 2.7.2 and run TestDistributedShell then we face the same problem(SMP will fail to connect to timeline server) with the miniyarn cluster. Hence this fix is not complete fix but none of the test cases fail. So if *MINI YARN cluster is required to be used with system-metrics-publisher enabled* then its required to fix and its faster to fix in my way.  If MINIYARN cluster doesn't require *system-metrics-publisher enabled* then for ATS v2 we will have to change it as part of YARN-4350., [~Naganarasimha] I agree that it (_MiniYARNCluster not letting you enable system-metrics-publisher inside RM_) is an existing issue even on trunk/branch-2 but the right solution is to fix the ordering in MiniYARNCluster to start things in the right order and propagate configuration correctly. I'll file a a separate ticket for this.

[~xgong], as you committed my first patch, can you review the addendum too? Thanks., bq. Naganarasimha G R I agree that it (MiniYARNCluster not letting you enable system-metrics-publisher inside RM) is an existing issue even on trunk/branch-2 but the right solution is to fix the ordering in MiniYARNCluster to start things in the right order and propagate configuration correctly.
