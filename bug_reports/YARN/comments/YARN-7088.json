, I know you're working on getting the patch working still, but here are a couple of initial comments:

# The {{ApplicationReport.getLaunchTime()}} javadocs should be verbose about what a launch time is compared with what a start time is.  It should probably also explain that the current state of affairs is because of compatibility of the web services endpoints.
# In the protos you can't change previously assigned numbers.  Put the launch time at the end.
# I see both "launch" time and "launched" time.  You should probably pick one., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The unit test failure is unrelated.  The checkstyle issues aren't directly your fault, but it would be swell if you could clean them up.  I'll take a closer look at the patch when I get a chance., Thanks [~daniel@cloudera.com], I'll take a look at the checkstyle issues and upload a patch that resolves your earlier comments as well., Few comments:
# In FileSystemApplicationHistoryStore, Long.MAX_VALUE is used instead of Long.MIN_VALUE for launchTime. Is this intentional?
# I could see that you are setting start time when application is registered in RM. Looks fine.
# Also pendingTime is updated as difference between *app.getStartTime()* and *app.getLaunchTime())*. This delta is ideally the time application has spent in RM till app started running. Hence pendingTime seems not correct and bit confusing.  May be some thing like *elapseTimeTillLaunch* or "schedulingWaitTime" or something better :)
, Thanks [~sunilg]. Regarding your first point, this is intentional as an initial value for launchTime because it is part of the ApplicationFinishData, as the field will have been set by the time the application has finished.

For the pendingTime name, isn't the difference between app.getStartTime() and app.getLaunchTime() essentially the same as the difference between when the app is submitted and launched? From what I've seen, the application is registered in the RM very soon after it is submitted. Therefore, pendingTime is describing how long the application was pending before it actually began running, which makes sense in that context. Furthermore, the placement between the start and launch time in both UI's makes it clear what delta it is measuring. Let me know what you think and I'd be curious if anyone else has any thoughts on this., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, bq.same as the difference between when the app is submitted and launched? From what I've seen, the application is registered in the RM very soon after it is submitted. 

This is not same. Essentially when u have max-am-percent is hit, APP will be accepted state for longer time. Hence it depends on the scheduler by which it can provide AM container sooner. Hence pending seems confusing and not accurate name., Sorry, to clarify, I meant the delta between startTime and launchTime vs the delta between submitTime and launchTime. I think I'm not seeing why pendingTime is confusing because I'm thinking of it as referencing the application's pending state after it is accepted and before it begins running., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, {code}
184	        this.pendingTime = Times.elapsed(app.getStartTime(),
185	            app.getLaunchTime());
186	        this.elapsedTime = Times.elapsed(app.getLaunchTime(),
187	            app.getFinishTime());
{code}

*elapsedTime* could depend on scheduler wait queue as we discussed. I guess *pendingTime* is indicated as time between app start from RM and its registration time. If app is registered later, this value at time may not be very small in seconds.

Since we need to project time different between "app start" and "app registration", *pending* is still vague. Even if the length of variable a little bigger and if it serves a better readability, i think it might be fine. Could we say "pendingTimeTillRegistration" or some thing smaller if possible :)
, Main change in this patch is that the launch time is actually set to the when the app has launched, and not when it is being registered. [~sunilg] Since pendingTime is now the delta between the app start time and the true launch time, hopefully pendingTime works better to describe that period of time. , IIUC, there are few fields we are trying to define based on trunk as well as this patch.

||Types||Definition||Calculation||
|*submitTime*|Submission time of app from ClientRMService#submitApplication|N/A|
|*startTime*|When RMApp is created in RMAppManager during submission of an app|N/A|
|launchTime|When RM has allocated master container for AM and RMAppAttempt reaches LAUNCHED state|N/A|
|*finishTime*|When AM un-registered or RMApp's end time in case of failure|N/A|
|*elapsedTime*|Time difference between app start and finish|finishTime-startTime|
|schedulingWaitTime/pendingTime|Time difference between app launch and start time to get scheduling wait time|launchTime-startTime|
|totalRunTime|Time difference between app launch and finish so that we get whole run time|finishTime-launchTime|

We have some of this fields which are marked bold and other proposed in this patch except *totalRunTime*. I think addition of *launchTime* makes sense. *pendingTime* was lil confusing as it was not clear what it was pending for.  I was also thinking *schedulingWaitTime* is more clear than pendingTime. If others feels pendingTime fine, i think i am also good, lets get this in :). I am looping [~rohithsharma] who worked in App Timeout feature if he has some more thoughts.

Please correct me and update if any definitions are not correct. By the way I have another major query though, during recovery how could we save *launchTime*. We cannot change this value after RM restart as APP may be already running. Recovery might need a relook with respect to launchTime.


, Adding few more points
# Its better not to rely on Attempts to update launchTime. If re-attempts happen, this value could be overwritten.
# Also *elapsedTime* need not have to redefined as diff b/w finish and launch. Its correct as a diff b/w finish and start. May be totalRunTime what I proposed also could be skipped as it may confuse.

, [~sunilg] This patch saves the launchTime during recovery. pendingTime has been renamed to schedulingWaitTime, there is now a totalRunTime, and elapsedTime behaves as it did before. Also, the launchTime will not be overwritten by another attempt because it is only set if it has not been set yet. If this passes tests, hopefully this is good to go., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~sunilg], [~haibo.chen], I have uploaded the patch that has passed the tests. The current patch addresses the following:
 # Add launchTime, schedulingWaitTime and totalRunTime
 # I changed the original patch slightly and now launchTime update happens via the event that is sent to the RMApp state machine.
 # Has the UI change(for old UI only)

I will create separate tickets/patches for the below for launchTime to be added to the new UI and ATS
 # Writing to the ATSV1
 # Writing to ATSV2
 # New UI change
 # ATSV1.5??, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~kanwaljeets] for the patch! I have a few questions/comments around the core state machine changes you've made in this patch.

1)  
{code:java}
 private static final class AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition
      extends  RMAppTransition {
    @Override
    public void transition(RMAppImpl app, RMAppEvent event) {
      LOG.info("update the launch time");
      if(app.launchTime == 0) {
        app.launchTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
      }
    }
  }{code}
We are generating the timestamp when RMAppImpl is notified of the launch. But the correct timestamp should come from RMAppAttemptEventType.LAUNCHED that is generated by AMLauncher. If the event dispatch thread is falling back, there could be a large gap between when RMAppImpl is notified and when the attempt is actually launched.

2) I see two transitions are added to RMAPPImpl state machine, namely ACCEPTED --> ACCEPTED and RUNNING --> RUNNING upon the new RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED. However, I could not think of the possibility of receiving a ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED event while the state machine is in RUNNING state. Can you please elaborate a little more on that?

3) Some minor comments: there is an unused variable you added in AMLaunchedTransition; the log in AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition  is too generic. Can we add application id, attempt id and the timestamp?;

The change in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/proto/server/application_history_server.proto is unnecessary as you have decided not to change for ATS (all versions). 

The schedulingWaitTime in AppInfo is misleading if one application has multiple attempts. Because the launch time is updated everytime a new attempt is launched, we can rename it to the launch time of the latest attempt. If there are mutiple attempts, the running time of previous attempts would be counted as schedulingwait time, which is not correct., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~haibochen] for the comments. Here are my responses
{quote}We are generating the timestamp when RMAppImpl is notified of the launch. But the correct timestamp should come from RMAppAttemptEventType.LAUNCHED that is generated by AMLauncher. If the event dispatch thread is falling back, there could be a large gap between when RMAppImpl is notified and when the attempt is actually launched.
{quote}
I have addressed the above by adding a new constructor to update the timeStamp in the data members of _RMAppEvent and RMAppAttemptEvent_ classes.

 
{quote}I see two transitions are added to RMAPPImpl state machine, namely ACCEPTED --> ACCEPTED and RUNNING --> RUNNING upon the new RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED....
{quote}
I have addressed this by removing the unwanted transition handling state change of RUNING --> RUNNING

 
{quote}Some minor comments: there is an unused variable you added in AMLaunchedTransition; the log in AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition  is too generic. Can we add application id, attempt id and the timestamp?

The change in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/proto/server/application_history_server.proto is unnecessary as you have decided not to change for ATS (all versions). 
{quote}
Done as suggested

 
{quote}The schedulingWaitTime in AppInfo is misleading if one application has multiple attempts. Because the launch time is updated everytime a new attempt is launched, we can rename it to the launch time of the latest attempt. If there are mutiple attempts, the running time of previous attempts would be counted as schedulingwait time, which is not correct.
{quote}
I update the launchTime only if it is non zero so I guess we are fine here?

 

Four tests failed in the last run. Three are from *TestMRTimelineEventHandling*. I verified that they fail even without my changes and if I increase the timeout of the below snippet from 30 seconds, they pass, so my guess is they are flaky and not related to my changes.

 
{code:java}
public static RunningJob runJobSucceed(JobConf conf, Path inDir, Path outDir)
       throws IOException {
  conf.setJobName("test-job-succeed");
  conf.setMapperClass(IdentityMapper.class);
  conf.setReducerClass(IdentityReducer.class);
  
  RunningJob job = UtilsForTests.runJob(conf, inDir, outDir);
  long sleepCount = 0;
  while (!job.isComplete()) {
    try {
      if (sleepCount > 300) { // 30 seconds
        throw new IOException("Job didn't finish in 30 seconds");
      }
      Thread.sleep(100);
      sleepCount++;
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      break;
    }
  }
{code}
The other test *org.apache.hadoop.yarn.client.api.impl.TestAMRMClient.testAMRMClientWithContainerResourceChange* shows the same trace as reported by [~rchiang] in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-6272

 

 , {quote}I update the launchTime only if it is non zero so I guess we are fine here?
{quote}
Sorry, I misunderstood the patch. But I am still not sure if we should add schedulingwait time and total run time. If an application have more than one attempts, and the following attempt(s) spend some time waiting to be scheduled, then the two metrics are not accurate. Thus, I'm inclined to not add them.

Besides, I have a few more minor comments.

1) The change to remove the period in ApplicationReport.getName() javadoc is unnecessary. That's why checkstyle is warning about this.

2) ApplicationReport.setLaunchTime should be marked as Private & Unstable, whereas getLaunchTime should be annotated with Public & Unstable, following the conventions

3) ApplicationMetricsConstants.APP_ATT_LAUNCHED_EVENT_TYPE is unused.

4) The name of  AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition is misleading. How about we rename it to AttemptLaunchedTransition?

5) RMAppImpl.setLaunchTime() is not needed I think., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~haibochen], I addressed the comments. Only one test failed this time and I again doubt it is related. It passes on my laptop with the changes.

Let me know what your thoughts are., Thanks for the update! Can you please clean up schedulingwaitTime and totalRunTime in AppInfo.java?

Also, the log statement in AttemptLaunchedTransition should be enclosed in the if clause when we actually update the launch time stamp., +1 pending Jenkins., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Will check it in tomorrow if there is no objection., HI [~haibochen]

Cud u pls hold on this for a day. I am reviewing this patch now., Sure., Oh Sorry [~haibochen], I didnt see that its was committed and u have reverted as per the my comment above.

Extremely sorry for late trouble caused.

 

I saw jenkins compile error as below:  I ll also debug in my local now
{code:java}

[ERROR] COMPILATION ERROR : 
[INFO] -------------------------------------------------------------

One major dbt is on RMAppImpl
{code:java}
if(app.launchTime == 0) {
..
..
..
}{code}
If one attempt is launched and {{launchTime}}, then what if this attempts fails and 2nd attempt is started. In that case, this value should be updated, correct?, Hi [~sunilg], Thanks for the comment. I checked, build succeeds in my laptop too. On the launchTime thing, the intent was to explicitly record the launchTime and not re-write it over restarts. I hope that helps. Similar thoughts were shared by [~ayousufi] in the past. Here is the old message

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-7088?focusedCommentId=16151335&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-16151335

 , Ok. Thanks for pointing this.

I am still bit confused though. It may be because of the variable name called launchTime. An app is started when we create RMApp. But per scheduler, an app is started when an attempt is launched (post scheduling). Now I can see that the launchTime what we discuss here is the same. Now multiple attempts could happen, and one may succeed. Still launchTime will be first attempt's launchTime. Are we looking for this time itself ? because for attempt, i can understand what is attempt launch. Now for an app, what is the difference b/w app start vs app launch. if we clearly looking for this, then its fine. , [~sunilg], we are looking explicitly at first launchTime and do not want to care about subsequent attempt launches if app restarts. Hence when attempt is launched, we record the time only if it is unset(i.e. zero). Any subsequent launches are not considered. , Thanks for the clarification. I can see the reason for this now. However could u pls confirm whether we have launchTime per attempt as well published in similar way. If not, we can add in other jira. I think this Jira is good to go now. Thanks and sorry for the trouble lately., thanks [~sunilg] for inputs. Before resolving this Jira, I would file one as per your suggestion. There are few more around ATS that I anyways have to file as well that relate to this JIRA, That's a good point, [~sunilg]. The launchTime per attempt should be added. [~kanwaljeets] can you file a follow-up Jira for that?

 , Oops, I did not refresh often enough.   I'll commit the Jira shortly. Thanks [~sunilg] for the review!]
