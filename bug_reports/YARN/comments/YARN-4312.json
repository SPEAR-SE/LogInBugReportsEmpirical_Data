, +1, checking this in. 

* A failure of TestResourceTrackerService is reported as YARN-3580. Confirmed that it passes with the patch. I'll backport it.
* A failure of TestClientRMTokens is reported as YARN-4306.
* A failure of TestAMAuthorization looks to be not related to this issue since the reason of the failure is UnknownHostException., 2.6.2 is releasing. For now, committing this to branch-2.7 and backport this to branch-2.6 after releasing 2.6.3.
, Committed the patch to branch-2.7. I'll cherry-pick it branch-2.6 after releasing 2.6.2.
