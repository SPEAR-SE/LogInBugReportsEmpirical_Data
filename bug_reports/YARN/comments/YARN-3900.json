[Simply printing EpochProto.toString causes the following error which on debugging shows the culprit.
The exception is thrown in Descriptors  
{noformat}
 for (int i = 0; i < proto.getDependencyCount(); i++) {
        if (!dependencies[i].getName().equals(proto.getDependency(i))) {
          throw new DescriptorValidationException(result,
            "Dependencies passed to FileDescriptor.buildFrom() don't match " +
            "those listed in the FileDescriptorProto.");
{noformat}
And looking at the variables the mismatch is for
{noformat}
dependencies[i].getName() = {java.lang.String@856} "server/yarn_security_token.proto"
proto.getDependency(i) = {java.lang.String@857} "yarn_security_token.proto"
{noformat}
