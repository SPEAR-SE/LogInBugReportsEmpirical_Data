[Uploaded a patch to handle the possible attempt_unregistered, attempt_failed, attempt_finished state at app_killing state., Instead, we could get rid of the killing state completely and let app stay at the original state and change RMApp to handle attempt_killed state at each possible state.  this way, we could avoid race condition like this.  I'll file a separate  jira to do this., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This is not correct. If app accept kill signal from the user, we should not continue running the app., bq. This is not correct. If app accept kill signal from the user, we should not continue running the app.
right,  updated the patch to kill the app if this is not the last attempt. if the failed attempt is the last attempt, the app state remains failed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
