[I found that this problem is caused when the system locale is not English., Hi, [~ozawa], did not reproduce this locally, what is the environment you are running ?, Hi Jian, LANG in my environment is ja_JP.UTF-8., Fix to set LANG as C., bq. I found that this problem is caused when the system locale is not English.
Ahh, can you please close it ? thanks , Closing this problems itself is no problem.
The essential problem is there are no document in hadoop project about locale. IMHO, we should document it instead of fixing this problem. The document as follows are candidates to fix.

1. http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute
2. BUILDING.txt.
