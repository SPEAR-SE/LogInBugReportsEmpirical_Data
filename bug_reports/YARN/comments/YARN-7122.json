[Please see qbt result (https://builds.apache.org/job/hadoop-qbt-trunk-java8-linux-x86/507/testReport/)  for the detail., I ran git bisect and found YARN-6640 broke this. Now I'm investigating the root cause., After YARN-6640, AM throws InvalidApplicationMasterRequestException if when request.responseId > lastResponseId. In AMSimulator, the response id of the request is wrongly initialized to 1, and it passed unintentionally before YARN-6640.

001 patch
* Initialize the response id to 0
* Avoid incrementing the response id to avoid overflow, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
