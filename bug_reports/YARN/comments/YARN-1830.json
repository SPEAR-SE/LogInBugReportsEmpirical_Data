[See the same failure reported on YARN-1389, If I understand correctly, the race condition happens here:
{code}
int timeoutSecs = 0;
    while (loadedApp1.getAppAttempts().size() != 2 && timeoutSecs++ < 40) {;
      Thread.sleep(200);
    }

    assertQueueMetrics(qm2, 1, 1, 0, 0);
{code}

When the second attempt is created via recovery, the submitted app count will stay at 0 until RECOVER event is processed. If assertQueueMetrics is executed before it, the failure will occur., Already started working on the patch., Upload a patch to see whether the failure can be get rid of., Never mind the comment race, please take it back.., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
