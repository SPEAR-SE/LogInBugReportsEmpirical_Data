[Hi [~wangda],
IIUC we need to make all the methods to have @Private audience right, as all methods over here are for administrative purpose ?
if you already have a patch for this, please feel free to reassign :)
, [~Naganarasimha], thanks for taking this.
Actually I'm not sure about what should be the correct audience setting for ResourceManagerAdministrationProtocol, as a public API, it should be @Public. But actually, it will only used by RMAdminCLI, I don't know is there any 3rd party projects writing their own "admin CLI" and implements ResourceManagerAdministrationProtocol.

To not break compatibility, I think simple solution is to only change ResourceManagerAdministrationProtocol from @Private to @Public. I don't know if there's any thoughts about this., uploading with initial patch, \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~Naganarasimha]! The quick fix LGTM., [~Naganarasimha], I've seen other tickets where you set fix-version. Our protocol is for contributors set target-version if needed and committers setting fix-version at commit-time. Fixing this one by myself, but please take that note for future., bq. Actually I'm not sure about what should be the correct audience setting for ResourceManagerAdministrationProtocol, as a public API, it should be @Public. But actually, it will only used by RMAdminCLI, I don't know is there any 3rd party projects writing their own "admin CLI" and implements IIRC,
I originally intended ResourceManagerAdministrationProtocol to be private. But folks put Public annotation on the methods unfortunately.

I just checked the api docs, it doesn't seem to appear there. Can others confirm too? If confirmed, we can simply mark everything as private., Hi [~vinodkv], Point noted :), as per my knowledge i think mistakenly set in 2 jiras and it was not intentional (if so would have set to earlier version than 2.8.0). My 2 cents here, if there is an option in the jira to disable/enable editing for particular group then can we apply that such that Fix version can be added/modified by committers only ?, Have checked the 2.7.0 api docs and neither this class nor its package has been captured. Hence have modified visibility of the methods as private in this updated patch, \\

This message was automatically generated., I think we should also mark all interface to be @Unstable instead of @Stable. Thoughts, [~vinodkv]?, Doesn't matter much for private APIs, but sure.., in that case better to remove @Stable and not add  @Unstable .. thoughts ?, Makes sense., updated the patch with removal of \@stable, \\

This message was automatically generated., Latest patch LGTM. However, I think we don't need @Private for every method because we already specified it in class level. In most cases, we need some different visibility in method level is to override the class level. [~vinodkv], what do you think?, thanks for the review [~djp],
Well my view is to have  @Private at every method to avoid in future similar mistake as currently happened.  Thoughts ?, bq. Well my view is to have @Private at every method to avoid in future similar mistake as currently happened. Thoughts?
OK. This should be fine also.
+1. Patch LGTM.
