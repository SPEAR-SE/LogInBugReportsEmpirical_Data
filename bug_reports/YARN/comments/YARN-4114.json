This message was automatically generated., [~bibinchundatt], thanks for reporting this, I think we'd better not change this:
- It's not intrusive in xml, but actually, it's standard way to express an array in xml. When you viewing json version of the scheduler REST API, you can found:
{code}
            "nodeLabels": [
              "x",
              "y"
            ],
{code}

- It is released in 2.7 already, we need make API compatible.

Let me know your thoughts. And please close this ticket if you agree with me.

Thanks,

, Since the change will be incompatible will not change the same.]
