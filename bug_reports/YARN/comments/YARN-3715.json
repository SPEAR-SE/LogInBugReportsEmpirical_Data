[There are problem in "yarn.resourcemanager.address" property. When we try submitting regular job this property set to "0.0.0.0:8032", but when Oozie submitting job this property set to jobtracker property from file
job.propertires. 
In case with RM HA we set to job.properties 
    jobTracker=maprfs:///
and then "yarn.resourcemanager.address" also set to "maprfs:///". 
Then Master.getMasterAddress get socket address from Configuration as "maprfs:///" and call NetUtils.createSocketAddr(address, defaultPort, name), but NetUtils.createSocketAddr can work only with format “hostname:port”. 
I think that for case when using RM HA need call getSocketAddr(String name, String defaultAddress, int defaultPort) from YarnConfiguration class. 
, Doubt if this is a real bug - likely a configuration/environment issue.

In any case, please first try to resolve user issues in the user mailing lists (http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html).

The JIRA is a place to address existing bugs/new features in the project. Closing this for now. Thanks., Yes, it was configuration issue. Thanks]
