Looks like the Hadoop filesystem layer "helpfully" changed what was originally an IOException into an FSError.  FSError is _not_ an Exception, so the try...catch(Exception) block in LocalizerRunner.run doesn't catch it.  It then bubbles up to the top of the thread, and the uncaught exception handler kills the whole process.

We should consider catching Throwable rather than Exception in LocalizerRunner.run, or at least also catch FSError since it will be a common and recoverable error in this case., bq. catch FSError since it will be a common and recoverable error in this case.

This message is automatically generated., [~varun_saxena], Thanks for posting this patch.

Rather than duplicating the catch blocks, I would like to see the {{catch}} blocks save off the exception and fserror, then process it during the {{finally}} block.

So, what I'm suggesting is before the {{try}} block, add a {{Throwable}} variable:
{code}
Throwable t = null;
{code}
In the catch blocks, save the exception and error:
{code}
} catch (Exception e) {
  t = e;
} catch (FSError fse) {
  t = fse;
}
{code}
Then, move what used to be in the original {{catch (Exception e)}} block into the {{finally}} block surrounded by 
{code}
if (t != null) {
  ...
}
{code}

Also, please add a unit test., [~eepayne], thanks for your comments.

Will add a test case.

I actually wanted a different message to be printed in logs for these exceptions. And other than that there is only one extra line. Thoughts ?, I can probably write a small method to consolidate these duplicate lines., Thanks for your reply, [~varun_saxena],
bq.  I actually wanted a different message to be printed in logs for these exceptions. I can probably write a small method to consolidate these duplicate lines.
If you want to include separate messages, then separate sections is probably fine. However, the "cause" message in the exception/FSError will give more information, so separate message is probably not necessary. If you do choose to have separate catch blocks, the message for FSError should probably say "filesystem error" rather than "disk error." The FSError may be related to the filey system, but not necessary a problem with the disk. Also, I would not add the overhead of a separate method just to save a couple of lines of code., I vaguely remember that [~vvasudev] had a bug report and more analysis on these type of errors somewhere. [~vvasudev], can you find out and help look at this? Tx., Hmm, you are correct. Stack trace should have enough information., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
