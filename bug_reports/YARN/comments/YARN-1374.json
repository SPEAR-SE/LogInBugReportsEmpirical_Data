[It is occurring when the scheduler monitor is enabled using 'yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.monitor.enable' configuration.

SchedulingMonitor service is getting added to RM services during RM services init which is causing ConcurrentModificationException. SchedulingMonitor service needs to be added to RMActiveServices instead of adding to RM service to avoid this., If this exists, my code. I'd put the list into an unmodifiable list to stop concurrency problems, because I knew the risk -adding children while adding children existed.

It looks like that isn't enough -we need to take a snapshot of the list and then iterate through it.

-steve, I see the issue. Will upload a patch shortly to add the SchedulingMonitor to RMActiveServices., Here is a patch that moves creating the monitor policies to RMActiveServices., Forgot to add license headers., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The test fails without the fix and passes with it. , +1 lgtm, while this patch fixes a symptom, it doesn't fix the underlying problem: you get an exception if you add a new service to a composite while it is being inited.

We can fix that by making sure that the service list is cloned before iterating through the init/start/stop methods. That way, code can add it, it just doesn't get processed in the current loop, Wouldnt it be incorrect to add a new service to an initing composite service? Depending on the race, the service would work or not work. So IMO we should see an error/exception though a better diagnostic message may help., Also, the patch fixes another bug. Without the patch, monitors get added to ResourceManager and not RMActiveServicss. , I agree with both the sides. But more to the last point that Karthik made - monitors are getting added to RM directly, though the intention wasn't that.

+1 for this patch as it fixes that issue. Let's file a separate ticket for the CompositeService issue.

Checking this in., [~bikassaha] -if we clone the list before iterating, the newly added siblings won't cause problems during the init or start operations -they won't get called. But: if you do then  add an uninited service during init, it won't get inited; add uninited or inited to start they won't get started. Maybe: allow an addition, but the service you add must always be in the same state of the composite service. That way, if you do add a new service -you have to get it into the correct state before the add() call.

, Committed this to trunk and branch-2, thanks Karthik!

Karthik/Bikas/Steve, can one of you file a bug for the CompositeService bug? Tx., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4695 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4695/])

, I filed HADOOP-10085 to follow this up. 

IMO, being able to add services to CompositeService while initing is more a wish than a requirement. ]
