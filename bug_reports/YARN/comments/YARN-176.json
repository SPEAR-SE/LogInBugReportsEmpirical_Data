[This patch overrides the Surefire configuration for the YARN modules to use the correct relative path for HADOOP_HOME to find winutils.  This resolves several test failures., +1 Looks Good To Me. But is there anyway we can consider loading all the windows utilities/binaries into a jar file and use them from the jar file? Is that a practical option?, Thank you, Raja.  The implementation inside Hadoop Common needs to call winutils.exe as an external process or hadoop.dll as a dynamically linked library.  Unfortunately, I do not think there is any way to package these artifacts in jar files., +1 for the patch. I committed it.

Thank you Chris for the patch. Thank you Raja for the review.]
