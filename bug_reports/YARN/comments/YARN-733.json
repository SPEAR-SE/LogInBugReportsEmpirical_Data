[Yes this is occasionally failing for me too ..., In the patch:
1. Update the tests to wait until the expected container status occur
2. In NMClientImpl, add a piece of javadoc to describe that startContainer/stopContainer returns doesn't mean container is actually started/stopped. There could be a transit container status.

Have run the test for tens of times, and no failure occurs., [~zjshen] small nit 
bq. may still need some time to make the container actually started or stopped because of its asynchronous
may still need some time to either start or stop the container because of its asynchronous

I hope we are not doing getContainerStatus after Application is finished in which case we won't have tokens at NM side for authentication., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Zhijie, can you address the nit pointed out by Omkar?

Also, the retry-code can be refactored and reused.., Fix the javadoc and refactor the test. Thank Omkar and Vinod for your review., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
