[The test is failing because there's a memory corruption error in the container-executor code, and that triggers a crash in malloc.  At least one problem is in string_utils.c which has this classic off-by-one error:
{code}
  char* input_cpy = malloc(strlen(input));
  strcpy(input_cpy, input);
{code}

strlen does not account for the terminating NUL character, so we end up allocating one byte less than we need and then promptly scribble past the end of the allocation.

Looks like this was introduced by YARN-6726., Attaching a patch that uses strdup instead of separate strlen/malloc/strcpy calls.  Arguably the existing unit test can be leveraged here since it was failing before., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for identifying the issue and the patch [~jlowe]. I have tested the patch locally and it resolves the issue with the test. +1 from me.

{code}, I'm +1 (non-binding) for the change. Because it's such a specific test and is already covered by the validate_container_id test failing, I'm on board with using the existing test. However, it might not be a bad idea to just generally add in some tests to test-container-executor to make sure that we aren't leaking memory or susceptible to simple overflows from the invocation, +1 on the patch. I will commit shortly.

YARN-7014. Fix off-by-one error causing heap corruption (Jason Lowe via (nroberts: rev d265459024b8e5f5eccf421627f684ca8f162112)

, Thanks [~jlowe]/[~shanekumpf@gmail.com]/[~ebadger]/[~nroberts] to fix this issue. It was caused by my previous mistake: native unit test result doesn't show in test-report (we can only see it from unit test output), so I commit the problematic patch, apologize to cause the issue.]
