[I see the same "negative" memory issue on Hadoop 2.7.0 . Were you able to find  the cause?, There are many cases where ProcfsBasedProcessTree (which I am assuming is what getting used, assuming Linux) returns UNAVAILABLE (-1 as a value).

Unfortunately we don't have enough logs in the code to identify those scenarios. Can you run "getconf CLK_TCK" and "getconf "PAGESIZE" on your box and paste the values here?]
