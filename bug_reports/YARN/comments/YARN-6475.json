[[~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] I am planning to pick this up. I am a newbie - can you help me with getting permissions to assign this issue to myself?, [~soumabrata] I have added you as a contributor, you can assign to yourself from now on., Thanks [~haibochen], Hi [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
I fixed the two method length related issues as described on this JIRA.

Before I raise a PR, just wanted to check with you on the following: 
There are 12 other violations related to method length in the project hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager.
Should I be addressing them too in this JIRA?  Or should those be addressed separately as part of a new JIRA?, Thank you, [~soumabrata]. I think you can address them as this jira., Hi [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
Turns out the project had about 5 method length related violations in src/main and the remaining in src/test
I fixed all of the violations in src/main
I left the ones in src/test as many had lots of Asserts and I felt that refactoring those would in fact reduce the readability 

Will raise a PR shortly, GitHub user soumabrata-chakraborty opened a pull request:

, Hi [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
Raised a PR for this issue - https://github.com/apache/hadoop/pull/218, +1 LGTM (non-binding) Thank you for the patch [~soumabrata]!, Thanks for working on the patch, [~soumabrata].  Looks generally good.  A few comments:
* In {{buildContainerRuntimeContext()}}, {{runAsUser}} is only used once, so you may as well inline it like you did with the rest of the attribute values.
* In {{deriveContainerWorkDir()}}, the {{StringBuilder}} is unnecessary.  The compiler will turn + concatenation into a {{StringBuilder}} under the covers. If you think + concatenation would be easier to read, feel free to use it. Or indeed, this change may not be necessary.
* In {{prepareContainer()}}, your code: {code}    exec.prepareContainer(new ContainerPrepareContext.Builder()
        .setContainer(container)
        .setLocalizedResources(localResources)
        .setUser(container.getUser())
        .setContainerLocalDirs(containerLocalDirs)
        .setCommands(container.getLaunchContext()
          .getCommands()).build());{code} might be better formatted as: {code}    exec.prepareContainer(new ContainerPrepareContext.Builder()
        .setContainer(container)
        .setLocalizedResources(localResources)
        .setUser(container.getUser())
        .setContainerLocalDirs(containerLocalDirs)
        .setCommands(container.getLaunchContext().getCommands())
        .build());{code}
* In {{StatusUpdaterRunnable}}, we don't need an empty line after the class declaration.
* In {{StatusUpdaterRunnable}}, it looks like you have several places with 8-space indentation where 4-space should do.
* In {{StatusUpdaterRunnable.run()}}, you may as well replace {{if (containersToSignal.size() != 0)}} with {{if (!containersToSignal.isEmpty())}}
* In {{StatusUpdaterRunnable.run()}}, you should also fix the {{catch (Throwable)}}.  Either make it a multi-catch instead or just catch {{Exception}}.

Also, please post a patch from the PR to this JIRA so that the Jenkins pre-commit has something to chew on., [~templedf] Thanks for the review.

, Thanks [~templedf] and [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
I have closed the PR manually., [~templedf] / [~soumabrata], can we cherry-pick this to branch-2 as well.
Cherry-picking changes from trunk to branch-2 for classes like {{NodeStatusUpdaterImpl}} is becoming harder now since changes like the {{StatusUpdaterRunnable}} is not in branch-2, and we end up having to do a lot of copy paste., Sure.  [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com], wanna provide me a branch-2 patch when you get a chance?, [~soumabrata], could you provide the patch since you are the original contributor?, [~asuresh] [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com]
Sure I'll take it up.
What is branch-2 meant for?
