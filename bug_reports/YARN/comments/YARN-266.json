[Simple patch to fix the issue. , Just encountered this

+1!, I tested by submitting a bad job name (with a new line and an embedded image HTML tag).
1. With only escapeHtml, the new line causes the Javascript parser to throw an error
2. With only escapeJavascript, the embedded HTML image was rendered. This could lead to XSS
3. Javascript escaping the Html escaped string (as in the patch), got the correct behavior.
