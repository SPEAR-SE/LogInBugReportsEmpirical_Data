[Update a patch to fix this issue in (AM/NM/Container)LivelinessMonitor. I think there are also similar issues in other YARN components. Will file other JIRAs to follow up when we have MonotonicClock there., Hi [~djp]
Thanks for the patch. Yes, its better to use {{MonotonicClock}} generally.
We also use SystemClock in proportional preemption policy, I feel as you mentioned a general YARN ticket can handle all this together., Agree. LivelinessMonitor is more critical as it affects all YARN daemons/containers lifecycle, so I prefer we get in this first. 
Later, we can file two separate JIRAs: one for YARN and the other for MapReduce to address other places. I am sure there are many places to change as all timeout could be affected and we should be carefully. Hadoop/HDFS projects should already adopt this early., Yes. That sounds good. +1 for the patch.
For YARN/MR, I could also definitely help in getting it in shape once this is in., bq. For YARN/MR, I could also definitely help in getting it in shape once this is in.
Sure. Feel free to create/assign JIRA and work on it. I will help to review. Thanks! , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, hi [~djp], this is a good suggestion, and YARN-4177 provides some discussion on this, so link it., And will provide new patch of YARN-4177 once this is in., Thanks [~xinxianyin] for updating this, I missed this somehow.
It seems like you are handling Monotonic Clock in various YARN code which uses clock.
So it can be made as general ticket in YARN.
Meantime I will raise an MR ticket to handle this for MapReduce. MAPREDUCE-6562 is linked for the same., Thanks, [~sunilg]., Thanks [~xinxianyin] to link YARN-4177. I missed that discussion before. Make YARN-4177 as a general ticket for YARN sounds good to me., patch looks good to me. 
one minor suggestion, do you think we can change the base AbstractLivelinessMonitor to have a default constructor with   MonotonicClock and callers can use this constructor instead ?, Thanks Jian for review and comments. My first thought before is to replace {{AbstractLivelinessMonitor(String name, Clock clock)}} with {{AbstractLivelinessMonitor(String name)}} with MonotonicClock as default. However, we have {{TestAMLivelinessMonitor#testResetTimer}} need to set ControlledClock instead of SystemClock/MonotonicClock for test logic that means caller could use clock parameter in future for test purpose. May be we should keep current constructor there for more flexibility from caller?, we can actually add a separate one ?, Ok. That sounds good. Will update the patch soon., Update patch with incorporate Jian's comments., Hi [~djp]
Thanks for the updated patch. I have one doubt here, we could see tat {{SystemClock#getTime}} is *Public* and *Stable*. Now there is a note saying that its advisable to use {{MonotonicClock}}, so any annotation change is needed for {{SystemClock}}?, It depends on if any consumer of SystemClock are using it to track absolute time but not for duration or interval. I didn't check other calling places in YARN/MR, also theoretically, it could be consumers outside of YARN given this a public API. 
We may consider to mark this API as deprecated later if we check all known calling places are for duration or interval only. But for now, it could be better to keep annotation no changed but with NOTE., Yes. That's definitely a valid reason as per the current usage. Thank you very much for clarifying., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
