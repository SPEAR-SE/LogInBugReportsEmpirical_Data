[It's a known issue that new java.net.URI(String) looses file specifications on Windows.  If you instead use File.toURI() this does not happen.  This patch switches to that approach and is able to successfully serve up log files with a configuration like this

{code}
<property>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs</name>
    <value>F:/nmlogs</value>
</property>
{code}, [~cwelch] we should add some sort of unit test to confirm the behavior. I can see this bug getting re-introduced by mistake if someone is adding functionality or re-factoring code., Will do, making patch available so I can see the change run against existing tests., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
