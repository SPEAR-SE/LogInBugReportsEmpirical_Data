[When NodeStatusUpdaterImpl gets a REBOOT ,it enqueue a REBOOT event to the NM dispatcher's queue. While this event is getting processed ,it calls stop() and then cleanupContainers(), within cleanupContainers(), it puts the CMgrCompletedContainersEvent onto the queue. This event will not get processed until the stop() finishes, because they are processed by the same dispatcher's thread, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., When a reboot command is sent from RM, the node manager right now cleans up all containers and does a complete reboot.  We are thinking to change the behavior of rebooting the whole NM to only let it resync with RM, essentially restart the nodeStatusUpdater thread and reregister with RM. 
The reason to do this is that rebooting the whole piece may be an overhead work. Other services may not need to be rebooted. As long as RM is restarted and ensured that it has the same state as it is before restart. The thing matters here is to sync NM and RM such that they are also on the same page as they are before restart, just by killing containers and reregister. 
And in the future work of RM work-preserving restart, containers should not be all cleaned. For example , keeping track of the previously running containers and when NM receives a resync command, continue what its running before., Uploaded a patch, change NM behavior from REBOOT to RESYNC when the RM restarted, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Can you please update the patch? Tx., fix merge conflicts, Looked at the latest patch. Mostly looks good, but for one thing: We aren't stopping any startContainers() in transit, which may cause the newly added code (to wait for all containers for cleanup) to hang.

Few patch related comments:
 - NodeManager.cleanupContainers(): The log message needs to be fixed to not only say shutdown.
 - NodeStatusUpdaterImpl
    -- getNodeStatus(): It is much more than a getter, rename it to something like getNodeStatusAndUpdateContainersInContext()? Also add in to NodeStatusUpdater interface?
    -- The condidtional if(isStopped) isn't really needed, the thread dies on a resync anyways. Remove?
    -- rebootNodeStatusUpdater() can be protected?
 - TestNodeManagerReboot: The test shouldn't be using Resync API's anymore given the semantics change. Can you change it to directly use stop() and start()?
 - TestNodeManagerShutDown: rename getRegCount() to getNMRegistrationCount()
 - TestNodeStatusUpdater.getNodeManager(): Can cleanup the reboot related artifacts from this., YARN-495.4.patch fix last comments, except " stopping any startContainers() in transit,".
