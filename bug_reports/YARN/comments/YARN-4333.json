[In attached patch, we append app-level check for starvation stats to queue-level check in fairscheduler update thread. Only starvation due to fairShare is checked for app, since we don't have minShare for app. Also we record lastTimeAtFairShareThreshold for each appAttempt.
Now once one app is starving but the leaf queue is satisfied, it could also trigger preemption. , [~Tao Jie], I've added you to contributor list and assigned the JIRA to you., In updated patch，some improvements for preemption within queue：
1, When calculating resource deficit to preempt, we have {{resToPreempt}} which is total resource to preempt among queues, and {{Map<String, Resource> withinQueueResToPreempt}} which contains amount of resource to preempt within queues.
2, In preemptResource, we should consider both {{resToPreempt}} and {{withinQueueResToPreempt}}. And we will preempt resource due to {{withinQueueResToPreempt}}(if any) before {{resToPreempt}}.
3, Once we preempt container due to preemption within queue, we will add resouce to {{Map<String, Resource> resourceDeficitWithinQueues}}, which maintains resource preempted due to within-queue preemption for each queue. When scheduling resource, we will prefer queues those have resource deficit in resourceDeficitWithinQueues., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, [~kasha], would you take a look at this patch? , [~Tao Jie] - sorry, have been out of town for the past few weeks. Catching up on items. Will try and get to this later this week, but early next week seems more realistic. , Thanks a lot for filing this JIRA and working on it. The preemption logic is broken at different places. We have other JIRAs where preemption between sibling queues doesn't work well. 

Quickly skimmed through the patch here. Few high-level comments on the patch and preemption in general:
# Today, all preemption is top-down. When we encounter a {{Schedulable}} (app/queue) that is starved, we should trigger preemption from the closest parent that is not starved. Preempting resources from another application under the same leaf-queue that is over its fairshare is automatically taken care of.
# The preemptionTimeout and preemptionThreshold are defined for queues and not apps. We should decide on what values we want to use for apps. May be, our best bet is to use the ones the corresponding leaf-queue uses? 

[~ashwinshankar77], [~sandyr], [~asuresh] - would like to hear your thoughts as well. , [~kasha], Thank you for reply! I just took a look at YARN-3405 thanks to your comments.
Acturally there are 2 problem in this scenario:
1, Should consider starved apps other than leaf queues when calculate resource to preempt.
2, Should find the right queue/apps to preempt from.
Problem 2 seems to have the same root cause with YARN-3405. We'd better have a common approach to resolve this, maybe in another jira. 
More consideration maybe not related：

 we should trigger preemption from the closest parent that is not starved.
{quote}
Today calculating resource defict just iterate leaf queues, but selecting queue to preempt is  by top-down recursion. Is it necessary to have hierarchical preemption? or which would you prefer to preempt?
A, sibling queue/app just over fairshare B, the leaf queue with resource most over fairshare , I'm out of town until end of this week. Will take a look when I get back. Thanks!, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
