[[~shenyinjie] I believe you are facing this issue in non-secure cluster by enabling Acls. So this is issue with your cluster set up which doesn't contains proper filters to get user names. You should configure hadoop.http.filter.initializers=org.apache.hadoop.security.AuthenticationFilterInitializer in core-site.xml and use the REST API with query parameter i.e _?user.name=shenyinjie_. This should solve your issue

I am closing the JIRA as invalid. If you still couldn't achieve it, feel free to reopen and discuss it., secure cluster enabling Acls also has this issue., I strongly suspect this could be cluster set up issue. In secure cluster, cluster should contains SPNEGO configured. May be you can upload configurations that could help a little bit. ]
