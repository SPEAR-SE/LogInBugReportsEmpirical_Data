This message was automatically generated., The test failures look unrelated to the patch., Let me taking a look at this issue., [~ajisakaa] how did you reproduce the problem? Could you share the configuration to reproduce it?, Execute {{export LANG=it_IT}} and restart ResourceManager., [~ajisakaa] thanks for your help. I, however, cannot reproduce the bug by configuring export LC_ALL=it_IT and LANG=it_IT. Could you check whether this problem happens against current trunk? Or, please correct me if I have missing points.

One problem I found is the percentage of the app queue gets NaN - please check an attached file. Is this related issue?

Anyway, I agree with using StringFormat with locale. How about adding StringUtils.format()? It looks consistent fix with HADOOP-11602. We can add new tests against the new utility method., bq. Could you check whether this problem happens against current trunk? 
I checked this problem happened against current trunk (revision 618ba7).

bq. One problem I found is the percentage of the app queue gets NaN - please check an attached file. Is this related issue?
Probably it's because the used memory was divided by 0 in the following code:
{code:title=FairSchedulerQueueInfo.java}
    fractionMemUsed = (float)usedResources.getMemory() /
        clusterResources.getMemory();
{code}
Would you attach your yarn-site.xml and fair-scheduler.xml?, Attaching my settings., bq. How about adding StringUtils.format()? It looks consistent fix with HADOOP-11602. 
Good idea. I'll update the patch., bq. One problem I found is the percentage of the app queue gets NaN - please check an attached file. Is this related issue?
[~ozawa], did you launch NodeManager? I see NaN when there's no NodeManager., Yes, I launched NodeManager. yarn-site.xml looks same as mine overall. Are you running daemons on Linux? I'm trying on Mac OS., I'm running them on Linux., I'm running them on Linux., I'm running them on Linux., Sorry for duplicated comments :), Attaching v4 patch
* Use {{StringUtils.format}} instead of {{String.format(Locale.ENGLISH, ...)}}.
* Removed yarn.util.StringHelper.percent and use StringUtils.formatPercent instead., [~ajisakaa] maybe did you forget attaching the v4 patch?, [~ajisakaa] Could you attach the v4 patch, please ?, Thank you [~ozawa]. Attached v4 patch., and thanks [~xgong] for pinging me., \\
