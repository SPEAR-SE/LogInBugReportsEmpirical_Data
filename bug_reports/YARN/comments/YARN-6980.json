[Attach a patch, change the YARN_TIMELINESERVER_HEAPSIZE in "yarn" and "yarn.cmd"  to YARN_TIMELINE_HEAPSIZE., This is backward compatibility bits, so the variable should be YARN_TIMELINESERVER_HEAPSIZE as it was in branch-2.  Just looks like a mistake in yarn-env.sh.

It's worth pointing out that the *preferred* way to set memory for specific daemons in 3.x is to put the -Xmx in _OPTS, Thanks for your advice, [~aw]. Now I set both the Xms and Xmx in YARN_TIMELINESERVER_OPTS and it works, thank you.

I update the patch and changed it in yarn-env.sh back to YARN_TIMELINESERVER_HEAPSIZE, because I think it would cause some misleading.
