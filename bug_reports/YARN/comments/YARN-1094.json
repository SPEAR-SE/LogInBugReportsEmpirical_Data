[Here's a patch that fixes this bug.
 - Moved delegationTokenRenewer's start to be explicit and before the state-store starts.
 - Made GetDelegationTokenRequest.newInstance as static. This was a pre-existing bug!
 - Made fixes to consistently use RMDelegationTokenRenewer only in secure mode
 - Some cosmetic changes to call tokenRenewer as more specifically delegationTokenRenewer

TestRMRestart.testDelegationTokenRestoredInDelegationTokenRenewer fails with the same NPE without the code changes and passes with.

Also tested this on a single node secure setup where I first reproduced the NPE easily and verified that RM restart works as expected after the patch., Correct patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

my bad, should catch this in the first place

One comment:
addService(delegationTokenRenewer) is called in serviceInit, and then explicitly started in serviceStart, which may cause it start twice ?, bq.  addService(delegationTokenRenewer) is called in serviceInit, and then explicitly started in serviceStart, which may cause it start twice ?
Yes, I consciously left it like that. Service-start is idempotent, the second start is ignored., +1, lgtm , I see, +1, lgtm., Tx for the reviews Jian and Arun!
