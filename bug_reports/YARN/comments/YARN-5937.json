, Hello [~Naganarasimha]

Do you have any suggestions to the fix I proposed? Would you like to review this patch? Thanks a lot., Sorry for the delayed reply, Actually i was looking out for normal case also NM was not shutting down gracefully. Offlate i have not tested trunk code. Let me test if its there then we can fix both issues together. Existing solution seems fine to me !
