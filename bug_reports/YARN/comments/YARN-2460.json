[Same cautions here as I mentioned in MAPREDUCE-6057.  Please do not remove any properties that are referenced by the code, even if they aren't referenced by YarnConfiguration.

I'm surprised to see mapreduce.job.* properties here rather than mapred-default.xml, and that seems like a mistake.  The yarn.nodemanager.aux-services.mapreduce_shuffle.class is necessary to avoid having users specify the handler for the mapreduce_shuffle aux service, but we still make them explicitly configure yarn.nodemanager.aux-services to have mapreduce_shuffle if they want to run MapReduce jobs.

yarn.nodemanage.hostname is referenced by other yarn-default.xml entries.

yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.* should be renamed to yarn.resourcemanager.connect.*.  This appears to have been overlooked when YARN-1056 was fixed., bq. yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.* should be renamed to yarn.resourcemanager.connect.*. This appears to have been overlooked when YARN-1056 was fixed.

That's not quite right, they should be removed.  It looks like YARN-1056 added the appropriate yarn.resourcemanager.connect.* entries but the yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.* entries were orphaned during the process., I'm not sure what the consequence would be moving these properties to mapred-default.xml:

  mapreduce.job.hdfs-servers
  mapreduce.job.jar
, Can possibly be deleted, due to newer version of the property in YarnConfiguration and yarn-default.xml:

Original: yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.retry_interval.secs
New: yarn.resourcemanager.connect.retry-interval.ms
New exists in YarnConfiguration?  Yes
New exists in yarn-default.xml?  Yes

Original: yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.wait.secs
New: yarn.resourcemanager.connect.max-wait.ms
New exists in YarnConfiguration?  Yes
New exists in yarn-default.xml?  Yes

Original: yarn.resourcemanager.amliveliness-monitor.interval-ms
New: yarn.am.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms
New exists in YarnConfiguration?  Yes
New exists in yarn-default.xml?  Yes

Original: yarn.resourcemanager.nm.liveness-monitor.interval-ms
New: yarn.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms
New exists in YarnConfiguration?  Yes
New exists in yarn-default.xml?  Yes
, At least this one looks like it needs to be fixed in the XML file.

Original: yarn.resourcemanager.application-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs
New: yarn.am-rm-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs
New exists in YarnConfiguration?  Yes
New exists in yarn-default.xml?  No
, I'm not sure about this one:

Original: yarn.resourcemanager.container.liveness-monitor.interval-ms
New: Unknown
, Contains the following modifications:

1) Removing the following properties:

   yarn.ipc.serializer.type
   yarn.ipc.exception.factory.class
   yarn.resourcemanager.amliveliness-monitor.interval-ms
   yarn.resourcemanager.nm.liveness-monitor.interval-ms
   yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.wait.secs
   yarn.nodemanager.resourcemanager.connect.retry_interval.secs

2) Renamed

   yarn.resourcemanager.application-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs

   to

   yarn.resourcemanager.am-rm-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs, Submit for testing., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Any comments on this patch from anyone?, I quick double check seems to indicate that, yes, these properties aren't being used.

So +1 LGTM.  I'll commit here in a bit., Actually, there is a problem.... so taking back my +1. :(

The patch is slightly incomplete.  It renames yarn.resourcemanager.application-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-sec but doesn't 
rename the entries in in hadoop-tools/hadoop-sls/src/main/data/2jobs2min-rumen-jh.json .
, Okay, I'll fix that.  Thanks for finding it., Adding one more place where

  yarn.resourcemanager.application-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs

needs to be replaced with

  yarn.resourcemanager.am-rm-tokens.master-key-rolling-interval-secs
