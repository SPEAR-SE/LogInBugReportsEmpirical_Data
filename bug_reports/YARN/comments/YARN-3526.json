[looks like a duplicate of YARN-2605, I don't think this is a duplicate of YARN-2605. YARN-2605 fixes the issues in REST API to avoid meta-refresh. 
But this JIRA is about the issue when application master proxy server runs on the standby RM, the traffic to the proxy server gets incorrectly redirected. I have attached a patch to fix this. Please help to review., By default, on a QJM cluster, application master proxy server runs on the RM specified in yarn.resourcemanager.webapp.address. If this RM happens to be the standby, the RMWebAppFilter will filter the request to active RM, this causes the infinite loop on the web page.
The filter should not filter the requests to the proxy server because it is a different service than RM, and it could be a standalone service. , \\

This message was automatically generated., I see: it's the AM filter side of the proxy. Makes sense. I can see that both are needed, Is it possible for you to right a test-case? The thing we want to ensure is that the links work in both cases of embedded and non-embedded proxy-server., It seems to me that the way to do a test case would be to tease out the logic into its own class/method & test that, outside of a jetty. You can't do any live tests on a single machine which exhibit the problem, as all share the same IPAddr, [~cheersyang], assigning this to you. Please consider writing a test-case.., Hi Vinod

Sure let me add a test case., Hello [~steve_l] and [~vinodkv] 

I uploaded a new patch, I added test case into existing class TestRMFailover.testRMWebAppRedirect, where I believe that is the best place for it. However I found this method is marked as "Ignore" since YARN-2605 was committed. 

I tried to run the test case by reverting the changes YARN-2605 made, it works fine. But with the changes, I got NPEs. I created another issue to fix this unit test, need to discuss with [~xgong]. The JIRA number is YARN-3601., \\

This message was automatically generated., Looks good to to me. Vinod?

(ps: don't worry about whitespace in future. we just use {{git apply --whitespace fix}} when taking up the patch â€”let the machines to the work., bq. I uploaded a new patch, I added test case into existing class TestRMFailover.testRMWebAppRedirect, where I believe that is the best place for it. However I found this method is marked as "Ignore" since YARN-2605 was committed.
bq. I tried to run the test case by reverting the changes YARN-2605 made, it works fine. But with the changes, I got NPEs. I created another issue to fix this unit test, need to discuss with Xuan Gong. The JIRA number is YARN-3601.
Where is your test-case then? Can we add it here and let it be ignored till we have YARN-3601?, Hello Vinod

I added the test case in TestRMFailover.testRMWebAppRedirect as below

+    header = getHeader("Refresh", rm2Url + "/proxy/" + fakeAppId);
+    assertEquals(null, header);

when I gave a fake app ID, it will not return me a redirect link, this tests the coverage of embedded proxy server. (Now it is ignored because YARN-3601 is not yet resolved). The standalone mode can be tested in testWebAppProxyInStandAloneMode, so not necessary to add more., BTW, the test case was successful if I reserved the changes that YARN-2605 made. The only thing left is fixing YARN-3601 to remove the ignore mark., Any more suggestion to the patch ? I think it is ready for commit. , Thanks, [~cheersyang]

+1 LGTM. Will commit it later today if nobody has any other comments, Committed into trunk/branch-2/branch-2.7. Thanks, [~cheersyang]., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #7845 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/7845/])
