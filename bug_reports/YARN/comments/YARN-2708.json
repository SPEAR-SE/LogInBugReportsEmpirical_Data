[[~ted_yu],
Thanks for reporting this, however, the {{internalRemoveLabelsFromNode}} is called after {{checkRemoveLabelsFromNode}}. And the {{checkRemoveLabelsFromNode}} will check existence of all required NMs. If any of them doesn't exist, it will report error before invoke {{internalRemoveLabelsFromNode}}. Like 

{code}
      if (!nodeExisted) {
        String msg =
            "Try to remove labels from NM=" + nodeId
                + ", but the NM doesn't existed";
        LOG.error(msg);
        throw new IOException(msg);
      }
{code}

Does this make sense to you?

Thanks,
Wangda, Typo in the error message (existed -> exist):
"NM doesn't existed"]
