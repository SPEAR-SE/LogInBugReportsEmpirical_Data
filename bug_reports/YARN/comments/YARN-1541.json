This message is automatically generated., Can you add a test in TestRM? Validating transitions directly is not so useful., Added test in TestRM to test AM host and roc port are invalidated after attempt  is done., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., It's interesting to realize via the test that we are invalidating host/port information for finished apps. We shouldn't perhaps be doing that for succeeded apps? Apps may use this similar to final-tracking URL after YARN-1225.

In addition one more place where this invalidation is really helpful is when an AM crashed or expired and client doesn't get the same address while the RM is in the process of launching a new AM. Can you add a test for that?, bq. We shouldn't perhaps be doing that for succeeded apps?
Yup, new patch not invalidating the host and port for succeeded apps

Also added the test when between AM restarts., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
