[I believe the fix is to add a sleep in the test: 

{code}
      Long renewDateBeforeRenew = allTokensRM2.get(dtId1);
      try{
 +      // Sleep for one millisecond to make sure renewDataAfterRenew is greater
 +      Thread.sleep(1);
        // renew recovered token
        rm2.getRMDTSecretManager().renewToken(token1, "renewer1");
      } catch(Exception e) {
{code}, It looks like test get failed more frequently in recent Jenkins test, so I think we should have a quick fix on it. [~jianhe] and [~kkambatl], what do you think?, I faced a test fail as following:
{code}
