[[~varun_saxena] Are you working on this JIRA currently? If not may I take this up? Thanks!, Steve, when is this required ? In 2.9.0 or we are targetting it for trunk ?
Most of my bandwidth will be taken up by ATSv2 work. So if it is required immediately then probably Kuhu can take it up. I would not want to block it because of lack of bandwidth.
Let me know., For Slider, we are coping with things today (and fixed resource requirements), by doing an exit(-1) and restarting. This handles rolling upgrades provided requirements don't change and the restart frequency is below that of the failure window.

so ... cut it from your todo list for now and we'll see where it ends up.

thanks for offering to do it though â€”appreciated
, Thanks Steve for the clarification.]
