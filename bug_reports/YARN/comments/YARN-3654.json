[My proposal:
do similar things as YARN-2605, we need to create a NMWebAppFilter, and instead of simply adding the meta-refresh in html, we need to set 307 as response code, add Location which includes the redirect-url in response header and let the browser to handle the re-direction by itself., Makes sense., Create a patch based on my proposal.
Tested the patch in a single node cluster.
* use firefox (chrome and safari can not be used to do the test), in Preferences--> Advanced -->General, mark "Warn me when websites try to redirect or reload the page"
* start a historyserver, and configure yarn.log.server.url and point to historyserver log (such as http://localhost:19888/jobhistory/logs)
* Run a mapreduce job, and wait for the job finishes
* go to application web ui and click the log url in attempts table
* without the patch, the firefox browser will block the redirect and ask for the permission whether the redirection is allowed
* with this patch, it will directly redirect to the url that we re-configured in yarn-site.xml, \\
