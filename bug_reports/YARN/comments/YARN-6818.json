[Hi [~jhung],
  Would you mind uploading a patch ?, Hi, [~Naganarasimha], attached a patch for branch-2.7., Thanks [~jhung]. Good catch! A quick comment in test case

Its better to pass {{CommonNodeLabelsManager.NO_LABEL}} or a final string with "" as value instead of null in case of no-label scenario. In {{CSQueueUtils.loadCapacitiesByLabelsFromConf}}, I think its been done with an if..else case. It may be better this way for a clean way of setting up test case., Thanks [~sunilg] for the review! Added 002 patch to pass in NO_LABEL instead of null. Not sure if this was the cleanup in test case setup that you were referring to., Yes. Thanks [~jhung].
I will wait for [~naganarasimha_gr@apache.org] as well., Thanks [~sunilg] for the reviews and [~jhung] for working on it.
+1 LGTM, patch can be committed., I just committed this to branch-2.7. Thank you [~jhung]., Great, thanks [~shv] for commit and [~Naganarasimha]/[~sunilg] for reviews!]
