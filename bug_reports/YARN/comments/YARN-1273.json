This message is automatically generated., [~vinodkv] Mind taking a look? Thanks., Yup. The patch looks fine. I think we can easily write a test by directly using ApplicationMaster and intercepting NM Client. Basically initialize ApplicationMaster,  add a new protected method for creating NMCallbackHandler, intercept onStartContainerSuccess and call back onStartContainerError. Let me know if that works., Modified with a test. Test required quite a bit more changes., Minor tweak to log progress., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
