[Hi, [~bibinchundatt], I think the reason is "These properties are looked up in the yarn-site.xml"., Hi [~ywskycn] , Thank you for looking in to the issue.
All the fair scheduler properties we mention in yarn-site only except queue level configuration. (About 13 properties)
Reference :http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/FairScheduler.html
Except the mentioned properties all of them follow the same prefix pattern specific to fair. So i feel we should sync these two properties also.
