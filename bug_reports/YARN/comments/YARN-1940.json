This message is automatically generated., Thanks for posting a patch, Rushabh.  The patch will cause us to continue trying to delete, but it will not report the failure to delete one or more files.  We need to return a non-zero return code from delete_path if we failed to delete an entry, with the caveat that we shouldn't complain about an attempt to delete a non-existent path.  I'm thinking patterning it more like the logic in delete_as_user would make sense, where we remember if there was an error and will ultimately return an error, but we don't stop trying to delete on the first error.  delete_as_user reports the last error it received rather than the first, but it conveys the general idea., Thanks Jason for your comments.
