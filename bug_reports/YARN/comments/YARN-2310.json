[YARN-1867 has added queue ACL checks, and hasAccess is already invoked by getApp and getApps api's. If queue ACL access is available, then information of an application such as *start/finished/elapsed time* and *AM container information* will be filled in to AppInfo object.
Do you mean some more extra information is taken from customized yarn filter added in YARN-2247, could you please help to give some more insight., Thanks for notifying me of that. Would you please check the other app-related getter methods? For example, getAppAttempts. It seems that we can access without any access control., Yes. getAppAttempts and getAppState could also fall in to this ACL check. Only problem is, *getAppAttempts* does not have "HttpServletRequest hsr Context". 
{code}  public AppAttemptsInfo getAppAttempts(@PathParam("appid") String appId){code}
Hence getting UGI information without HttpServletRequest  is not possible for getAppAttempts api.]
