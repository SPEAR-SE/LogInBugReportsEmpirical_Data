This message was automatically generated., Hi [~zxu], 
     Trying for understanding the problem, Is it ocured when the RM shutdown is called which tries to stop FS service? Does it causing RM to hang during shutdown?, Hi [~rohithsharma], thanks for the review.
The ContinuousSchedulingThread is a daemon thread, it won't cause the RM to hang during shutdown.
I may cause issue for the test when it tries to stop the scheduler., \\

This message was automatically generated., The patch itself looks good. Can we add a unittest to catch any regressions here? For instance, in the future, AsyncDispatcher might stop wrapping InterruptedException in a YarnRuntimeException. , Hi [~kasha], thanks for the review! That is a good suggestion, I attached a new patch YARN-3697.001.patch which addressed your comments with two tests. Please review it. thanks again!, +1, \\
