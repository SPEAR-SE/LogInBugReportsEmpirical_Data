[In patch #1 I added Log Aggregation Status to the Logs tab. 

However, the old UI offers more than that, on \{rm}:8088/cluster/logaggregationstatus/\{app_id} it shows a table with all the affected nodes, their log aggregations statuses and diagnostic messages. In order to present the same on the new UI we need to add this information to the RM Web Services by creating a new API endpoint. [~yeshavora] Can I open a separate ticket for that?

 , yes sure. Thanks for picking up this Jira., Created [YARN-7881|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-7881]., [~GergelyNovak] Change looks fine to me.

One dbt, when log aggregation is yet to start, we ll show the status without any style, correct?, We show it with the default style (grey). , Cool. Looks fine to me. I ll commit this later today., Thanks [~GergelyNovak]., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #13617 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/13617/])
