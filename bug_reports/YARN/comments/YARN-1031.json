, Reopening and reverting this, as I missed the fact that we aren't including the images that correspond to the CSS.  As a result none of the jquery icons are appearing on the UI pages after this change.

[~jeagles] can you refresh the patch to include the appropriate image files?, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #775 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/775/])

Patch needs to be applied with git apply, and Jenkins doesn't know how to deal with patches against anything but trunk.
