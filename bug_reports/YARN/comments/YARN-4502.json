[Thanks for [~yeshavora] reported this issue.

Looked at this issue with [~jianhe]/[~vinodkv], root cause of this problem is:
- After YARN-3535, all containers transition from ALLOCATED to KILLED state will be re-added to scheduler. And such resource request will be added to *current* scheduler application attempt.
- If some containers are in ALLOCATED state and AM crashes, resource requests of these containers could be added to *new* scheduler application attempt.
- When the new application attempt request AM container, it calls
{code}
        // AM resource has been checked when submission
        Allocation amContainerAllocation =
            appAttempt.scheduler.allocate(appAttempt.applicationAttemptId,
                Collections.singletonList(appAttempt.amReq),
                EMPTY_CONTAINER_RELEASE_LIST, null, null);
        if (amContainerAllocation != null
            && amContainerAllocation.getContainers() != null) {
          assert (amContainerAllocation.getContainers().size() == 0);
        }
{code}
Some containers could be allocated of this scheduler.allocate call, these container will be ignored because the following *assert* is not enabled in production environment.
- So this results to some container could be possibly leaked when we allocating retried AM containers.

*Possible fixes*:
1) Release all allocated container of {{amContainerAllocation.getContainers()}}
OR
2) Instead of using {{getCurrentAttemptForContainer}} in {{AbstractYarnScheduler#recoverResourceRequestForContainer}}, we should only recover ResourceRequest to the attempt which includes the container., [~leftnoteasy], I started writing a test for this assuming the previous hypothesis, and it doesn't add up.
bq. After YARN-3535, all containers transition from ALLOCATED to KILLED state will be re-added to scheduler. And such resource request will be added to current scheduler application attempt.
Two cases here
 # If the container (in allocated state) got killed before the AM crash, it will get added to the app-attempt #1, so this bug won't happen
 # An allocated container simply doesn't survive AM crash (both when keepContainerAcrossApplicationAttempt is on and off) - scheduler itself kills all allocated containers right after AM crashes as part of {{doneApplicationAtttempt()}}. And these killed containers also get added to the app-attempt #1 because current-app-attempt is not switched till {{addApplicationAttempt()}} comes in for the new app-attempt.

So, it doesn't look like our previous analysis is right. /cc [~jianhe]

[~yeshavora], do you have the RM logs?, Hi [~vinodkv],

My understanding this could happen when:
- CS calls doneApplicationAttempt
- Which causes Containers are killed when they're at allocated state
- ContainerRescheduledEvent added to event queue
{code}
  private static final class ContainerRescheduledTransition extends
      FinishedTransition {

    @Override
    public void transition(RMContainerImpl container, RMContainerEvent event) {
      // Tell scheduler to recover request of this container to app
      container.eventHandler.handle(new ContainerRescheduledEvent(container));
      super.transition(container, event);
    }
  }
{code}
- If add-application-attempt-event sent to scheduler before container-rescheduled-event arrives, application attempt will be replaced so resource request will be restored to next attempt.

Thoughts?, bq. If add-application-attempt-event sent to scheduler before container-rescheduled-event arrives, application attempt will be replaced so resource request will be restored to next attempt.
Seemed like a wild theory on first look, but it isn't and you are right! Because the current flow is {{ContainerRescheduledTransition -> RM level event handler + queue -> Scheduler event handler + queue}}, it is actually very likely for this to happen.

Once we remove this flow and let scheduler do the {{kill-container + recover-requests}} in one shot, none of the routing-to-the wrong attempt will happen anymore.

Let me take a crack at this, assigning this to myself.

Side issue discovered: While the app-attempt finish is in the process of saving to state-store, the scheduler can happily go around allocating more and more containers for the (finishing) app-attempt!, Here's a patch fixing this.

The core fix is relatively concentrated. We now perform kill-container and recover-requests in one shot without all the events (which was broken anyways). 

Much of the remaining changes are for test-cases and a bit of renames and refactors.

Summary of the changes:

 - AbstractYarnScheduler: Renamed existing completedContainer() method to be {{completedContainerInternal()}} and added a new {{completedContainer()}} which wraps around completedContainerInternal(), does common null-checks and also recovers ResourceRequests as needed
 - SchedulerEventType.KILL_CONTAINER ->SchedulerEventType.KILL_PREEMPTED_CONTAINER and DROP_RESERVATION -> KILL_RESERVED_CONTAINER
 - Got rid of ContainerRescheduledTransition completely. No need for container to send an event to the scheduler. Once this is removed, got rid of ContainerRescheduledEvent too.
 - Moved ContainerPreemptEvent from org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler package into org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.event. That is where it belongs.
 - PreemptableResourceScheduler: Renamed APIs dropContainerReservation -> killReservedContainer and killContainer -> killPreemptedContainer
 - FiCaSchedulerApp.addPreemptContainer -> preemptContainer, Actually I think the refactor I did seems like the original aim of YARN-2143., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~vinodkv], patch looks very good to me, only one minor comment:

Do you think is it better to rename PREEMPT_CONTAINER/preemptContainer in CapacityScheduler to something like add_preemption_candidate or mark-container-for-preemption? Preempt-container looks very similar to kill-preempted-container. Similarily, FiCaSchedulerApp#preemptContainer.
, Tx for the review, [~leftnoteasy]

bq. Do you think is it better to rename PREEMPT_CONTAINER/preemptContainer in CapacityScheduler to something like add_preemption_candidate or mark-container-for-preemption? Preempt-container looks very similar to kill-preempted-container. Similarily, FiCaSchedulerApp#preemptContainer.
Makes sense, that is what I was thinking before too but didn't make the change.

Uploading a new patch with that comment addressed. Also fixed whitespace and checkstyle issue. Cannot address the too-long-file warning., Both the tests failed on a host-name related problem on unrelated test-cases  TestAMAuthorization and TestClientRMTokens both of which pass for me.

Submitting updated patch., Looks good to me, +1. Pending Jenkins., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Committed to trunk/branch-2, thanks [~vinodkv] and analysis from [~yeshavora]/[~jianhe].

Trying to committed to branch-2.8 but it has some conflicts, I would prefer to commit YARN-4524 to branch-2.8 first to resolve conflicts. YARN-4524 is a cleanup patch and it looks safe to me. We can have a cleaner code base and avoid some future merge conflicts with it.

Thoughts? [~kasha]/[~vinodkv]., I tried backporting YARN-4524 to branch-2.8. Unfortunately, branch-2.8 compilation is broken. 

[~leftnoteasy] - mind cherry-picking it to 2.8 once the compilation is fixed. , [~kasha],

Thanks for reply,

, branch-2/branch-2.8 was broken by YARN-4265, uploaded addendum patch and committed it. 
Most probably, guessing in your case that compilation is done for trunk first where in 3.0.0.SNAPSHOT jar has got published to local repository. And later trying to compile in branch-2/branch-2.8 fetches jars from local repository., [~leftnoteasy], looks like you committed the wrong patch, likely because of the wrong names I gave to the patch. You should look at YARN-4502-20160114.txt as the final patch.

I'll let you fix this as there seem to be other things you did on other branches, reopening it for now., Thanks [~vinodkv], just reverted & committed it to branch-2/2.8/trunk., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #9134 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/9134/])

, Since YARN-3535 gone in 2.7.2 and 2.6.4, should this JIRA need to be back ported to branch-2.7 and branch-2.6? 
Any thoughts?, +1 on backport to maintenance branches. , +1 also. This patch also covers the case when a container receives RMContainerEventType.EXPIRE event at state RMContainerState.ALLOCATED, which was not covered by YARN-3535.
Based on the original suggestion by [~leftnoteasy], It looks like the implementation for {{AbstractYarnScheduler#getApplicationAttempt(ApplicationAttemptId applicationAttemptId)}} is also confusing. It always returns the current application attempt even the current application attempt doesn't match the given {{applicationAttemptId}}.
In contrast, {{RMAppImpl#getRMAppAttempt(ApplicationAttemptId appAttemptId)}} always returns the matched {{RMAppAttempt}}.
Should we fix it in a follow-up JIRA?, Nice catch, [~zxu]! Given SchedulerApplication only stores current attempt (and only current attempt matters), may be we can just simply rename {{getApplicationAttempt()}} to {{getApplicationCurrentAttempt()}}?
Try to cherry-pick the patch to branch-2.6 but involve many conflicts. Will defer it to 2.6.5 given 2.6.4 should be shortly out., [~zxu] / [~djp]
bq. It looks like the implementation for AbstractYarnScheduler#getApplicationAttempt(ApplicationAttemptId applicationAttemptId) is also confusing.
This is by design - see YARN-1041 - we want to route all the events destined for AppAttempt *only* to the current attempt. We should just document this and move on.]
