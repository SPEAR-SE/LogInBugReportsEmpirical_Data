This message is automatically generated., Agree with moving the verbose access logging into debug level. Maybe also have some place just print a single logging about the accessing user in INFO level, which is good for debugging.? , Since WebAppProxyServlet.doGet() is called for every fetch data, it is very hard to print accessing user only single time. :-( , I don't see in 2.6 rc, this problem is occurring. No idea which Jira made to fix this issue but I see code that log message is still INFO only. I think optimization might be done in some other layer which fixed this.
This issue can be closed if necessary by mentioning issue fixed Jira id., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
