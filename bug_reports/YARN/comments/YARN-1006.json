[THe old NM information issue isn't really a bug. Today NMs start on ephemeral ports so RM see the restarted NM as a new NM. The old NM will eventually be removed after timeout., The reason why the page is not showing in correct format/style is because at YARN-686, we flattened the nodeReport, deleted Health-status from the nodeReport, but we did not update the column index at the nodesTableInit function. 
After update the column index, we should fix the issue.  , Trivial patch. No tests added, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
