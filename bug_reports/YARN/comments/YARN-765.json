[I've not seen this happen in Hadoop, but have encountered it in other DFSs, where the FS server's clock was 100% in sync with the others via NTP, but its time zone was in GMT, not PST. Result: premature loss of data.

this is precisely why {{ant -diagnostics}} includes an FS offset test -bad time in the FS can confuse a lot of dependency logic.
