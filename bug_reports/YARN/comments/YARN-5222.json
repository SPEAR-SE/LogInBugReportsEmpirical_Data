 - Please do not delete patches from JIRA - if you want to upload a new one, version it and post it.
 - If you want to post an update, simply "cancel the patch".
 - Please don't set the flags "Incompatible change, Reviewed". A committer sets them as part of commit -time.

Also removing 2.7.3 (which is close to a release) from target-version till we know the actual fix and till we have a patch that is commitable., Also, please don't set fix version field as we don't have any patch get committed.]
