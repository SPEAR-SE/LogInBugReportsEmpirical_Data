Manual steps  to verify this patch:
1. Configure RM to use FairScheduler
2. Go to the scheduler page in RM
3. Click any queue to display the detailed info
4. Without this patch, the fair share entry does not display info 
5. With this patch, the fair share entry shows memory and vcore info , I just committed this.  THanks [~liangly]!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4693 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4693/])
