[The test is failing because yarn-default.xml has yarn.router.clientrm.cache-max-size but that doesn't appear in YarnConfiguration.  Looks like this was a botched cherry-pick from YARN-5413 into branch-2.  The original commit in trunk or the YARN-2915 branch changed yarn.router.clientrm.cache-max-size to yarn.router.pipeline.cache-max-size in both YarnConfiguration and yarn-default, but the yarn-default change was lost when ported to branch-2.
, Attaching a patch that fixes the missed rename in yarn-default.xml along with the new property description.  Pinging [~giovanni.fumarola] and [~subru] to review and see if there are other things that were missed as part of the merge to branch-2., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~jlowe] for taking care of it. I just checked the yarn-default.xml and that one was the only missing.
I am double checking all the other files we edited during the merging to branch-2. I will open new jira(s) for any missing part(s)., bq. The test is failing because yarn-default.xml has yarn.router.clientrm.cache-max-size but that doesn't appear in YarnConfiguration
thanks [~jlowe] for the investigation. As part of test improvement, I think it would be a good to print all missing configurations in assert message. When I checked assert message, I could not able to find which configurations are missing! , bq. As part of test improvement, I think it would be a good to print all missing configurations in assert message.

That sounds good, but that should be a separate JIRA from this one.  This JIRA is not intended to go to trunk just branch-2, and any test improvement would go to trunk as well., Just as an FYI, when you run the test, maven does point you at the surefire-reports directory (as does the dev-support/verify-xml.sh script).  You can look at the resulting org.apache.hadoop.yarn.conf.TestYarnConfigurationFields-output.txt file for the full output of the unit tests., +1 for patch! Jenkins didn't run because of findbug download and tar extraction failed. I have triggered manually to run again., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
