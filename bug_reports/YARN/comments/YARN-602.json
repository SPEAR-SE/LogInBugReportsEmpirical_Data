[In Yarn-561, NM mandatorily set Container_Id, NM_PORT, NM_HTTP_PORT, NM_HOST and LOCAL_DIRS. There should be more Environment variables that need to be enforced by NM, Changed to put environment variables forcelly in sanitizeEnv. But I couldn't set system environment HADOOP_CONF_DIR in test (Mockito doesn't support?), so I left it. Sorry if I misunderstand it., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~kj-ki], the patch looks good overall but it isn't applying against latest trunk. Can you please update?

Also, in the test, you are writing the values for the envs only in non-windows case. Because of this the test will fail on Windows. Can you also write the values in Windows case too? Tx., [~kj-ki] Can you please update?, Sorry, late for update and windows case error. I have only Linux and OS X environment.
How can I fix putting env in windows case? Is it elevant to Environment.USER(USERNAME in Windows)?, bq.  How can I fix putting env in windows case? Is it elevant to Environment.USER(USERNAME in Windows)?
That's correct. Environment.USER automatically resolves correctly depending on the OS., Thanks for answering.
Updated for latest trunk and changed to use Environment.USER.key() where putting user env for windows case., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good. It needs a minor update w.r.t the test-case as PWD doesn't always need to be the first dir. Fixing this myself., Same patch as Kenji's, with the test-fix.

Will commit it when Jenkins says okay.., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
