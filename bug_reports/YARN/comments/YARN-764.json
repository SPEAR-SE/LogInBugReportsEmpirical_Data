This message is automatically generated., Nemon, thanks for looking at this.  I guess its because it uses the raw "<" character instead of "&lt". 

Another option, which I would prefer, is just to escape the string using StringEscapeUtils.escapeHtml() in CapacitySchedulerPage.java.  That way if someone adds something else to the string in the future or it accidentally gets changed back it will still work., Changing patch as Thomas suggested,escape HTML is a better way definitely, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
