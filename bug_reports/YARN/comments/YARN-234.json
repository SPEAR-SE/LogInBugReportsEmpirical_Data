[With the attached patch, I have verified that WindowsResourceCalculatorPlugin/WindowsBasedProcessTree are in effect in a single-node YARN cluster on a Windows VM.  I also have verified that the unit tests like TestProcfsBasedProcessTree still pass on Linux., nuke getProcResourceValues, process tree should be use instead., remove it because its not used anywhere and no need to add another field to RC plugin., Also i have YARN-223 to change interface a bit, its minor change. So wait until its committed., Looks like a clean port from branch-1-win. +1. Thanks!

If we havent already done so, would be great to check that process tree and resources are being correctly calculated on Windows.

, Linking to YARN-223 to show that we'd like YARN-223 committed before YARN-234., Thanks, Bikas.  I just tested again and checked the resource calculations.  They appear to be valid for my test setup., I just committed this. Thanks Chris!]
