    [YARN-6478] Fix a spelling mistake

, Hi [~Naganarasimha], I have attach a patch. Can you take a review?, [~lingjinjiang], I understand that we need to start from some where for contribution, but this is too trivial and nearly unused code. And raising multiple issues for spelling checks(may be not all by a single person) is not advisable, what you could do is collect multiple such issues under a class/package/project and raise one!
Adding you to the contributor's list anyway.
