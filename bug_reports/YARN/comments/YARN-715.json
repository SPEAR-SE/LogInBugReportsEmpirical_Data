[Is this a duplicate of YARN-699?, [~sseth] Given the tests are timing out instead of failing, is there another underlying problem that the unauthorized access did not get reported back to the AM via either the NM or RM such the app hung? , Seems like a bug in DSShell that does not handle failed container launches properly., {quote}

Perhaps it's related to this comment on YARN-417:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-417?focusedCommentId=13609801&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13609801

Prior to YARN-417, ApplicationMaster would check for being done at a regular interval. Now, using the AMRMClientAsync, it only checks on container completion, which never occurs because no containers are run.

Perhaps because of only checking on container completion, if no container ever completes successfully, then the AM never knows to exit, and the process appears to hang., TestUnmanagedAMLauncher was not timing out for me, from a bit of debugging I am relatively sure it started failing after YARN-617. , Correction to my above comment: -TestUnmanagedAMLauncher was not timing out for me,- from a bit of debugging I am relatively sure TestUnmanagedAMLauncher started failing after YARN-617., Let me try to fix this.., This should fix it.
