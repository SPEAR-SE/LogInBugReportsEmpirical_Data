[This JIRA can be my good start of first patch for YARN. 
[~yzhangal] Would you mind assigning this JIRA for me, since I don't have the privilege to assign YARN JIRA to myself., Sure [~yuanbo], seems someone need to help to add your name to YARN contributer list before your name can be assigned to (I tried and could not).
, upload v1 patch for this JIRA., Patch looks good to me.  +1, [~templedf] Thanks for your review., Thanks for the patch, [~yuanbo], and, [~yzhangal], for filing the issue.  Committed to trunk and branch-2.  Congrats on your first commit, [~yuanbo]!, FAILURE: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11096 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11096/])
