[Jon, I think you meant to say "the RM will create a shared secret"

Note that this feature will also catch the dev-time situation where, if your test code is running on the same host as the RM, you can talk direct to the AM without being 302'd to the proxy. That is, it enforces the same HTTP proxy chain in standalone & minicluster as in production, Correct - should be RM.  Edited and fixed.]
