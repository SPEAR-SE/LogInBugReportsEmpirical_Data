[This NPE is introduced by YARN-4983.  UgiMetrics will not be initialized in UGI class, unless there is external code that calls:
{code:java}
UserGroupInformation.reattachMetrics();{code}
There is a possibility that other new process encounter the same NPE in Kerberos enabled environment.  It would be great if the reattachMetrics call can be initialized by itself without external invocation., This is solved upstream in HADOOP-15593.]
