[Attaching a patch., Another way to do this patch would be to change the {{Before}} method so that the first line is:

{code}
org.junit.Assume.assumeTrue(!Shell.WINDOWS);
{code}

This would be a smaller patch, and it also would automatically cover skipping any new tests added to this suite when running on Windows.
, Thanks for the suggestion, Chris! Attaching a new patch., Actually, I was thinking we could put the {{assumeTrue}} call inside the {{Before}} method.  This way, it's a very small patch.  It also helps ease maintenance, because when people add new tests to this suite, they won't need to remember to call {{assumeTrue}}.

I apologize if I'm not communicating this clearly.  I'm attaching a patch that shows it.  Sometimes code is easier.  :-)
