Only application belongs to user or if the user has admin ACL for queue he will be able to move the application.
Also target queue should have acl for user. Addition flag to disable required??, [~bibinchundatt] I am also thinking on similar lines. It also checks whether user has permission to submit in the target queue. So, IMO we shouldn't require another flag to disable it as we are already checking for all the permissions.

 

[~saruntek] could you please tell the use case that you wanted to target., [~abmodi] 

Use Case: There are around ~200 + application developers who submit the jobs to this cluster. Majority of these jobs are submitted as batch users, which is why we want to disable the feature of move queue on cluster level instead of disabling for few users. Maybe something like a flag on cluster level.
{code:java}
move_to_queue=false{code}
Please let me know if this explains the use case. cc [~wangda]]
