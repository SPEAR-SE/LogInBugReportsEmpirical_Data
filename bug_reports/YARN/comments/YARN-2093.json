[Thanks for reporting this Jon.

Did this occur in an RM-HA setup?

Is it reproducible?, RM-HA is enabled. This only happened on the first start after upgrading from 2.2.0. Starting the RM again after the first start works without error. I haven't tried to do an upgrade again, so I'm not sure if it's reproducible.

, When upgrading a second time from 2.2.0 to 2.4.1-rc1, this didn't happen. So, this is not reproducible as far as I can tell., This looks like a duplicate of YARN-5136.
I will provide a fix for this through that new jira.]
