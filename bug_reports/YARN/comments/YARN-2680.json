[[~djp] could you elaborate more on the use-case?  During NM restart the RM is unaware that the NM is being restarted because it's normally only down for a few seconds.  If the RM was aware of the node being down then that could easily cause some undesired chaos (e.g.: RM informs AM of lost/removed node, AM decides to kill container and start a new one, etc.)., Hi [~jlowe], I think I meant that Node shouldn't be listed as running when recovery work is disabled. Correct the title here and found an existing JIRA there: YARN-41. Will mark this as duplicated.]
