[Sorry about this Sandy! I dug and guess that it was broken probably because appTableInit() was indiscriminately initing the dataTable with "aaData: appsTableData" even when no such array existed (for instance in the fair scheduler page) Thanks a lot for fixing it.

Patch looks good to me +1., Not a problem - the fair scheduler page has a custom AppsBlock so that it can include info on each app's fair share, so the fix was just bringing it in line with the changes made to AppsBlock.
