, Thanks for the patch, Colin!

I noticed we're using openat, fchmodat, and unlinkat for the first time.  I suspect most other POSIX-like distributions support this, but I think these were only recently added to MacOS X (in 10.9 Yosemite).  I'm not sure if anyone uses container-executor for MacOS X (or if container-executor even compiles/works for MacOS X today). but adding these could break the native build for those using older MacOS X versions.  One alternative would be a double-pass with ftw where we walk just the directories first changing permissions then followed by the walk it does today.  The directory trees involved are going to be very shallow, so it's probably not a problem in practice if we decided to go that route.

If we stick with the custom walker then here are some comments on the patch:
* I think this needs to use strerror(-fd):
{code}
  if (fd < 0) {
    fprintf(LOGFILE, "error opening %s: %s\n", name, strerror(ret));
    goto done;
  }
{code}
* There's no check for an error being encountered by readdir and therefore no logging if it does occur
* Sometimes recursive_unlink_helper is returning errno and sometimes it is returning -errno.  For example, the "failed to stat" path will set ret=errno and return -ret as -errno, but the "failed to unlink" path will set ret=-errno and thus return errno.

, Thanks for the review, [~jlowe].

Hmm.  Correct me if I'm wrong, but I don't think {{container-executor}} is supported at all on MacOS.  I can see places in the code that rely on cgroups, which is a kernel feature that MacOS just doesn't have (and may never have).  You can see a bunch of code in {{container-executor.c}} dealing with very linux specific files in {{/proc}}, and so forth.  My thinking is that if we ever do support MacOS in {{container-executor}}, we will support a new enough version that using the newer POSIX functions is not a problem.

Good catch.  Let's return positive error codes everywhere, except in the very specific case of {{open_helper}} where non-negative returns mean "file descriptor"., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for updating the patch!

bq. I can see places in the code that rely on cgroups, which is a kernel feature that MacOS just doesn't have (and may never have).

Yeah, it cannot work in practice on MacOS from this and other stuff in there.  Sorry I should have noticed that.  I suppose there's a chance it happens to compile in case someone is doing a native build on MacOS X, but arguably we should just have those builds skip container-executor if they already aren't doing so.

Comments on the latest patch:

The unit test fails, probably because we now deference NULL instead of terminating the loop in this code.  When readdir returns NULL and there's no error, the code will try to dereference a null de.
{code}
    while (1) {
      struct dirent *de;
      char *new_fullpath = NULL;
      
      errno = 0;
      de = readdir(dfd);
      if (!de) {
        ret = errno;
        if (ret) {
          fprintf(LOGFILE, "readdir(%s) failed: %s\n", name, strerror(ret));
          goto done;
        }
      }
      if (!strcmp(de->d_name, ".")) {
{code}

The code can end up returning success despite an allocation failure because it doesn't initialize {{ret}} in this error case:
{code}
      if (asprintf(&new_fullpath, "%s/%s", fullpath, de->d_name) < 0) {
        fprintf(LOGFILE, "Failed to allocate string for %s/%s.\n",
                fullpath, de->d_name); 
        goto done;
      }
{code}

recursive_unlink_helper and recursive_unlink_children now returns normal error codes, but this is still expecting negative codes:
{code}
  ret = recursive_unlink_children(full_path);
  if (ret == -ENOENT) {
    return 0;
  }
{code}

This code would be simpler to read if it didn't negate the error when trying to deal with it:
{code}
  if (rmdir(full_path) != 0) {
    ret = -errno;
    if (ret != -ENOENT) {
      fprintf(LOGFILE, "Couldn't delete directory %s - %s\n",
              full_path, strerror(-ret));
      return -1;
    }
  }
{code}
, Thanks for the careful review, [~jlowe].

Ah, sorry.  There is a missing {{break}}, let me fix that.

bq. The code can end up returning success despite an allocation failure because it doesn't initialize ret in this error case:

Good catch.  {{ret}} is initialized at the top of the function to prevent undefined behavior, but it should be changed to {{ENOMEM}} there to reflect the memory allocation failure.

, Thanks for updating the patch!  There's just a couple of remaining bugs, both related to remnants from when error codes were negated:
{code}
  ret = recursive_unlink_children(full_path);
  if (ret == ENOENT) {
    return 0;
  }
  if (ret != 0) {
    fprintf(LOGFILE, "Error while deleting %s: %d (%s)\n",
            full_path, -ret, strerror(-ret));
{code}
It's negating ret when it shouldn't at the fprintf call.  Same thing for the following instance:
{code}
  if (rmdir(full_path) != 0) {
    ret = errno;
    if (ret != ENOENT) {
      fprintf(LOGFILE, "Couldn't delete directory %s - %s\n",
              full_path, strerror(-ret));
{code}

It would also be nice to cleanup the whitespace nits, although it's no trouble cleaning those up as part of the commit., Sigh.  The negation is a really hard habit to break... it's the pattern for how errors are handled in the kernel.  This should fix it.

I also changed it to use "fullpath" when printing error messages, to make it easier to figure out which file had a problem.

Fixed the whitespace nits as well.

, Thanks, [~jlowe]., This patch broke compilation on Mac OS X 10.9, where the SDK does not include a definition of {{AT_REMOVEDIR}} in fcntl.h or unistd.h.  If you have the 10.10 SDK installed, then the header does have {{AT_REMOVEDIR}}.  (See /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer/Platforms/MacOSX.platform/Developer/SDKs/MacOSX10.10.sdk/usr/include/sys/fcntl.h).  I haven't yet figured out if there is an easy way Mac users can set it to cross-compile with the 10.10 SDK as a workaround.  For now, I'm just going to have to skip this part of the build on Mac., I think this application doesn't work on Mac anyway, since it is using cgroups stuff which Mac won't have.  So skipping should be completely fine., I don't actually run it on Mac.  The impact though is that I can no longer do a full distro build of the source tree with {{-Pnative}}.  libhadoop.dylib is at least partially functional., Sorry for any inconvenience, [~cnauroth].  Unfortunately, I don't own or have access to a Mac.  As far as I know, INFRA doesn't have a license to run MacOS in a virtual machine, so we can't do precommit testing on the existing infrastructure.  If you post a patch to skip compilation on Mac I will review it., [~cmccabe], no worries, and no finger pointing intended.  I only meant to document what I had found here in case other Mac users stumble on the same issue.

FWIW, I'd prefer not to patch the Hadoop source at all and instead find some external way to target the 10.10 SDK, where the constant is defined., It would be nice to have the ability to target a specific Mac OS X SDK version in general.  However I agree with Colin that it doesn't really make sense to have the Mac build compiling a program that's never intended to run on the Mac in the first place.  It may happen to compile by chance, but we don't want to get into a situation where we keep accidentally breaking it as happened here.  Therefore I think the real long-term fix is to patch the Hadoop build to avoid compiling container-executor on the Mac.
, bq.  As far as I know, INFRA doesn't have a license to run MacOS in a virtual machine, so we can't do precommit testing on the existing infrastructure.

Fixed.
