[It would also be nice to make the Last-Health-Update time human readable., I guess Thomas you mean instead of "Last-Last-Health-Update" it should be "Last-Node-Status" with a human readable date format ?
Please clarify.
I have looked into the issue and will be patching if after the update from you.

Thanks & Regards
Abhishek, Also I am proposing to use DateFormat.LONG which will be for example (26 February, 2013 11:51:35 AM IST), Yeah I meant instead of "Last-Last-Health-Update" it should just be "Last-Health-Update" and in human readable date format. I'll fix the title., Abhishek, I already have a patch for this, I am taking this over., It has fixed the "Last-Last-Health-Update" issue and is also formatting the date. "yyyy-MM-dd'T'HH:mm:ssZZ" format is used for date. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., "mvn eclipse:eclipse" works locally with patch. Trying to submit the patch again., Looked at the patch. One comment:
 - When I tried to print the output by modifying the test itself, it says "Last-Health-Update : 1969-12-31T16:00:00-08:00", not sure if you are seeing the extraneous T character or not. Please verify. If it is indeed like that, we will need to fix it., Yes .. T was for timezone.(-08:00 for PST). I am making output more readable., Changing the format string to "E dd/MMM/yy hh:mm:ss:SSzz". Making it more readable., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
