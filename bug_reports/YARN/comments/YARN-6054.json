[Thanks to Jason's pointer for repairing the LevelDb [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2873?focusedCommentId=14216259&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14216259], when we tried to "repair" the levelDb, the TS came up just fine., Here's a patch along with a unit test., Thanks [~raviprak] for the patch! One quick concern is what will happen if the repair fails. IIUC we're repairing every time there are IOEs, will this cause any false alarms and/or accidentally make things worse? Thanks! , Hi Li Lu! Thanks for your review!
As you can see, I am trying to repair only once (in the catch block) when the service is inited. If the repair (or the subsequent open) fails and throws an IOException then we will again crash out and fail to start the TimelineServer. According to Jason's comment, and I agree, at that point we can't really do anything (maybe operations personnel would need to delete the entire database). , Thanks [~raviprak], fail the second attempt sounds like a right choice. I'm not very familiar with the repair method for leveldb jni, but would just like to verify that even though a repair fails, the data corruption will not be in a worsened form. We would like to avoid the case where the data was recoverable by some approaches (other than repair) but becomes not recoverable after a repair. Is this possible? Thanks! , Thanks Li Lu! I agree with you. A repair operation definitely changes the LevelDb files. In this patch I am creating a backup of the corrupted database. I am consciously neglecting to do cleanup of old backups because I don't expect this to occur too often. If we want automatic cleanup of old backups I propose we punt that to another JIRA., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, The test failure is not related and seems to already have been reported in YARN-5934 , Thanks [~raviprakashu] for the patch, overall patch looks fine technically, but has it been tested in in the actual scenario ? Assuming that you had encountered this and tried this option, i am asking it. Also in the test we are just ensuring that the api is just called, so if it has been tried and useful at least once then ok.
Some points :
# Additionally we are using LevelDb in multiple other places like NM state store etc, would it be good to handle in these places too as part of this jira itself ?
# we are trying to backup the files hope test case could verify that scenario too.
# {{setTestFactory}} can be annotated with VisibleForTesting and the name can be just {{setFactory}} 

, Thanks Naganarasimha for your careful review! As I posted in the first comment, the repair did indeed fix the issue for us (we had a production incident.) As I'm sure you'll understand, we can't post the leveldb files in the open source.
# I feel this JIRA is very specific to the TimelineServer so I am hesitant to include other daemons. Also, as pointed out by Jason, (e.g. in the case of NM) graceful degradation would be a very hard thing to achieve. More likely, the state is corrupt and will cause undefined behavior.
# Fair point. Will do.
# Great idea. Will do., Here's a patch with the improvements suggested by Naganarasimha., Thanks for the patch [~raviprakashu], 
bq. Also, as pointed out by Jason, (e.g. in the case of NM) graceful degradation would be a very hard thing to achieve. More likely, the state is corrupt and will cause undefined behavior.
Agree, but may be we can give some kind of tool and set of steps which can be taken to over come it as we too faced it once.  but agree its not within this jira's scope !
Changes look good enough will wait for the jenkins report and if no further comments will commit it tomorrow !, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, thanks for the contribution [~raviprakashu] and additional reviews from [~gtCarrera9]. Committed to trunk and branch-2., FAILURE: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11099 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11099/])
YARN-6054. TimelineServer fails to start when some LevelDb state files (naganarasimha_gr: rev 4c431a694059e40e78365b02a1497a6c7e479a70)

, Oops sorry [~Naganarasimha] I was trying to take a closer look at the updated patch, but never mind... Also, is the UT failure traced somewhere else? , Ohh sorry, wasn't sure you were looking into it. May be next time will try to give lil more time. 
YARN-5934 was tracking the failed test case also missed to mention the same though i observed it !, Thanks Naganarasimha!

Thanks for looking Li Lu! Please feel free to comment if you find anything and we'll get it in., Thanks [~raviprak]. The committed patch LGTM. Once the old file is backed up we don't need to worry if the repair process would make things worse. , We actually hit this problem recently. Bump up to Critical as the failure will hang entire ATS server.
Hi [~raviprak] and [~gtCarrera9], shall we consider to backport this fix to 2.8.2?, Sure Junping! I took the liberty of cherry-picking the change into branch-2.8 and branch-2.8.2 after running the unit test. Internally at my company we have backported this already and were running without problems because of this issue with Hadoop-2.7.3. Thanks for the suggestion of merging into 2.8.2]
