This message is automatically generated., bq. +          nodeStatusUpdater.getNodeStatusAndUpdateContainersInContext();
why is this required?

you might need to rebase patch based on YARN-617

testNodeStatusUpdaterRetryAndNMShutdown - startContainer code might change after above patch.

, bq.  nodeStatusUpdater.getNodeStatusAndUpdateContainersInContext();
this is required, since this method is removing the completed containers from the context

Will rebase later., patch for 2.0.5-alpha for YARN-864, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Mostly looks fine. One comment, the test-case isn't running as expected. On my machine, though we expect the container to be long running, it crashes. So we aren't verifying the correct thing. I was trying to make the test fail without code changes. which is when I ran into this. Can you take a look?, Updated the test, the test will fail without NM changes and pass with changes., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
