[I've attached a patch in which I delete the default values in yarn-default and mapred-default, since I can't think of a way to encode the dynamic behavior here (these values are in the code so deleting them causes the right thing to happen). The patch also has a fix for the MRJobConfig code to use the correct default based on platform., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
