[Thanks for your interest in contributing. 

I have added you as contributor and assigned the Jira to you., I believe this behaviour is made intentionally in jira YARN-1074 to list applications for submitted,accepted and running state using {{yarn application -list}}. The main purpose is users are interested in seeing all their outstanding applications by default.
[~xgong] Please give your opinion, As far as i opine at the very first view when a user goes for " yarn application -list " command he will expect all the applications to be listed. Moreover the description of list command doesn't  specify it.

Also we have option to filter out from the list, so on a view level we are trying to filter out the objects from a list  that are not present there., I agree with Rohit. I think we do this intentionally because hundreds or thousands of applications could be listed if include completed or killed ones but users are typically more interest on "actively" ones. User can use "--appStatus" if they want to list finished applications. , bq. The main purpose is users are interested in seeing all their outstanding applications by default.

Yes, this is reason., +1 for not listing all the old stuff. It becomes a long list, fast. , I think that this consensus is that this is working as we would want it to.  Any objection to resolving as such?, [~anushri] I'm going to go ahead and resolve this as the consensus appears to be that the behavior is best as it is.  If you feel strongly otherwise feel free to reopen and explain.]
