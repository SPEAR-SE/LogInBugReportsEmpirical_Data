This message is automatically generated., Test failure is unrelated., The bug is valid. The patch mostly looks good to me.

One comment: The test testTokenCancellationByRenewer() right now does owner.doAs( checkTokenCancellation(owner, owner) ). We can pick a different renewer for clarity.

We should perhaps also add more tests with different combinations of full and short names for the renewer, doAs user and the owner..., Uploaded patch with added test cases., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
