[Making TimelineServiceV1Publisher#appFinished synchronous is very dangerous. If ATS1/1.5 daemon is down then primary AsyncDispatcher thread is blocked which makes primary dispatcher event queue grow up. , Attached patch that retain original behavior that is appFinished event processing as asynchronous. 
[~sunilg] Please review the patch. , cc :/ [~naganarasimha_gr@apache.org] [~jlowe] [~leftnoteasy] [~vinodkv] [~sjlee0] [~vrushalic] do you see any critical issues making async for appFinished flow? , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for the patch.

I think one of the reason to make appFinished sync is NOT to loose the event to publish to ATS. Statestore and ATS will get updated same time. Though this approach seems fine, i think there is more risk of exposing a sync event to be called from main Dispatcher. If ATS is down, this will block the dispatcher thread. And a n/w delay or something similar will cause even OOM from RM.

Hence I think its a tradeoff of loosing an event at times, however for time being its better to keep it async till a better cache or similar approach can be brought in to save the finish event publish.

Current approach in the patch seems fine to me. I will wait for others to review the same., I offline synced up with [~rohithsharma]. Moving async definitely willÂ  avoid any potential Async Dispatcher block. This is more important as of now and we can go ahead with this patch for now. Will open another Jira to see how to tackle appFinished event missing scenario.

I will commit this by end of day if there are no objections., Committing shortly., Thanks [~rohithsharma] . Committed to trunk/branch-3.1/branch-3.0/branch-2, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #14419 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/14419/])
