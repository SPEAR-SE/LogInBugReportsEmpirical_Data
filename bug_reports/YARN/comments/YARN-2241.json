[The Exception catching was simply in the wrong place; I moved it to the right place and it now prints a nicer DEBUG message instead of the exceptions/stack traces.  I also added a unit test., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good. +1, I ll have to retract that +1. The fix is good, but the test doesn't do much. 

Actually, the test doesn't fail without the fix. Is that intentional? Without this patch, these exceptions are merely logged and not thrown. I am okay with a patch without the test since we are just changing the logging., I am okay with leaving the test in there to avoid regressions of throwing exceptions in the future. , You're right, it doesn't fail without the fix; I must have checked it with something slightly different than the old code when I tried it.  In that case I don't think we need the test; it's a pretty simple fix and I was able to verify that it worked correctly.

I've uploaded a new patch that doesn't have the test., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
