[node available resource changes while sorting node. we could do a deep copy of node or add -Djava.util.Arrays.useLegacyMergeSort=true to YARN_OPS to use mergeSort not TimSort for Collection#sort,  thought?, Is this dup of YARN-4743? Both issues stack trace would be different but I think root cause is same!!]
