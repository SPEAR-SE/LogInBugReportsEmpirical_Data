[[~jlowe] are you going to work on this? I can take it up if it's fine by you., My apologies for missing this when I put up the patch for YARN-1781, No worries, Varun, we all missed it. ;-)

We may need to track full disks separately from "bad" disks so we can know whether or not it's OK to try to delete a container directory from a particular disk that isn't a known "good" disk.  I'm hesitant to have the NM try to remove container directories even from "bad" disks since touching them can cause a very long pause for the thread that did it., [~jlowe], can you please review the latest patch for YARN-90([apache-yarn-90.4.patch|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12669998/apache-yarn-90.4.patch])? It should handle the case you pointed out here as well. Thanks!, Closing as a duplicate of YARN-90.]
