[I have some thoughts.

Proposal A: NM records its total resource and available resource. When launching a container, NM checks available resource and waits until there is enough resource for container. But there might be a time gap from AM's perspective, AM thinks it has launched container, however container might be waiting for its resource.

Proposal B: RM does not release app's resource until containers actually finish and NM releases the resource. It seems a little complex.

I prefer proposal A. Any suggestion or feedback is greatly appreciated., Attach a WIP patch.  

The patch implements proposal B... Its logic is more reasonable.

When completing a container, RM does not release container's resource until it receive container's finished information from NM., Attach a new patch.

Add a new config to specify whether permits RM release container's resource before NM., \\

This message was automatically generated., Sorry for joining the discussion late, as I missed this originally.  As I mentioned in YARN-5290, having the RM wait until the NM confirms container release can unnecessarily slow down subsequent allocations on other nodes due to scheduler limits (user limit, queue limit, etc.).  We could leverage some form of the NM queuing, but I agree it could be confusing when the AM launches a container and it doesn't appear to be active afterwards when querying the node.

We could have the RM wait until it receives hard confirmation from the NM before it releases the resources associated with a container, but that would needlessly slow down scheduling in some cases. For example, if a user is at the scheduler user limit but releases a container on node A, I don't see why we have to wait until that container is confirmed dead over two subsequent NM heartbeats (one to tell the NM to shoot it and another to confirm its dead) before allowing the user to allocate another container of the same size on node B. However I do think it's bad for us to allocate the new container on the same node as the released one since we can accidentally overwhelm the node if the old container isn't cleaned up fast enough.

Therefore I propose that we go ahead and let the scheduler queues and user limit computations update immediately so other nodes can be scheduled, but we don't release the resources in the SchedulerNode itself until the node confirms a previously running container is dead. IMHO if the RM ever sees a container in the RUNNING state on a node, it should never think that node has freed the resources for that container until the node itself says that container has completed.

Here's a prototype patch against branch-2.7 that is similar to what we're using internally to work around this issue.  It goes ahead and releases the resources for running containers in the scheduler bookkeeping (i.e.: cluster resource, queues, user limits, etc.) but _not_ in the SchedulerNode.  So the RM could allocate those resources elsewhere but not on the current node until the node reports the container as completed.

NOTE: with any of these "wait until the node says the container is done" approaches it's important to get the fix for YARN-5197 or if the NM ever skips sending a container completion event the RM will leak those resources on the node.

There is an interesting corner case where the RM has handed out a container to an AM (i.e.: container is in the ACQUIRED state) but it hasn't seen it running on a node yet. If the container is killed by the RM or AM, there's still a chance where the container could appear on the node after the RM has considered those resources freed. We'll have to decide how to handle that race. One way to solve it is to assume the container resources could still be "used" until it has had a chance to tell the NM that the container token for that container is no longer valid and confirmed in a subsequent NM heartbeat that the container has not appeared since. Maybe there's a simpler/faster way to safely free the containers resources for that race condition?, | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Sorry for late. Thanks [~jlowe] for your patch, the patch is more reasonable than mine. Assign it to you now.

The propose is very reasonable. Not sure whether it works well in your cluster? Killing app is not the only case that leads to mismatch of state between NMs and the RM. When app completed and did not clean some containers, RM needs wait those unfinished containers to finish too. These cases might make RM's available resource look like less than before because RM does not release them actually, will it affect the scheduling speed for a busy cluster?

How about this idea: RM consider it used until the container becomes RUNNING(then RM kills it) or becomes invalid? However it will makes the resource unavailable even it has been freed. , Hi [~jlowe] do you have any further feedback on [~hex108]'s comments? Would you be providing a trunk patch also? , I'll try to get a patch for trunk in the next few weeks., Sorry for the delay.  I rebased the patch on trunk and added a unit test.

We've been running with this patch on our production clusters for quite some time now, and it works well for us.  It simply tracks what the node has reported as running and does not allow the space on the node to be freed up until the node has reported the container as completed.  It _does_ free up the space in the scheduler queue sense, just not the specific node.  Therefore if there is sufficient space in the cluster elsewhere for containers the user limit won't artificially slow down allocation.

This patch does not address the race condition discussed above, so there could still be a case where the RM could over-allocate a node if a container is released by the RM when it is in the ACQUIRED state.  The node may be running the container but not yet heartbeated into the RM to let it know, and we will immediately free the space on the node since we never saw it running there.  In practice this isn't a significant problem for us, so this patch is working well to fix the most common case where this occurs (i.e.: container is already running for a while then is released by the RM and quickly re-allocated to something else).

, The unit test failures appear to be unrelated.  They pass for me locally with the patch applied, and there are JIRAs that are tracking those failures.  The TestDelegationTokenRenewer failure is being tracked by YARN-5816 and the TestRMRestart failure is tracked by YARN-5548.

Thanks for the review, [~djp]!  If you agree the failures are unrelated then feel free to commit, or I'll do so in a few days unless I hear otherwise., Yes, I agree that the two test failures are not related to the patch. Thanks [~jlowe] for reminding me. Committing it now., I just commit the 003 patch to trunk and branch-2. For branch-2.8, there are several conflicts there. 
Hi [~jlowe], do we want this commit get landed in branch-2.8? If so, can you put a patch here for branch-2.8? Thx!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #11095 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/11095/])

, The test failures should be unrelated to the patch. TestAMAuthorization and TestClientRMTokens get tracked in HADOOP-12687 and TestWorkPreservingRMRestart get tracked in YARN-5349.
+1 on 2.8 patch. Committing it now., I have commit the patch to branch-2.8 and branch-2.8.0. Thanks [~jlowe] for delivering the fix! Also, thanks [~hex108] for reporting the issue and [~gsaha] for review comments.]
