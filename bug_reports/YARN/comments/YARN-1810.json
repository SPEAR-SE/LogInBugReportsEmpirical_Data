[Had you used a search filter in the past?  I'm wondering if this is the same kind of issue that was reported in MAPREDUCE-5727., It occurs after I hit the little gear on the scheduler page.  I have attached a screenshot.  I'm not sure of the purpose of this gear., Does it also occur if you simply click anywhere on the queue bar?  That page normally filters for just jobs in a particular queue if you click on a queue -- maybe that filtering is not working properly., I've run into it myself several times. It almost always happens after some interaction on the scheduler page., I found if click default queue bar, all running applications will disappear, and click root they will come back.
, This should be caused by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2104. I'll upload a patch to it soon., I updated $('#apps').dataTable().fnFilter(q, 3, true);" field number from 3 to 4, click â€œdefault" queue bar, applications will not disappear.

But I found this fnFilter query will be maintained to "Application" page. As we have multiple queues, If I  click one of them in scheduler page, and go to application page, only applications of clicked queue will show, other applications are filtered. Cause no filter query shows on page, so this may cause confusions.

, I've uploaded a simple fix to YARN-2104, please kindly review!
[~peng.zhang], good suggestion, could you create a JIRA to track it? , OK, I created JIRA: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2221]
