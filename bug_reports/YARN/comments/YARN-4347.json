[Thanks [~yeshavora] for reporting this.
The issue here is that, attempt final state was previously not recorded but app final state was previously recoded. So, when it recovers, NPE throws.

Working on a patch to fix the attempt recovery path - 
If the corresponding app's recovered state is at final state, return the attempt final state accordingly, instead of adding that into scheduler again. , +1, pending Jenkins., A couple of quibbles on the patch:

{code}
     RMApp rmApp =appAttempt.rmContext.getRMApps().get(
{code}

needs a space on the other side of the equals.

Also, your asserts in the test class should have a failure message a the first parameter., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks for reviewing, I fixed the space, 
I think it's clear enough without the assertion msg, as code comments are there. , | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
