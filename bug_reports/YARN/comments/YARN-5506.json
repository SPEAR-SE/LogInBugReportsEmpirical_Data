Not sure if this should change to debug level, since the function is called intentionally when 
{code}
    if (cliParser.hasOption("debug")) {
      dumpOutDebugInfo();
    }
{code}

So perhaps INFO level is fine? , That's a good point. If the level were changed to DEBUG in this code, I guess the logs won't be printed under the following condition:

- the user includes the "debug" option, 
- but with the logging level config set to be "INFO". 

But is this a normal/expected scenario?, bq. the level were changed to DEBUG, I guess the logs won't be printed under the following condition:

Actually, if the log level is set to DEBUG, then everything above that level is printed. So INFO, ERROR, WARN etc all will get printed in addition to DEBUG.

Perhaps we can close this as "Not a Problem". Thoughts [~chenfsd]? , IMO its not a problem, will close this jira as invalid if no further comments !, I agree. Thanks for the replies!, I agree. Thanks for the replies., As confirmed by all its a invalid issue, hence closing it]
