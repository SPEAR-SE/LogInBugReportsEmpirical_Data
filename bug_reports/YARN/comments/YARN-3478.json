[[~xuchenCN] Thanks for reporting the issue. Are you working on the issue? Feel free to take up if you have alread started working on this., Yes , patch uploaded., Hi [~xucheng_chn@yahoo.com.sg], 

IMHO the approach in the patch is not correct  as later on check is there to filter apps and expression will fail always there 
{code}
 if (reqAppStates != null && !reqAppStates.contains(app.createApplicationState())) {
{code}
app.createApplicationState() will return YarnApplicationState and hence reqAppStates.contains will never return true., Thanks Naganarasimha G R ,  fix it, uploaded again., Moving all tickets targeted for the already closed release 2.6.0 into 2.6.1/2.7.2., Should this be targeted to 2.6.2? We're trying to release 2.6.1 soon. Let me know., Unless the patch is ready to go and the JIRA is a critical fix, we'll defer it to 2.6.2. Let me know if you have comments. Thanks!, Cannot stop 2.6.1 for this anymore, it is already way too late. Moving this to 2.6.2 and beyond., Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3., Hi, can we move this out of 2.6.3? Thanks!, Move it to 2.6.4 as no update on this JIRA for a while., Move it out of 2.6.4 given no update for a while., 2.7.3 is under release process, changing target-version to 2.7.4., Moving this issue to 2.6.6. Please move back if you feel otherwise., Moving target version to 2.7.5 due to 2.7.4 release.]
