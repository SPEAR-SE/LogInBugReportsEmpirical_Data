[Report the issue on behalf of [~arpitgupta], Created patch to remove the translation logic from the client, and at the client side we just need to ensure _HOST is going to be mapped to the right timeline server. Add the test cases to verify the responsibility at both the client and server-side DT creating.

Please note that to make this work, core-site.xml that is presented to the timeline server should have proper auth_to_local configuration., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I don't understand why you are using timelineHost to resolve the renewer to be the ResourceManager., bq. I don't understand why you are using timelineHost to resolve the renewer to be the ResourceManager.

Good catch! We should use rmHost.

In addition, it's not necessary to parse RM principal every time we request a timeline DT, move the logic of constructing the renewer to serviceInit., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failures are not related., Can you also check if it works for RM HA where two RMs sit on different host? I checked, it should work. as long as two RMs use the same mapping rule., I don't have a quick setup for RM HA and secure cluster, but the mapping rule is applied every where in this cluster, I think it should work fine.

In fact, this issue is not HA related problem. However, in general, if we want the DT renew to work across RMs, we have to run these RMs as the same operating user name. Otherwise, if DT renewer is set to yarn of RM1, and RM2 is run by yarn'. RM2 can no longer renew the DT. This is not applied just to timeline DT, but all the DTs that we assign RM to renew. Correct me if I'm wrong., Looks good now, +1. Checking this in., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6426 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6426/])
