[In an offline discussion with [~asuresh], [~kkaranasos], and [~subru], we thought of requiring the promotion be approved only by the RM. However, in the context of YARN-1011, I was wondering if the NM should be allowed to auto-promote opportunistic containers in the order they were received.

Would like to hear people's thoughts on this. , [~asuresh] - didn't you already add a way to do this? /cc [~haibochen], Marking as duplicate of YARN-5085]
