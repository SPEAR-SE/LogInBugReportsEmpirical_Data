[I have one small issue with the patch.  In RefelctionUtils.newInstance when it catches an exception it wraps it in a RuntimeException and then throws it, this patch will instead output a small log message.  I would prefer to see it do the same thing as reflectionUtils for compatibility reasons.  Other then that the patch looks good to me., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Oh I didn't notice this before, but the test file has '\t' tab characters in it.  Could you reformat it to remove the tabs and have it correspond to the two spaces per indentation? , reformated tabs to spaces, rethrow an exception during instance creation, i need this to be merged into branch-0.23 as well, The change looks reasonable. What is not clear is why this is being made? Nothing seems to use the pid in the base class nor is there any other code that uses it. , you need to know root pid of process tree to construct it. base class is not using it because its abstract, Then why add it to the constructor of the abstract base class?, you need constructor which is shared by all subclasses. Alternatively, it could be method instead of constructor but because root process pid do not change then constructor is better., I am fine with either setting it through a contructor or through a setter method.  I agree with Radim that the constructor makes it more obvious that it is not supposed to change, but other places tend to use setter methods instead, like with Configuration which is also not supposed to change., let patch be as it is. current code is using constructor for linux variant., Makes since.  Bikas, unless you have a strong objection I will check this in this afternoon., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
