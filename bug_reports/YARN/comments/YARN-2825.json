Is there a reason we need to cast to ContainerImpl?  I think calling context.getContainers().get(containerId).getContainerState() == org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.container.ContainerState.DONE would be equivalent and cleaner since we wouldn't assume the container implementation.  Or we could get the container status and check for COMPLETE which is what other parts of the code are doing., Thanks Jason for reviewing the patch !
bq. Or we could get the container status and check for COMPLETE which is what other parts of the code are doing
the existing method is doing {{cloneAndGetContainerStatus}}, I just wanted to avoid the clone part. 
To conform with the rest of the code and also avoid doing the casting, I exposed the getCurrentState in the interface, as I saw there's another caller needs to do the same., Uploaded a patch to do this, let me know if this is OK, Curious, what's the reasoning to avoid checking for the DONE state?  That's utilizing an existing interface rather than adding a new one.  It's confusing to have two get state methods (current vs. container, but it _is_ a container so...), although I realize it derives from the undesirable situation of having two ContainerState types.  I suppose we could also just expose an isComplete() predicate method since callers are only checking for COMPLETE.

That being said I'm not totally against adding the yarn.api.records state in a new method, just think it's not really necessary.  If we continue along that route then ContainerImpl.getCurrentState needs the Override decorator.  Also ContainerImpl is now an usused import, and should continue to be unnecessary regardless of which route we pursue.
, bq. what's the reasoning to avoid checking for the DONE state?
The only reason is to consistent with the check in {{NodeStatusUpdaterImpl#getContainerStatuses}} where it's checking ContainerState.COMPLETE rather than DONE. i can just change it check DONE instead of adding a new method. updating the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
