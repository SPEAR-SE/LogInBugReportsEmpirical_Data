[Example (lots of things going on in this algorithm. I simplified to just the key pieces for clarity.)
tuples are resources [memory] or [memory,cpu]

just memory:
-----------------
Queue Capacity is [100]
2 active users, both request [10] at a time
User1 is at [45]
User2 is at [40]
Limit is calculated to be 100/2=50, both users can allocate
User2 goes to [50] - now used Capacity is 45+50=95
Limit is still 50
User1 goes to [55] - used Capacity now 50+55=105
Limit is now 105/2
User2 goes to [60] - used Capacity is now 60+55=115
Limit is now 115/2
So on and so forth until maxCapacity is hit.
Notice how the users essentially leap frog one another, allowing the Limit to continually move higher.

memory and cpu
------------------------
Queue Capacity is [100,100]
2 active users, User1 asks for [10,20], User2 asks for [20,10]
User1 is at [35,45]
User2 is at [45,35]
Limit is calculated to be [100/2=50,100/2=50], both users can allocate
User2 goes to [65,45] - used Capacity is now [65+35=100,45+45=90]
Limit is still [50,50]
User1 goes to [45,65] - used Capacity is now [65+45=110,45+65=110]
Limit is now [110/2=55, 110/2=55]
User1 and User2 are now both considered over limit and neither can allocate. User1 is over on cpu, User2 is over on memory.

Open to suggestions on simple ways to fix this. I'm currently thinking a reasonable (simple, effective, computationally cheap, mostly fair) approach might be to give some small percentage of additional leeway for userLimit. 

, Initial patch for comments on approach. Seems to work well in basic testing on 2.6. I don't know how this interacts with label support + userlimit which I think is still lacking in some cases anyway.  Hoping [~leftnoteasy] and others can comment., Hi [~nroberts],
Sorry for my late response and thanks for reporting/working on this. I think your proposal should be good, it computes Σ(user.dominate_share) and user with smallest dominate_share can always continue.
For implementations:
- {{updateConsumedRatio}} being called when clusterResource changed or any resource allocated, but it needs loop all users in the LeafQueue. This should be improved, there could be 100 or more users in a queue.

I think a similar way is, we can save the "user.dominate_share" in each user, and also total_dominate_share = Σ(user.dominate_share) in each LeafQueue, with this, we need only O(1) time when resource allocated/released and O(#user) time when clusterResource changed. Resource allocation/release seems more frequent than clusterResource changed to me.

For label support, in addition to above (if you think above suggestion is fine), we need record user.dominate_share-by-label and total_dominate_share-by-label. Which could solve user-limit-by-label problem.

Please let me know your thoughts.

Thanks,, Updated description.,  [~leftnoteasy] - Thanks for the comments. I'm tweaking patch to avoid summing so often., Hi [~leftnoteasy]. Uploaded a new version of patch that addresses the inefficiency and adds unit tests.

I think label support is better left for a separate jira when labels are fully working with userlimits. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Thanks for updating, I took a look at your patch, approach LGTM, but I think node label should be considered in the same JIRA, when doing allocation under a labeled node, user-limit checking in the patch is incorrect. Actually user-limit for exclusive node label is already supported in latest trunk, and user-limit for non-exclusive node label is contains in YARN-3361, I think after YARN-3361, user-limit for node label will be in a good shape.
Would you mind to take a look at computeUserLimit method of the patch attached in YARN-3361?

To support computing consumed-per-partition, User.updateUsageRatio need receive partition as parameter.

Some other comments:
- consumedRatio -> totalDominateConsumed or some other name, it's better to make sum of "dominate" consumed in the name
- consumed -> totalDominatedConsumedByPartition.
- It's better to add a test case to make sure allocation locked descripted in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3388?focusedCommentId=14376060&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14376060 will not happened., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for the comments.

{quote}
I don't think it's any more incorrect than it was prior to the patch. Both trunk and this patch use queueUsage.getUsed() to calculate currentCapacity. iiuc, this is wrong when looking at labeled nodes. Trunk is also using the partition from the resource request and not the partition from the node being evaluated, which I think is also incorrect.  I think it's more correct after YARN-3361 but that's not there yet. 

I don't think I made things any worse than trunk is today, but I can wait until YARN-3361 is in if that will make things easier. 

I can change the name to include Dominant.

The test case you mention should be in there. Without the fix the following assert will fail because we can't get above the queue's capacity of 80%
{code}
    assertTrue(
        "Exepected AbsoluteUsedCapacity > 0.95, got: "
            + b.getAbsoluteUsedCapacity(), b.getAbsoluteUsedCapacity() > 0.95);

{code}


, [~nroberts],
Make sense to me. I really appreciate if you can wait YARN-3361 goes first since it almost closed and it blocks a couple of CS changes in our side. Upon YARN-3361 committed. And I can help with supporting better DRF calculation for partition as well (including supports dominate consumed ratio for partitions) in CS.

Thanks,, [~nroberts], any updates on this?, Yes. I have a patch which I think is close. I need to merge to latest trunk. then I'll post for review., [~leftnoteasy], please take a look at this version of the patch., Thanks updating [~nroberts], took at look at latest patch, some comments:
1) It may be better to rename rbl to partitionResource in a couple of places, rbl is not a very clear name to me.

2) One bigger problem is, updateClusterResource only considered NO_LABEL, but computeUserLimit uses getUsageRatio for all partitions. It will be inaccurate if resource of partition updated.
Solution could be:
a. Only use getUsageRatio when partition=NO_LABEL
b. Recomputes all partitions when updateClusterResource.

I prefer b since other code path in your patch are all considered partitions. You can take a look at CSQueueUtils#updateQueueStatistics, they should have very similar logic to handle partitions when cluster resource updates.

3) It's better not put the user-usage-ratio in ResourceUsage, ResourceUsage is targeting to track common resources for user/app/queue. I suggest to create a ResourceUsage-like structure in LeafQueue, and User/LeafQueue will share it. 

4) Better to split and rename User.updateUsageRatio to User.updateAndGetDeltaOfDominateResourceRatio and User.updateAndGetDominateResourceRatio, the "reset" parameter is not very straight-forward to me.

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for the comments. I agree 2b is the way to go. I will upload a new patch soon., [~leftnoteasy], [~eepayne]. Ok, "soon" was extremely relative;) Sorry about that. 

I think I addressed Wangda's comments but I need label partition experts to take a look.

Any ideas why people don't hit this more often? We find it's very easy to get stuck at queueCapacity even though userLimitFactor and maxCapacity say the system should allocate further. Do you think people aren't using DRF and are mostly just using memory as the resource?, [~nroberts] the patch no longer applies to trunk.  Could you please rebase?  Looks good overall, but it would be nice to have some whitespace around the calculateUserUsageRatio, recalculateQueueUsageRatio, and getUsageRatio methods for readability.
, Thanks for the comments [~jlowe]. upmerged and added whitespace., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |

, Thanks [~nroberts] for updating the patch,

Two minor comments:

Comments:

1) Following check is not required for get/set/incUsageRatio:

{code}
        if (label == null) {
          label = RMNodeLabelsManager.NO_LABEL;
        }
{code}

Because we normalized all requests before submiting to scheduler, you can assume no null labels exist.

2) public float getUsageRatio(String string), it's better to rename the parameter variable to "label" or "partition"
, Thanks [~leftnoteasy] for the comments. I took both suggestions in latest patch and cleaned up some remaining checkstyle issues.
