[The issue is the AM tracking link code is sharing the same common codeÂ as the NM web app. After YARN-2713 this code returns the first RM in HA case and letting is redirect to the active HA. This works in the case of NM as its just getting a remote url.
But in the case of AM tracking URL this is used by the caller to bind to the address. Hence if in HA if anything other than the first RM is active, we end up trying to bind to the other RM address and fail with the error desribed., Made the remote RM web url construction (used by NM) independent of the local one used (by RM), Patch looks good. Few nits:
# Spurious white-space changes in WebAppUtils#getResolvedRMWebAppURLWithoutScheme and WebAppUtils#getResolvedRemoteRMWebAppURLWithoutScheme
# Was the intention to set the hostnames to resolve to 127.0.0.1? 
# Asserts in the tests should have an error message for when the assert fails. 
, Addressed comments 1 and 3. For 2, i meant any ipaddress, made it obvious by changing it to 1.2.3.4
Also made the test not cause any left over mapping and restore any it might affect, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
