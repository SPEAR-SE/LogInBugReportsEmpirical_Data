This message is automatically generated., [~kawaa], thanks for your patch!
looks good overall. Would mind fixing the doc for the memory and also for the min-allocation too ? thx, Jian,

I (Vijay Bhat) can definitely take care of that. Also, since this is my first submission, I wanted to clarify - is the protocol that I assign the JIRA to myself once I submit the patch? Apologies for any confusion. Thanks!

Patch summary:

I've updated the text description for the following properties in yarn-default.xml to be reflective of the actual behavior in the code.

* yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-vcores
* yarn.scheduler.maximum-allocation-vcores
