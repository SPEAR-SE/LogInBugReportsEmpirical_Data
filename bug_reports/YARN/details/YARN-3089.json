It will try, and fail, to delete the individual log files, but then afterwards it issues a recursive delete on the log directory which does succeed.  We only found this problem because we saw delete tasks being leaked in the state store, and that's because errors from the container executor were escaping the try blocks.  See YARN-3090.\n\nbq. For the changes in YARN-2468, we only delete the very old logs from HDFS. We do not delete any logs from NM.\n\nThe call of DeletionService.delete where basepaths are specified but subdir is empty/null is new with YARN-2468, specifically in this part of the code in AppLogAggregatorImpl.uploadLogsForContainers:\n\n{code}\n        this.delService.delete(this.userUgi.getShortUserName(), null,\n          uploadedFilePathsInThisCycle\n            .toArray(new Path[uploadedFilePathsInThisCycle.size()]));\n{code}\n\nThe LCE wasn't properly handling the case when the basedirs arguments are _not_ directories.  (Based on the name of the argument, this isn't that surprising.)\n\nThe breakage we'll see is that on systems using the LCE the local delete triggered by the above code will not occur.  If the log directory is not going to be deleted shortly afterwards then we won't cleanup logs on the local disk in a timely manner after aggregation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-04T14:33:53.967+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T14:33:53.967+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769431/comment/14305545","id":"14305545","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

The call of DeletionService.delete where basepaths are specified but subdir is empty/null is new with YARN-2468, specifically in this part of the code in AppLogAggregatorImpl.uploadLogsForContainers:\n\nThanks for explanation. Jason. \n\nbq. do you still want this committed to 2.6.1 given it should only affect LRS apps?\n\nFor normal applications, the application logs directory will be deleted after the application is finished. As Jason mentioned, this action gets succeed.  \nFor the LRS applications, We deleted the logs which is already uploaded. \n{code}\nthis.delService.delete(this.userUgi.getShortUserName(), null,\n          uploadedFilePathsInThisCycle\n            .toArray(new Path[uploadedFilePathsInThisCycle.size()]));\n{code}\n\nSo, whether it can affect the LRS apps, my answer is \"depends on\". It is users' responsibility to roll over their logs. YARN will upload and clean the logs which exist in the log directory.\nCurrently, it depends on how users want to roll-over their application logs and set up the LogAggregationContext. \nFor example, If the users roll-over the logs with some pattern, say \"log.1, log.2, ..., etc\", and set up the includePattern in LogAggregationContext with something like \"log.(\\\\d+)\". So, YARN will only upload the logs (log.1, log.2), and delete the logs (log.1, log.2) afterward. In this case, *i do not think this LRS app is affected at all*.\n\nBut if the user does not set any includePattern/excludePattern in  LogAggregationContext, and does not want to roll-over the logs, all container logs will be written into the files with the same name(run the command, such as 1>>stdout, 2>>stderr ). After we aggregate the logs into HDFS, the stdout/stderr will be deleted. *In this case, this LRS app is affected.*","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-04T23:36:04.613+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T23:36:04.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769431/comment/14308204","id":"14308204","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"bq.

If the app doesn't roll its own logs but is normally not very chatty such that it isn't much of an issue, we're going to blow away the apps logs every log-aggregation.roll-monitoring-interval-seconds interval?  That interval isn't configurable per app, so I can see cases where someone puts an app on the cluster that isn't super long running, doesn't roll its own logs, but then this feature comes along and uploads a partial log and removes the active log files.  In other words, fixing this bug may actually start deleting logs we shouldn't delete on clusters using the LCE.  However that's a separate JIRA from this, as this is focusing on making the behavior of the LCE consistent with the default executor wrt. deletes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-05T23:06:41.093+0000","updated":"2015-02-05T23:06:41.093+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769431/comment/14308232","id":"14308232","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
