After fixing my bug application finished with SUCCEEDED status which is obviously wrong.\n\nWhat makes it even a bigger problem IMHO is that it seems like YARN decided not to even attempt to start the other two containers which creates an interesting dilemma. \nHow do you monitor overall application completion when:\n4 Containers are allocated\n2 Started and killed\n2 Didn't start.\nSure I can use AtomicInteger and increment/decrement it.

When a container is killed the NM first sends a SIGTERM and then a short time later (250 msec IIRC) it sends SIGKILL.
