If leaf queue allocated a container.size > (parentQueue.max - parentQueue.usage), parent queue can excess its max resource limit, as following example:\n{code}\n        A  (usage=54, max=55)\n       /     \\\n      A1     A2 (usage=1, max=55)\n(usage=53, max=53)\n{code}\nQueue-A2 is able to allocate container since its usage < max, but if we do that, A's usage can excess A.max.\n\n2) When doing continous reservation check, parent queue will only tell children \"you need unreserve *some* resource, so that I will less than my maximum resource\", but it will not tell how many resource need to be unreserved. This may lead to parent queue excesses configured maximum capacity as well.\n\nWith YARN-3099/YARN-3124, now we have {{ResourceUsage}} class in each class, *here is my proposal*:\n- ParentQueue will set its children's ResourceUsage.headroom, which means, *maximum resource its children can allocate*.\n- ParentQueue will set its children's headroom to be (saying parent's name is \"qA\"): min(qA.headroom, qA.max - qA.used). This will make sure qA's ancestors' capacity will be enforced as well (qA.headroom is set by qA's parent).\n- {{needToUnReserve}} is not necessary, instead, children can get how much resource need to be unreserved to keep its parent's resource limit.\n- More over, with this, YARN-3026 will make a clear boundary between LeafQueue and FiCaSchedulerApp, headroom will consider user-limit,
