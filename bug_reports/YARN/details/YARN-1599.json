We still have many cases where we don't have tracking URLs for whatever reasons.

It is more clicks as argued here, but at the least we can then be consistent. Similarly see YARN-1106.\n\nI can't find the JIRA but given bulk of YARN-321 is done, we are changing the RM UI to add much more information than is present. Clearly the per-framework UI > RM UI in terms of data richness but the second UI isn't trivial anymore.\n\nbq. our users think that the AppMaster logs were lost because the link to the AM attempt logs are not updated and result in HTTP 404\nWhy don't we fix this issue if that is the driving force.
