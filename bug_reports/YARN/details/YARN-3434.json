It hasn't hit the max amount if can allocate or reserved (shouldAllocOrReserveNewContainer()).  The next node heartbeats in that isn't yet reserved and has enough space for it to place a container on.  It first checked in assignContainers -> canAssignToThisQueue.

For instance parentQueue passes this into leafQueue. ParentQueue cares nothing about user limits.  If you stored it there you would either need to track the user it was for or track for all users. ResourceLimits get updated when nodes are added and removed.  We don't need to compute a particular user limit when that happens.    So it would then be out of date or we change to update it when that happens, but that to me is fairly large change and not really needed.\n\nThe user limit calculation are lower down and recomputed per user, per application, per current request regularly and putting this into the global based on how being calculated and used didn't make sense to me. All you would be using it for is passing it down to assignContainer and then it would be out of date.  If someone else started looking at that value assuming it was up to date then it would be wrong (unless of course we started updating it as stated above).  But it would only be for a single user, not all users unless again we changed to calculate for every user whenever something changed. That seems a bit excessive.\n\nYou are correct that needToUnreserve could go away.  I started out on 2.6 which didn't have our changes and I could have removed it when I added in amountNeededUnreserve.  If we were to store it in the global ResourceLimit then yes the entire LimitsInfo can go away including shouldContinue as you would fall back to use the boolean return from each function.   But again based on my above comments I'm not sure ResourceLimit is the correct place to put this.\n\nI just noticed that we are already keeping the userLimit in the User class, that would be another option.  But again I think we need to make it clear about what it is. This particular check is done per application, per user based on the current requested Resource.  The value stored that wouldn't necessarily apply to all the users applications since the resource request size could be different.  \n\nthoughts or is there something I'm missing about ResourceLimits?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-15T14:30:04.293+0000","updated":"2015-04-15T14:30:04.293+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12787696/comment/14496617","id":"14496617","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~tgraves],\nI think your concerns may not be a problem, ResourceLimits will be replaced (instead of updated) when node heartbeat. And ResourceLimits object itself is to decouple Parent and Child (e.g. ParentQueue to Children, LeafQueue to apps), Child doesn't need to understand how Parent compute limits, it only need to respect limits. For example, app doesn't need to understand how queue computing queue capacity/user-limit/continous-reservation-looking, it only need to know what's the \"limit\" considering all factors, so it can make decision to allocate/release-before-allocate/cannot-continue.\n\nThe usage of ResourceLimits in my mind for user-limit case is:\n- ParentQueue compute/set limits\n- LeafQueue store limits (why store see 1.)\n- LeafQueue recompute/set user-limit when trying to do allocate for each app/priority\n- LeafQueue check user-limit as well as limits when trying to allocate/reserve container\n- The user-limit saved in ResourceLimits is only used in normal allocation/reservation path, if it's a reserved allocation, we will reset user-limit to un-limited.\n\n1. Why store limits in LeafQueue instead of passing down?\nThis is required by headroom computing, app's headroom is affected by queue's parent as well as sibling changes, we cannot update all app's headroom when that changes, but we need recompute headroom when app do heartbeat, so we have to store latest ResourceLimits in LeafQueue. See YARN-2008 for more information.\n\nI'm not sure if above can make you understand better about my suggestion.

I am saying user limit and whether it needs to unreserve to make another reservation has nothing to do with the parent queue (ie it doesn't apply to parent queue).  Remember I'm not needing to store user limit, I'm needing to store the fact of whether it needs to unreserve and if it does how much does it need to unreserve.\n\nWhen a node heartbeats it goes through the regular assignments and updates the leafQueue clusterResources based on what the parent passes in. When a node is removed or added then it updates the resource limits (none of these apply to calculation of whether it needs to unreserve or not). \n\nBasically it comes down to is this information useful outside of the small window between when it calculates it and when its needed in assignContainer() and my thought is no.  And you said it yourself in last bullet above.  Although we have been referring to the userLImit and perhaps that is the problem.  I don't need to store the userLimit, I need to store whether it needs to unreserve and if so how much.  Therefore it fits better as a local transient variable rather then a globally stored one.  If you store just the userLImit then you need to recalculate stuff which I'm trying to avoid.\n\nI understand why we are storing the current information in ResourceLimits because it has to do with headroom and parent limits and is recalculated at various points, but the current implementation in canAssignToUser doesn't use headroom at all and whether we need to unreserve or not on the last call to assignContainers doesn't affect the headroom calculation.\n\nAgain basically all we would be doing is placing an extra global variable(s) in the ResourceLimits class just to pass it on down a couple of functions. That to me is a parameter.
