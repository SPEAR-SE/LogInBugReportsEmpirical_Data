However YARN really should not be using bogus users on tokens anyway in case the RPC layer (or other non-YARN systems) try to do something with those users like HADOOP-10650 did.\nbq. if someone else tries to do something with the ugi assuming it actually was a valid user.\nThey aren't really bogus, for many of these calls, we need them to identify the incoming security context / identity when per-app, per-container tokens are used. Server logging / audit logs also can depend on this for operations where the identifier should be app / container etc.\n\nEven though, our core layer is named as UserGroupInformation, in many part of YARN and MapReduce (other than application submission), it is used as a way of propogating \"IdentityInformation\". Arguably, the server side code could simply look at the incoming tokens, find the incoming ID and ignore the user-name altogether. On the flip side, obviously Service-level authorization layer (hadoop-policy.xml) etc are wired into it as system-level users (HADOOP-10650 being a symptom) so I agree with you in that it is kind of disconnected.\n\nMost of this code goes all the way back when I originally implemented security for YARN. And I borrowed this way of doing things strictly from how JobTokens were done in Hadoop 1.x MapReduce. I doubt if we can change this now - we'll have to change each and every API depending on this and their usage to understand both user-name and the specific identifier (like Application ID).\n\nGiven that HADOOP-12413 too care of the invalid group lookups, we are good for now. Changing the usage of UGI to only use real kerberos-names is likely going to be a huge one in YARN / MR.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-04-11T23:32:48.357+0000","updated":"2016-04-11T23:32:48.357+0000"}],"maxResults":5,"total":5,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-3452/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2cv9j:"}}
