I found that NM made the following transformation in launch container which led to this situation:\n{code:java}\n@VisibleForTesting\n  public static String expandEnvironment(String var,\n      Path containerLogDir) {\n    var = var.replace(ApplicationConstants.LOG_DIR_EXPANSION_VAR,\n      containerLogDir.toString());\n    var =  var.replace(ApplicationConstants.CLASS_PATH_SEPARATOR,\n      File.pathSeparator);\n\n    // replace parameter expansion marker. e.g. {{VAR}} on Windows is replaced\n    // as %VAR% and on Linux replaced as \"$VAR\"\n    if (Shell.WINDOWS) {\n      var = var.replaceAll(\"(\\\\{\\\\{)|(\\\\}\\\\})\", \"%\");\n    } else {\n      var = var.replace(ApplicationConstants.PARAMETER_EXPANSION_LEFT, \"$\");\n      *var = var.replace(ApplicationConstants.PARAMETER_EXPANSION_RIGHT, \"\");*\n    }\n    return var;\n  }\n{code}\n\nI think this is a Bug that doesn't even consider the pairing of \"*PARAMETER_EXPANSION_LEFT*\" and \"*PARAMETER_EXPANSION_RIGHT*\" when substituting. But simply substituting for simple violence.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Container Launch expand environment needs to consider bracket matching","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=balloons","name":"balloons","key":"balloons","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"balloons","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=balloons","name":"balloons","key":"balloons","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"balloons","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-7277/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3kqo7:"}}
