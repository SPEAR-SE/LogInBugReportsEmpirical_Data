It refactors the timeline service CORS support and moves it into hadoop-yarn-server-common.\n\nTo preserve the current timeline service behaviour, I've renamed the classes to YarnCrossOriginFilterInitializer and YarnCrossOriginFilter. The timeline service CrossOriginFilterInitializer inherits from YarnCrossOriginFilterInitializer and allows the existing configs to work without any change.\n\nI added a getPrefix function and modified the getFilterParameters function in YarnCrossOriginFilterInitializer to allow it to be shared by the timeline service and YARN.\n\n[~jeagles], [~pramachandran] - can you please review the

Is there a need to allow the design to enable this only for webservices (REST APIs) instead of the whole webserver (builtin UIs and REST apis)?\n\nI don't think there's any such need. As far as I can tell, we don't treat http requests differently i.e. webservices and builtin UI requests are treated the same.\n\nbq. Not sure if there is a question of selecting enabling cors support for different services such as NN webservices vs RM webservices.\n\nI thought about this - I'm not sure there's any benefit to adding one more set of config knobs. The chances are if you're fine with enabling CORS for the RM, you're probably fine enabling it for the NMs and the timeline server as well. If a user wishes to disable or enable CORS for a particular service, they can always set the filter initializers to the appropriate value on the node the service is running on(either via core-site.xml or yarn-site.xml).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-17T13:18:22.759+0000","updated":"2015-09-17T13:18:22.759+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12851107/comment/14901169","id":"14901169","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thinking more on this, a global config might be something that is okay to start with ( we already have a huge proliferation of configs which users do not set ).
