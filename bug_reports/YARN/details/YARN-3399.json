This way\n - by default, single node clusters are good across RM restarts, unless you are running active/standby RMs on the same machine (dev environments)\n - HA RMs have to be setup explicitly to be part of the same cluster - thereby avoiding debuggability issues.\n - For real life use, in order to facilitate RM migrations, administrators will set their own cluster-id.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-26T22:46:37.172+0000","updated":"2015-03-26T22:46:37.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12785675/comment/14383041","id":"14383041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks, Vinod!
