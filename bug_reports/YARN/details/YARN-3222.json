Even by sending an event it's still possible that removeNode was removing new capability from cluster resource ?\nI see a potential risk even if RMNodeResourceUpdateEvent has sent because say Asyndispatcher has events Node_removed,RMNodeResourceUpdate. AsyncDispatcher fetch Node_removed and put it SchedulerEventDispatcher queue. IAC, if SchedulerEventDispatcher is dealyed processing the node_removed may be because of more scheduler events, then RMNodeResourceUpdate is processed first. So there is chance of removing new capability from cluster resource. \nAny thoughts for handling this issue?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2015-03-03T03:57:08.824+0000","updated":"2015-03-03T03:57:08.824+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776070/comment/14344553","id":"14344553","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"I thought in the below way, for handling race in the above scenario discussed\n# if oldNode is same as newNode and change in the capability, then update the resource first in scheduler.\n## ClusterResource=5gb+5gb\n## Update Resource with new node capability, ClusterResource=5gb+10gb(new capability).\n# Remove node with new capability\n## ClusterResource=15gb-10gb(new capability)=5gb\n# Add Node with new capability\n## ClusterResouce=5gb+10gb=15gb which is expected and {{RMNode#totalCapability}} is 10gb\n\nDoes it make sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2015-03-03T05:20:20.004+0000","updated":"2015-03-03T05:20:20.004+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776070/comment/14344739","id":"14344739","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Had a mail chat with [~jianhe] regarding the issue's observed in this jira discussions and decided to split up the jira into 2 separate jira.
