I have updated the description to reflect that. The issue here is that some of the container related operations' audit logs in both NM and RM are too frequent and too many. This may impact performance as well.\n\nNow, there are 2 solutions possible, either remove these logs or change the log level, so that they do not occur in live environment and can be opened only when required. \nAs I wasnt sure if these audit logs have to be removed or not, I changed the log level for some of these logs in RM and all of them in NM. To ensure this, I supported printing of audit logs at different levels, as is done in HBase (as per my info). This is handled as part of YARN-2287\n\nNow for NM, you are correct, Log level can be changed in log4j properties to suppress these logs if required. But for RM, as not all logs have to be suppressed, this cant be done. So to be consistent, I added log levels for both NM and RM. \n\nIf its agreeable to remove these audit logs, that can be a possible solution as well. Pls suggest.

If we want logSuccess of NM audit logs, we're considering them as equivalently important as other component's audit logs.

I think it's necessary to logSuccess for starting/stopping containers. Another place where logSuccess is used is the lifecycle of container (added in YARN-2675). Not sure if that is important too, as RM app/attempt doesn't log this. /cc [~zxu].\n\nSo what's the major NM audit logs do you see in your environment?
