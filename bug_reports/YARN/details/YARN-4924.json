recorded in state store (e.g. if RM kills application)\n2) Prior to cleaning up the containers associated with this application, the NM dies\n3) When NM restarts it attempts to recover the Application, Containers, and FinishedApplication events all associated with this application, in that order\n4) This leads to a NEW to DONE transition for the containers, which will not try to cleanup the actual container since this is supposed to be a pre-LAUNCHED transition\n\niiuc, this happens because when the application transitions from NEW to INITING during Application recovery, the containerInitEvents aren't actually dispatched yet. They are delayed until the AppInitDoneTransition. However, the AppInitDoneTransition may not occur until after the recovery code has handled the FinishedApplicationEvent and queued up KILL_CONTAINER events. So, in effect, the containerKillEvents passed up the containerInitEvents leading to the NEW to DONE transition. \n\n{noformat}\n2016-04-04 18:20:45,513 [main] INFO application.ApplicationImpl: Application application_1458666253602_2367938 transitioned from NEW to INITING\n2016-04-04 18:20:56,437 [AsyncDispatcher event handler] INFO application.ApplicationImpl: Adding container_e08_1458666253602_2367938_01_000004 to application application_1458666253602_2367938\n2016-04-04 18:20:57,062 [AsyncDispatcher event handler] INFO application.ApplicationImpl: Application application_1458666253602_2367938 transitioned from INITING to FINISHING_CONTAINERS_WAIT\n2016-04-04 18:20:57,095 [AsyncDispatcher event handler] INFO container.ContainerImpl: Container container_e08_1458666253602_2367938_01_000004 transitioned from NEW to DONE\n2016-04-04 18:20:57,120 [AsyncDispatcher event handler] INFO application.ApplicationImpl: Removing container_e08_1458666253602_2367938_01_000004 from application application_1458666253602_2367938\n2016-04-04 18:20:57,120 [AsyncDispatcher event handler] INFO application.ApplicationImpl: Application application_1458666253602_2367938 transitioned from FINISHING_CONTAINERS_WAIT to APPLICATION_RESOURCES_CLEANINGUP\n{noformat}\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-04-05T19:19:14.957+0000","updated":"2016-04-05T19:19:14.957+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12956247/comment/15227703","id":"15227703","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"In YARN-4051, we also had containers leak from NEW to DONE transition while recovering.
