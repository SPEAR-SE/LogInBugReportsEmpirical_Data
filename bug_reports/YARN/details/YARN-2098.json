YARN-2003 is committed. It has changes for RM and CS together. \nAll basic changes needed from RM is defined now hence FairScheduler can go ahead.\n\n{{checkAndGetApplicationPriority}} in YarnScheduler now can be extended in FairScheduler to take some default value or to do some validation. And priority is an integer now. So RMAppManager will invoke this method and set priority in RMApp. \n{{yarn.cluster.max-application-priority}}  can be used to get max priority from cluster. And we are doing a max cap if any app is submitted with a high value.\n\nNow FairOrderingPolicy has this new appPriority added for comparision of apps. FairOrderingPolicy also needs this. Please ping me if any help needed, i updated the doc in main thread too.
