The AM, NM, tasks, etc cannot use kerberos to authenticate.  Even if they could, the token is used to securely sign and transport tamper resistant values.  Always using tokens prevents the dreaded \"why does this AM/etc break with security enabled\"?  After using the configured auth for job submission, the code path within yarn is common and the internal auth is of no concern to the user.\n\nThere is no design problem, the api is transparently based on the token + rpc layer meshing to securely transport (whether simple or kerberos auth) the identity and resources requirements between processes. \n\nFeel free to ask Vinod or I questions offline to come up to speed on hadoop & yarn's security.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-17T19:40:01.462+0000","updated":"2014-03-17T19:40:01.462+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12701747/comment/13938479","id":"13938479","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozhurakousky","name":"ozhurakousky","key":"ozhurakousky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Oleg Zhurakousky","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Daryn\n\nUnfortunately I still disagree and here is why. The API in question is a very public API which one uses during the implementation of AM. The fact that it behaves differently once invoked from the AM vs. just a simple API call to a remote cluster is what I am questioning. Nothing stops me from doing the later. Not a comment, doc, javadoc, warning message or anything else. In fact the error message I see is completely misleading and took me on the wrong path of figuring out the cause which resulted in this JIRA (which is different from YARN-944). The current API is not designed in a way to help someone like myself not to make such a mistake. So, from that perspective its still a problem and while I won't be fighting over it by re-opening the issue, I would suggest to rethink. Let's just say that I know a thing or two about the API design but I also play for the same team (HWX) and while I am freely expressing my concerns with good intentions, someone else may not have as much patience and fall back to YARN alternatives (quite a few, depending on how you look). Anyway, I'll leave it up to you.\n\nCheers\nOleg","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozhurakousky","name":"ozhurakousky","key":"ozhurakousky","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Oleg Zhurakousky","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-03-17T22:20:24.190+0000","updated":"2014-03-17T22:20:24.190+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12701747/comment/13938649","id":"13938649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ozhurakousky], how are you creating the client?
