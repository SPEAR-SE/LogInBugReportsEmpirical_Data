However, the patch converts all methods reported by findbugs to synchronized. In cases where findbugs reports a false positive for bugs, that might affect performance. It might be best to commit this patch, but create a separate JIRA to de-synchronize methods. For every method we de-synchronize, we probably need a justification (in comments) as to why it doesn't create a buggy scenario.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-18T16:56:40.807+0000","updated":"2012-07-18T16:56:40.807+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599213/comment/13417959","id":"13417959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pwendell%40gmail.com","name":"pwendell@gmail.com","key":"pwendell@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"NO NAME","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The warnings have been suppressed manually, so let's hold on with this proposed fix and see if we can justify avoiding synchronization here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pwendell%40gmail.com","name":"pwendell@gmail.com","key":"pwendell@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"NO NAME","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-07-19T01:45:05.901+0000","updated":"2012-07-19T01:45:05.901+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599213/comment/13419060","id":"13419060","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi Patrick, Looks like the warnings are showed up in current precommit test again so that we don't suppressed that any more?
