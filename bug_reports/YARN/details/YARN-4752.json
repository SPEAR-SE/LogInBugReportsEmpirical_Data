Two apps A1 and A2 might be starved over their fair share by different amounts, but it is arguably not MORE 'fair' to pick the the app with the larger deficit than probably pickling one at random... Ordering them on starvation time seems better (or maybe track the number of times each starved app is passed over in a pre-emption run and bubble up apps will longer preemptions passes)\n\nAlso, I don't think the 'demand' is calculated accurately in the FSAppAttempt. It looks like the {{updateDemand()}} method in {{FSAppAttempt}} actually adds all RRs in a priority. This means that some requests will be counted 3 times (node + rack + ANY) and will show up as overly starved compared to requests for just ANY resource.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-27T09:04:02.682+0000","updated":"2016-03-27T09:04:02.682+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946005/comment/15391207","id":"15391207","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Working on a branch might help keep the reviews here simple.
