IMO, we should use snake case with upper case like CONTAINER_ID_PREFIX instead of using camel case when we define constants. I think appIdStrPrefix/appAttemptIdStrPrefix should also be fixed.\n\nYes, the upper case is pretty standard for naming the final static variables. However, due to some reasons, ApplicationId and ApplicationAttemptId doesn't follow it. I'd like keep the consistency in  ContainerId as well. In contrast, I'm conservative to change appIdStrPrefix/appAttemptIdStrPrefix as they are open to the users. Therefore the change may affect the existing users, in particular after GA release.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-21T01:53:29.068+0000","updated":"2013-10-21T01:53:29.068+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674675/comment/13800387","id":"13800387","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi Ozawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"How about adding Deprecated annotation to appIdStrPrefix/appAttemptIdStrPrefix for 2.2.x's backward compatibility , and adding upper case constants for 2.3.0 or later releases?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi Ozawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-21T06:01:19.326+0000","updated":"2013-10-21T06:01:19.326+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674675/comment/13800450","id":"13800450","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The existing constants are marked as Private and Unstable, so we should be able to change them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-21T08:07:57.228+0000","updated":"2013-10-21T08:07:57.228+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674675/comment/13800477","id":"13800477","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Changed to the upper case.\n\nI'm wondering whether the constant is really private.
