RMStateStore needs the applicationId from ApplicationSubmissionContext, it cannot be null. Therefore, we need to make sure applicationId is set in ApplicationSubmissionContext when the RMApp's transitions are tested.\n\nA specific problem with TestFairScheduler#testNotAllowSubmitApplication is that due to one more state before RMApp enters SUBMITTED, APP_REJECTED is already sent to the attempt. It results in an undefined transition. So before generating the APP_REJECTED event, main thread should be hung on for 100ms and yield the process to asyncDispatcher to move MRApp to SUBMITTED, where the attempt is instantiated and the START event is sent. Therefore, the attempt gets START, moves from NEW to SUBMITTED, where the transition from SUBMITTED to FAILED on APP_REJECTED is defined.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-18T05:59:06.846+0000","updated":"2013-04-18T05:59:06.846+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643126/comment/13634882","id":"13634882","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
