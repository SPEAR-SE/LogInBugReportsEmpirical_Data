However, Hadoop does not have a single login form to validate username and password to issue delegation token.  Without Knox, user can come into the system from various entry points using web browser.  This is the reason that user.name parameter is used to let server know who the end user should be in the absence of Knox to verify end user credential.  User.name is a stop gap solution for not having a SSO.
