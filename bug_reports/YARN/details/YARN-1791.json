If two names collide one can use the URI fragment to provide an alternative name for the symlink.  For example, hdfs:/a/b/c#d will be seen as \"d\" in the container working directory rather than \"c\".  If you require paths to be preserved then you can specify an archive (e.g.: .tar.gz, .zip, etc.) which will be expanded when localized and paths can exist within that.\n\nIn the future please use [mailto:user@hadoop.apache.org] for asking questions.
