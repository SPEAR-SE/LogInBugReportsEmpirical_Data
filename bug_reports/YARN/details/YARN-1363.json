In the RMStateStore, we can refer to the asynchronous process of app and attempt to deal with token identifier. This should be much obvious.\n\n3. The questionable and difficult part will be how users get notified of the success of getting/canceling/renewing DT?\n* RMDelegationTokenSecretManager need to maintain a list of ongoing operations, and listen to the events from RMStateStore to get updated about their progress.\n* It seems we need to modify the API like what YARN-1446 does.

RMDelegationTokenSecretManager handles the completion nofitications from RMStateStore\n\n4. RMStateStore maintains a map of outstanding DT operations.\n\n5. ClientRMService are changed to whether the operation is still in progress or not, and poll the result only when the operation is finished.\n\n6. Update the javadoc in ApplicationClientProtocol\n\n7.
