I think its better to separate non-configured label resources as separate column in metrics table. Few advantages\n- Admin can immediately notice that there are some label which are not-configured or part of cluster resource , hence cannot be used. Any action can be taken with one look in metrics table. As I see, admins may choose not to configure any label due reasons like a) some labels need to be taken out of rotation b) may be a configuration mistake etc. \n- As per proposed approach, if we add up non-configured label resources to cluster resources, we need to go to scheduler page to get details. Yes, its a perception of seeing the data. I think its better if metrics are available separately in the very first place in cluster metrics table. \n- I think we can also have the approach in scheduler to have some info message for non-used or configured labels. It will definitely help to go for indepth analysis.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-07-29T08:34:12.412+0000","updated":"2016-07-29T08:34:12.412+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12993474/comment/15398991","id":"15398991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~sunilg] for your thoughts,\nWell yes its based on perception and its debatable, but my two cents not in favor of your approach are :\n# This is one off wrong configuration scenario for this if we add additional columns, then in general usage(after correction) its not of much use.\n# Currently there are only two resources which are getting monitored (cpu and memory), what about other resources which in future we want to add? so adding multiple columns for each resource for this purpose doesn't seem good.\n# ??Admin can immediately notice that there are some label which are not-configured or part of cluster resource?? : Well its anyway related to Scheduler page if admin sees a warning in *parititon-by-queue-hierarchy chart* IMHO it should be sufficient.\n\nI would like to get the opinion of others too.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-07-29T08:57:16.837+0000","updated":"2016-07-29T08:57:16.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12993474/comment/15399069","id":"15399069","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"From use case perspective, there are 2 use case will pop from user\n# I have *N* nodes in my cluster configured with *M* GB of resource.

I have X resource in my cluster and cluster resource of web UI is displaying the same too. But resource allocation is only some % of X. (not for full cluster).\n\nSometimes admin can find a cluster has some available resource, but nobody can use it. If luckily the user has good understanding of YARN, he/she may come to check scheduler page and knows there's a partition that isn't assigned to any queue.\n\nHowever, in many cases, admin reports this as a potential bug to their vendors or mail list without any investigation.\n\nI think adding both resource (sum of all active NMs and non-usable resources) should help admin easier to figure out what happened.\n\nThoughts? \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-07-29T18:02:49.865+0000","updated":"2016-07-29T18:02:49.865+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12993474/comment/15401408","id":"15401408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for sharing your thoughts [~wangda], From my view i had few points which i mentioned in my earlier [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-5448?focusedCommentId=15398991&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15398991], hope you have considered that.\nOne other approach i could think of is instead of mentioning quantity of total resource under each type(usable and unusable) how about number of unusable(/ unallocatable) nodes ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-08-01T00:38:49.600+0000","updated":"2016-08-01T00:38:49.600+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12993474/comment/15402616","id":"15402616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~Naganarasimha],\n\nbq. 1.
