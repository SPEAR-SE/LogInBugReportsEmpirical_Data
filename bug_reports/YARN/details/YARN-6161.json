This feature requires tracking of port usage by containers, and mapping port redirection for bridged network.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-08-28T20:25:02.956+0000","updated":"2017-08-28T20:25:02.956+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13041446/comment/16144453","id":"16144453","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Is this duplicated by YARN-7079?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-08-28T22:16:35.494+0000","updated":"2017-08-28T22:16:35.494+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13041446/comment/16145630","id":"16145630","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=billie.rinaldi","name":"billie.rinaldi","key":"billie.rinaldi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233"},"displayName":"Billie Rinaldi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Yes, they do appear to be duplicates.
