Having a bulk API simplifies the threading in AM and at the same time helps us to launch containers faster.\n\nbq. Also, the current response is 'void', just an ACK, what would be the response for multiple containers.\nWe do have an empty response object in the protocol, it will become a list. Similarly the client library needs to be modified - may be we can have both single container and multi-container APIs in the clients.\n\nbq.
