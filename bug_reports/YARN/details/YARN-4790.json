Please edit the title so that it highlights the problem only so that we can figure out whatever the solution is.\n\nWhat we need is to *not* penalize applications for system related issues. When YARN finds a node with configuration / permission issues, it should itself take an action to (a) avoid scheduling on that node, (b) alert administrators etc.\n\nImplementing heuristics for app / user level blacklisting to work-around platform problems should be a last-ditch effort. We did that in Hadoop 1 MapReduce as we didn't have clear demarcation between app vs system failures. But that isn't the case with YARN - part of the reason why we never implemented heuristics based per-app blacklisting *in YARN* - we left that completely up to applications.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-03-11T17:01:10.529+0000","updated":"2016-03-11T17:01:10.529+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12949137/comment/15201156","id":"15201156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. when enabling LinuxContainerExecutor, but some node doesn't have such user exists\nAs for the root-cause reported on this JIRA, this invalidates our fundamental assumptions of LinuxContainerExecutor. We assume that user-accounts corresponding to all job-submitters are present on all the machines. If not it is a gross misconfiguration of the system, and should be handled by lower layers like installers / management systems.\n\nIf it is really deemed that we should support different user-accounts on different hosts (for whatever reason), then the right way to look at solving that problem is by recognizing user-accounts as a resource on each host - kind of like node-constraints.
