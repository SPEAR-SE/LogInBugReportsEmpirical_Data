Closing this as a duplicate of YARN-90.\n\nAs for the ability to limit disk space, this has been discussed many times before and as far back as MAPREDUCE-1100.  An unsophisticated solution is to have the container monitor that already is looking for too much memory usage also monitor disk usage and kill the container if its too large.  However this doesn't solve the problem for containers that are writing to locations that aren't container-specific (e.g.: where maps store their shuffle outputs, /tmp, etc.  I think it could be difficult to enforce tasks that are filling the disk in arbitrary ways, but it could be straightforward to catch the task that simply is logging too much.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-08-03T20:59:21.251+0000","updated":"2015-08-03T20:59:21.251+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12851181/comment/14653019","id":"14653019","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashwinshankar77","name":"ashwinshankar77","key":"ashwinshankar77","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashwin Shankar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Jason, this is exactly what I was looking for !","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashwinshankar77","name":"ashwinshankar77","key":"ashwinshankar77","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashwin Shankar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-04T03:27:17.384+0000","updated":"2015-08-04T03:27:17.384+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12851181/comment/14901946","id":"14901946","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We face this problem quite often in our ad hoc cluster and are thinking to implement some basic checkers to make such misbehaved jobs fail fast.\n\nUntil we have a proper solution for yarn, we can have a mapreduce-specific solution in place to protect the cluster from rogue mapreduce tasks?
