Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"We also seeing this problems, and it may make the RM never allocate resource for a queue that has used negative resource.\n\nI did some research and found the this is mainly caused by a race condition of calling AbstractYarnScheduler.completedContainer. Lets take FairScheduler as an example:\n{code:title=FairSchedular.java}\nprotected synchronized void completedContainer(RMContainer rmContainer,\n      ContainerStatus containerStatus, RMContainerEventType event) {\n    if (rmContainer == null) {\n      LOG.info(\"Null container completed...\");\n      return;\n    }\n\n\n    Container container = rmContainer.getContainer();\n\n    // Get the application for the finished container\n    FSAppAttempt application =\n        getCurrentAttemptForContainer(container.getId());\n    ApplicationId appId =\n        container.getId().getApplicationAttemptId().getApplicationId();\n    if (application == null) {\n      LOG.info(\"Container \" + container + \" of\" +\n          \" unknown application attempt \" + appId +\n          \" completed with event \" + event);\n      return;\n    }\n    if(!application.getLiveContainersMap().containsKey(container.getId())){\n      LOG.info(\"Container \" + container + \" of application attempt \" + appId\n      + \" is not alive, skip do completedContainer operation on event \" + event);\n      return;\n    }\n\n    // Get the node on which the container was allocated\n    FSSchedulerNode node = getFSSchedulerNode(container.getNodeId());\n\n    if (rmContainer.getState() == RMContainerState.RESERVED) {\n      application.unreserve(rmContainer.getReservedPriority(), node);\n    } else {\n      application.containerCompleted(rmContainer, containerStatus, event);\n      node.releaseContainer(container);\n      updateRootQueueMetrics();\n    }\n\n    LOG.info(\"Application attempt \" + application.getApplicationAttemptId()\n        + \" released container \" + container.getId() + \" on node: \" + node\n        + \" with event: \" + event);\n  }\n{code}\n\ncompletedContainer method will call application.containerCompleted, which will subtraction the resources used by this container from the usedResource counter of the application. So, if the completedContainer are called twice with the same container, the counter is subtracted too much values. So is the updateRootQueueMetrics call, so we can see negative allocatedMemory on rootQueue.\n\nThe solution is to check whether the container being supplied is still live *inside* the completedContainer (as shown in the patch). There is some check before calling completedContainer, but that's not enough.\n\nFor a more deeply discussion, the completedContainer may be called from two place:\n\n1. Trigered by RMContainerEventType.FINISHED event:\n{code:title=FairScheduler.nodeUpdate}\n// Process completed containers\n    for (ContainerStatus completedContainer : completedContainers) {\n      ContainerId containerId = completedContainer.getContainerId();\n      LOG.debug(\"Container FINISHED: \" + containerId);\n      completedContainer(getRMContainer(containerId),\n          completedContainer, RMContainerEventType.FINISHED);\n    }\n{code}\n\n2. Trigered by  RMContainerEventType.RELEASED\n{code:title=AbstractYarnScheduler.releaseContainers}\ncompletedContainer(rmContainer,\n        SchedulerUtils.createAbnormalContainerStatus(containerId,\n          SchedulerUtils.RELEASED_CONTAINER), RMContainerEventType.RELEASED);\n{code}\n\nRMContainerEventType.RELEASED is not triggered by MapReduce ApplicationMaster, so we won't see this problem on MR jobs. But TEZ will triggered it when it do not need this this container, while the NodeManger will also report a container complete message to RM ,which in turn trigger the RMContainerEventType.FINISHED event. If RMContainerEventType.FINISHED event comes to RM early than TEZ AM, the problem happens.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=guoshiwei","name":"guoshiwei","key":"guoshiwei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shiwei Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-08-24T12:08:00.433+0000","updated":"2015-08-24T12:08:00.433+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845794/comment/14709152","id":"14709152","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=guoshiwei","name":"guoshiwei","key":"guoshiwei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shiwei Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"See this comment: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3933?focusedCommentId=14709146&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14709146","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=guoshiwei","name":"guoshiwei","key":"guoshiwei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shiwei Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-08-24T12:15:33.111+0000","updated":"2015-08-24T12:15:33.111+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12845794/comment/14709251","id":"14709251","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"I think the title here is a bit misleading.
