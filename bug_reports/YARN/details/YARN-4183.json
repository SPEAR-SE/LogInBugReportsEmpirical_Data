This way, the system metrics publisher can publish events to the history server even if the applications do not use the timeline server for execution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mitdesai","name":"mitdesai","key":"mitdesai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10438","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10438","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10438","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10438"},"displayName":"Mit Desai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-25T13:46:17.483+0000","updated":"2015-09-25T13:46:17.483+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12888602/comment/14943832","id":"14943832","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeagles","name":"jeagles","key":"jeagles","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jonathan Eagles","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"[~xgong], this issue is two-fold. 1) The web services publishing should trigger posting history based on generic history enablement and not timeline server enablement. 2) There is still no separation between timeline clients that require delegation tokens and those that don't.

This places an artificial runtime dependency on the timeline service which is not highly available or highly scalable until v2.0.\n\nThe issue regarding putting the yarn.timeline-service.enabled in the resource manager  (breaks #3 above) is that every YarnClientImpl (used in job status, used in job submission) now reaches out to get a delegation token token. This places the timeline service (neither highly scalable or highly available until v2.0) as a runtime dependency for job submission and get many unnecessary delegation token for YarnClients that never intent to use them.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jeagles","name":"jeagles","key":"jeagles","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jonathan Eagles","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-09T20:49:24.436+0000","updated":"2015-11-09T20:49:24.436+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12888602/comment/14999479","id":"14999479","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hi [~jeagles],\nWe are not using ATS at scale you guys are using so you will be the better judge  but just my 2 cents  as an observer :\nbq.

How things worked before this JIRA\n - RM uses {{generic-application-history.enabled}} to activate RMApplicationHistoryWriter (RM sending app events to the now-dead-but-kept-for-compat APPLICATION_HISTORY_STORE)\n - RM uses {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} + {{yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled}} to write app/app-attempt/container events to Timeline Service\n - YarnClient uses {{generic-application-history.enabled}} to talk to the _history_ server irrespective of where the historic data gets stored\n - TimelineClient (embedded inside YarnClient) uses {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} to get tokens and populate during app-submission.\n\nh4. Quick general context\n - Nobody is expected to use RMApplicationHistoryWriter\n - {{yarn.timeline-service.generic-application-history.enabled}} is also supposed to be dead for all purposes. But it is today used beyond the RM using it to activate RMApplicationHistoryWriter\n - SystemMetricsPublisher only writes events to TimelineService (v1, v1.5)\n\nGiven the above, I can't but conclude that the existing configuration is not modeled correctly.\n\nh4. The right thing to do\n - Make SystemMetricsPublisher only respect {{yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled}}\n - Leave {{yarn.timeline-service.generic-application-history.enabled}} as a dead property only to activate RMApplicationHistoryWriter.\n - We can leave {{yarn.timeline-service.generic-application-history.enabled}} to also activate client -> RM for historical data or make RM always proxy these calls for the client\n - There should be an explicit {{yarn.timeline-service.version}} which tells YarnClient to get tokens or not - yes for non-present version (default), v1, v2 but no for v1.5.\n - We should also use the same property in the new API calls proposed for V1.5 YARN-4233 / V2 YARN-2928, lest the users think they can call any API independent of what is supported on server side. The version field has semantics on both client *and* server side at the same time - it's picking a solution end-to-end.\n\nh4.

I agree we should find some better ways to organize \\*.enabled in ATS (we've got two different versions in our code base and will add two more). For end users, we need to provide mechanisms to distinguish at least 3 versions of ATS API calls, v1, 1.5, and v2 in future. \n\nbq. There should be an explicit yarn.timeline-service.version which tells YarnClient to get tokens or not - yes for non-present version (default), v1, v2 but no for v1.5.\nbq.  The version field has semantics on both client and server side at the same time - it's picking a solution end-to-end.\nIIUC, the newly proposed {{yarn.timeline-service.version}} supports a sanity check mechanism: each API should check if the current running ATS's version is equal to or higher than it's required version. For example, when a ATS v1.5 API is called, but {{yarn.timeline-service.version}} is set to v1, it should simply throw an exception. We can also decide if we need to get tokens or not in YARN client by checking this version number. \n\nWe can distinguish API versions through their names. We need to keep the V1 APIs unchanged, but add V15 and V2 after the new APIs to clarify their API version. Inside each V15 and V2 API we can perform the sanity check. \n\nLet's make the {{yarn.timeline-service.version}} change here.

With v.2 and especially early on with v.2, it would be rather useful to be able to enable both v.1 (or v.1.5) and v.2. That would provide a useful verification and comparison environment with a single cluster. The way it's being discussed right now, it sounds like the version would be a single value (mutually exclusive). Wouldn't it be good to have a possibility to be able to enable more than one version? Thoughts?\n\n(*yarn.timeline-service.enabled*)\nAlthough the documentation appears to suggest the use is primarily for clients, I believe it strongly implies it applies to the server-side too. After all, even if it is indicated to the client that the timeline service is enabled, it would be no use obviously (and actually worse than not indicating) if the timeline service was not running. I think it's a completely compatible interpretation it also means strongly that the server-side can interpret this as an instruction to enable all things timeline service.\n\nbq. if the timelineserver daemon is started it directly starts the timelinestore without checking for the configuration \"yarn.timeline-service.enabled\"\n\nThe timelineserver daemon might be able to do it, but the issue is with any other server-side component (e.g. RM, etc.) that needs to see if the timeline server should be supported/used. IMO it should be checked by everything (server-side and client-side) to see if the timeline service is and should be enabled.\n\n(*client-side*)\nI also think ideally each framework (client) should define whether they will use the timeline service. Just because the timeline service is enabled doesn't mean they will use it (like MR today). Ideally the framework should have its own config to use it. Any code of theirs to use the timeline service should be predicated on *both* properties being true.\n\nRegarding versions, as long as clients can discover that the version they want to use is included in the enabled versions (see above) and if their config is also enabled, it should be able to write/read (provided the APIs exist of course).\n\nLastly,\n\nbq. IIUC, the newly proposed yarn.timeline-service.version supports a sanity check mechanism: each API should check if the current running ATS's version is equal to or higher than it's required version.\n\nI'm not entirely sure if this is feasible. \"Higher\" doesn't necessarily mean it will support all versions at and below its own. For example, I don't think we can make a guarantee that v.2 will be able to support all queries for v.1 and v.1.5. What's more appropriate is *an exact match*. IMO we should not make guarantees about lower version compatibility as it's going to be very challenging to pull off and constraining for the newer implementation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-14T00:10:25.472+0000","updated":"2015-11-14T00:10:25.472+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12888602/comment/15004962","id":"15004962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

One thing we need to be careful about is the meaning of the incremental relationships between v1 and v1.5.

For example, I don't think we can make a guarantee that v.2 will be able to support all queries for v.1 and v.1.5. What's more appropriate is an exact match.\nYes.

I'd like to focus on the SystemMetricsPublisher and yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled and yarn.timeline-service.enabled.\n\nbq. as far as 2.7.2 is concerned i feel yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled is sufficient to be configured.\n\nI'm not sure if that is desirable. Here is a key question. Suppose the timeline service is disabled, and no timeline daemons are running. And suppose yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled is *true*, and we changed SystemMetricsPublisher to check only that flag. What would happen? AFAICT, the SystemMetricsPublisher will fire up the timeline client, and will try to send all the events actively to the timeline server. But since the timeline server is down, it will lead to continuous failures of writing to the timeline server, right? IMO, this type of very late failures is deeply unsatisfying and problematic.\n\nIf the answer is \"yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled should not be set to true if the timeline service is disabled\", then it only makes it clear that yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled=true implies yarn.timeline-service.enabled=true. Then we should check it explicitly. Thoughts?\n\nbq. As far as i view it \"yarn.timeline-service.enabled\"* name is misleading, it should be more to signify client requires the timeline service's delegation token. Which will not be a server side config. Thoughts?\n\nI'm not sure if that's how it's currently interpreted, but the way I view it is that it should act as a \"master switch\" for the timeline service; i.e. the highest level switch that toggles the feature on and off on all sides. There can be \"sub-switches\" that can control finer-grained parts of the feature (e.g. the system metrics publisher). But those subfeatures should always check the master switch before checking their own. This will lead to a clean and consistent pattern of using the feature everywhere.\n\nAlso, consider the fact that the system metrics publisher may not be the only server-side component that interacts with the timeline service. There may be others and there will be more with the timeline service v.2 (e.g. NM collector service, etc.). If they all handle the failure case of the timeline server not being up in their own way, it would be quite confusing and error-prone. It would be consistent and easy to handle if everyone checks the master switch (and possibly their own subfeature switch), and wires off the feature as early as possible. So I would argue that yarn.timeline-service.enabled should be interpreted as such a \"master switch\", both for server-side and client-side.\n\nI'd like to hear your thoughts.

If the answer is \"yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled should not be set to true if the timeline service is disabled\", then it only makes it clear that yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled=true implies yarn.timeline-service.enabled=true. Then we should check it explicitly. Thoughts?\n{{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} doesn't imply that timeline service is running as we can enable it and still if the timeline server is not running then we face the same problem. We can configure {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} to be false and still start the AHS / timelineserver, IIUC Its not used any where in the AHS / timelineserver while starting up. Hence i interpreted it to be a client side config which tries to indicate the yarnclient that i am trying to use the timelineserver. My initial thoughts about this configuration was similar to your approach but it will have flaws because just by another configuration we cannot guarantee that timeline service is running in the cluster. \nMay be we can try to fail the RM startup if SMP is not able to connect to Timelineserver,but IIUC  [~jeagles] and [~jlowe] in other ATS 1.5 jira were informing that cluster should run though the timelineserver is not running hence its not desirable to fail the RM startup. Max we can do is to update the document that *\"yarn.resourcemanager.system-metrics-publisher.enabled\"* requires Timelineservice to be running \n\nbq. but the way I view it is that it should act as a \"master switch\" for the timeline service; i.e. the highest level switch that toggles the feature on and off on all sides\nThis implies that when start the timeline service daemon then we need to check for  {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} and if false we need to get it down ? but in none of the other daemons we have it in that way, so will that be ok ? Also if the configurations used for the timelineserver has it but not for the other daemons then again we face issue.\n\nbq. Also, consider the fact that the system metrics publisher may not be the only server-side component that interacts with the timeline service. There may be others and there will be more with the timeline service v.2 (e.g. NM collector service, etc.).\nI agree to fact that we will be having lot of additions in the future versions, but we will be having further configurations like ATS version and on top of this having one more configuration like {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} will it be of use ?.\n\nThese are my views but if we still want to go ahead with  {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} then we might need to come up with a *new configuration* to indicate that client wants to use the timeline server hence create the timeline client and the timelineserver delegation tokens. If as used in the current approach then we will meet the issues as mentioned by [~jeagles]. i.e. server configurations are copied to all clients and if timeline server is enabled then delegation tokens is created. So each client would require to explicitly reset the {{yarn.timeline-service.enabled}} configuration to false if they don't want to use it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-11-16T22:48:23.217+0000","updated":"2015-11-16T22:48:23.217+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12888602/comment/15010072","id":"15010072","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. May be we can try to fail the RM startup if SMP is not able to connect to Timelineserver,but IIUC Jonathan Eagles and Jason Lowe in other ATS 1.5 jira were informing that cluster should run though the timelineserver is not running hence its not desirable to fail the RM startup. \n\nI'm *not* suggesting that we fail the RM if the SMP cannot connect to the timeline server. I'm suggesting we can *disable* the SMP (as opposed to having continuous failures or failing the RM) if we know the timeline service is disabled. That's why the config helps, as it is the clearly indicated intent for running the cluster.\n\nAs you said, it is possible that yarn.timeline-service.enabled is set to false even if the timeline service is up and vice versa. But I think we should assume a reasonable use case here where it is fair to expect the timeline service to be there if yarn.timeline-service.enabled is true.

It's implied that we would need a different config/mechanism for disabling getting the delegation token. I would advocate having a separate client-side config. Whether the server has enabled the timeline service and whether a particular client/app will use it are separate concerns, and separate configs should drive them. The current state of tez and MR is a good example. MR should be able to say I won't use the timeline service even if it is available. Any MR code that uses the timeline service should basically check both configs; i.e. the timeline service should be enabled and its config to use the timeline service should be true.\n\nThis might be an idealistic argument on my part, but I think doing something along that line would lead to cleaner separation of concerns and larger degrees of freedom.
