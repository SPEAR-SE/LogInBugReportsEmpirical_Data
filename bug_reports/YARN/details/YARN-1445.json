FINISHED means the app is totally done and has exited.

See MAPREDUCE-4099 for details.  In hindsight I should have simply called the new state UNREGISTERED to help avoid confusion, and my apologies for that.\n\nI mapped the two RMApp states to a single YarnApplicationState since I didn't think clients needed to know the distinction at the time and doing so meant breaking existing YARN clients since they would now see a new, unrecognized state.

IMOH, it's good to double check the places where FINISHED is used, to see whether we need to handle FINISHING given the change.\n\nLet us walk thru the list:\n1. At LogsCLI::verifyApplicationState(), the function is used to figure out the RMApp state, and see if it is good time to check Logs. If the YarnApplicationState is FINISHING, it will return -1. It means it is not good time to check log. I think that makes sense. RMApp will notify NM to start log aggregation when it is at FINISHED/KILLED/FAILED state\n\n2. At Client::monitorApplication() and UnmanagedAMLauncher::run(). Both of them are used to monitor the application whether it is finished. So, handle YarnApplicationState.FINISHED alone should be enough.\n\n3.WebAppProxyServlet::doGet(). I think we might need to handle FINISHING as well as FINISHED. \n\n4.At TypeConvert::fromYarn(), We can handle FINISHING as well as FINISHED. It will check the FinalApplicationStatus, this FinalApplicationStatus is based on the currentAppAttempt's finalStatus, or is generated by currentState of RMApp (In this case, the RMApp's FINISHING and FINISHED will be counted as the same status)\n\n5.ClientServiceDelegate::getProxy(), we might need to handle YarnApplicationState.FINISHING, too.\n\n6.ApplicationCLI::killApplication(). Here is a question mark. We can kill the AM when the RMApp is at Finishing state, since the AM did not really exist. Just for DS and MR, when the AM did the unregisterApplicationMaster, that means the application is finished, so at this time, if we send kill event, it is meaningless.

(In MR case, or DS case, after AM sent out the unregisterApplicationMaster, it does mean the application is finished, because after that, AM will do nothing but exist). But it may not be the case for the other applications, (AM might do other things, such as monitoring, writing log, etc, after that).

Here's some finding. Correct me if I'm wrong:\n\n1. From FINISHING, RMApp can only go to FINISHED. Therefore, unless RM crashes or hangs, the client will finally get the final state of RMApp\n2. At the point of ApplicationReport, two pieces of information are not available when RMApp is in FINISHING, but are available when RMApp is in FINISHED: diagnostics and finishTime. Note that diagnostics may come from RMAppAttempt as well as from the KILL signal (it is possible when RMApp is in FINISHING).  This diagnostics cannot be passed to RMApp when it is still in FINISHING.\n\nOn the other side, if the users/clients doesn't care about the diagnostics info, and the finishTime, they can deal with FINISHING/FINISHED in the same way. However, if they do, they may expect the complete information only when the state becomes FINISHED. Maybe this is also the guide of fixing the current code where FINISHED is used?\n\nMover, projecting the future, we may have more information that are available in FINISHED, but not in FINISHING (or even transitions from FINISHING to other states?), as we are still actively fixing transition issues.

If an AM is really doing things *after* it unregisters in such a way that the client needs to distinguish FINISHING vs. FINISHED, that itself seems to be a problem.  The AM _must not_ do anything critical after it unregisters, because there are no retries at that point.  Anything critical needs to be done _before_ unregistering so if the AM crashes (or its node crashes) those critical steps will be re-attempted.   In addition there's a limited time in which the app can complete any of these after-unregister tasks, as the RM will kill it if it takes too long and there's no way to ask for more time.\n\nThere still is the issue of final app time/diagnostics, and in that sense maybe FINISHING should map to the client state of RUNNING instead of FINISHED.  By exposing this new, unrecognized state to existing clients, that's essentially how some of them will interpret it if they're looking for explicit, terminal states (like KILLED/FINISHED/FAILED).  Others will interpret it as a terminal state since it's not RUNNING.\n\nThat being said, if we're still bent on exposing this distinction then here's my take:\n\n- For killing FINISHING apps, I think it's OK to either go ahead and kill the container or ignore the request.  For the latter case, the RM is going to try to kill it in a few minutes anyway and forget about it.\n- Be sure to check all the existing occurrences of YarnApplication.FINISHED and make sure we don't need to change that code to handle the new YarnApplication.FINISHING state.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-12-03T23:41:56.220+0000","updated":"2013-12-03T23:41:56.220+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681130/comment/13839108","id":"13839108","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Anything critical needs to be done before unregistering so if the AM crashes (or its node crashes) those critical steps will be re-attempted.\n\nI agree AM should be done (or almost done) when unregistering on RM. Unfortunately, after AM unregistration, RM still has to take additional management work before marking the application done from the point of view of RM. And only after the application is done from the point of view of RM, we are able to get its complete report from RM. FINISHING somehow becomes a transit state, which indicate the application has completed its work, but RM hasn't completed the post-processing work.\n\nbq. There still is the issue of final app time/diagnostics, and in that sense maybe FINISHING should map to the client state of RUNNING instead of FINISHED.\n\nI'm afraid it may be more confusing than merging FINISHING and FINISHED. If I remember it correctly, MR jobclient will check the application state from RM first. If the job is still running, the client will contact MR AM for detailed information. If we map FINISHING to RUNNING, the client will be redirected to MR AM when the application is actually in FINISHING, where RM AM is already unregistered and probably the process is ended. Hence the client will find RM AM cannot be reached.\n\nPersonally, I think unregistration should be the boundary between RUNNING and the post states. FINISHING is proposed to indicate AM is unregistered, but RM hasn't finished the post unregistration work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-04T17:48:01.757+0000","updated":"2013-12-04T17:48:01.757+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681130/comment/13839262","id":"13839262","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Referring to the recently added new internal state KILLING, which is mapped to a prior state before it, we may do the same thing for FINISHING. So, instead of merging FINISHING to FINISHED, we can merging FINISHING to a prior state as well. Then, FINISHED will always be a real final state with diagnostics information ready.\n\nOne problem with this approach is that after unregistration succeeds, the client will still see the application in a non-final state for a while, because internally when an application is at FINISHING, client can already be notified of unregistration success. What we can do is to postpone the unregistration success notification until the application is at FINISHED. Then, when client receives the notification, the application will always in a final state.

It seems impossible, because it will result in a dead lock bellow\n\n1. AM container is waiting for finishing unregistration to move on and exit;\n2. Unregistration is waiting for RM notifying success;\n3. RM is waiting for RMApp moving from FINISHING to FINISHED to return success;\n4. RMApp is waiting for RMAppAttempt moving from FINISHING to FINISHED;\n5. RMAppAttempt is waiting for AM container being finished.\n\nThen, if we return a prior state to the client given the internal FINISHING, and still return unregistration success when RMApp reaches FINISHING, client will see, for example, RUNNING, while the registration is already successful. The inconsistency here may result in some race condition for the process relying on checking the final state.\n\nFor example, MR client will direct user to AM if the application is said not to be in a final state. Then, it is possible that AM is unregistered, and RM tells the client that the application is still running. When the client moves on to contact AM, AM has proceeded and exited before being able to respond the client request.\n\nIt seems that we cannot avoid splitting the user-faced state, and FINISHING can map to a period of an application's life cycle, which is from unregistration to process exit.

The client could check the RM and the app could really be RUNNING, but by the time the client gets around to contacting the app the AM has rushed through the FINISHING and FINISHED state and could be gone by the time the client gets there.  That's why ClientServiceDelegate retries on errors and re-evaluates whether to go to the AM or history server on each retry.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-04T14:36:05.618+0000","updated":"2014-03-04T14:36:05.618+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681130/comment/14308762","id":"14308762","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Cleaning up stale PA patches.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-06T07:23:14.805+0000","updated":"2015-02-06T07:23:14.805+0000"}],"maxResults":36,"total":36,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-1445/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1q4kn:"}}
