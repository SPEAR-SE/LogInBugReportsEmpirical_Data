Thougth I'll do some final cleanup myself that I wanted, but there were a little too many and I wanted us to address a few more issues. So cancelling the patch for some quick comments:\n - We don't use tabs, instead use two spaces. Both the changed files have a tab each\n - Also use standard formatting. The indenting is wrong, no spaces after commas etc.\n - Not related to your patch, but let's make LogReader and LogWriter closeable. Rename LogWriter.closeWriter() to be close()\n - At which point, you won't need AggregatedLogsBlock.closeReader(). Use IOUtils.cleanup() everywhere\n - There are still a few places that are missing the close(). For e.g, +149, 162 etc. I think the better approach is to remove these individual close() calls altogether and put the whole render() method in a try {} finally {} block and then call close() in the finally block.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-20T23:21:41.786+0000","updated":"2013-09-20T23:21:41.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12666075/comment/13814736","id":"13814736","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Apologies for delayed response.
