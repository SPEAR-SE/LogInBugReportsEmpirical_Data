But, they're useful counters. So while it's nice to be able to disable it for a speed boost, I think we should also look into whether there is any more efficient way we can provide those counters. Does anyone have an idea about this?\n\nLacking a more efficient way of determining your child process hierarchy, we could probably do some optimization on the code to filter out the tasks that are actually opened and looked at, eg:\n- only look at directories in /proc which are owned by the current user\n- only look at directories which were created more recently than the current pid's directory\n- for each pid, cache its creation time, and if you've already looked at that pid, don't look at it again in the next iteration of the plugin.\n\nI imagine with the above optimizations we could get the overhead down to 1-2%.\n\nAs for the patch itself, the config naming isn't very clear. In my version I called the same config \"mapred.task.calculate.resource.usage\" -- to indicate that it's a boolean flag, not a class name.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-08-06T22:22:03.238+0000","updated":"2012-08-06T22:22:03.238+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12599900/comment/13429555","id":"13429555","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahmed.radwan","name":"ahmed.radwan","key":"ahmed.radwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahmed Radwan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree Todd, thanks!

Instead, I think it's sufficient to check something like:\n\n{code}\nboolean isPidOwnedByMe(int pid) {\n  File pidDir = new File(procFsDir, String.valueOf(pid));\n  // the environment of a process is only readable by the user\n  // running that process\n  File fileInPidDir = new File(pidDir, \"environ\");\n  return fileInPidDir.canRead();\n}\n{code}\n\nThis wouldn't cause extra forks and I think would have equivalent results, so long as the user running the code isn't root.\n\n----\n\n- excludeList should be named something like {{excludedPids}}\n- The following would be faster using StringUtils.split:\n{code}\nString[] strSplitted = str.split(\"\\\\s+\");\n{code}\n(since the data is exactly space-delimited, we dont need the full overhead of a regex)\n- Rather than setting the configuration as a number of updates to skip, I think it's better to set an interval at which the data will be re-calculated. Otherwise the value of this configuration is scaled with respect to another configuration (the counter update interval), which gets messy.\n- I'm wondering, if we did the owner exclusion, and we improved the parsing to use StringUtils.split, if it might be fast enough to avoid having to cache the exclusions.

Thanks Todd and Phil for your comments! I have updated the patch to get rid of the excludedPids caching which may result in miscalculations due to pid recycling as Todd highlighted. The patch also uses StringUtils.split(). Since getrusage only accounts for terminated children, the updates will be missing important resource usage info for any currently running children which haven't terminated yet, so in my opinion we shouldn't use it. I have also added a time frequency property (in milliseconds instead of skips) determining when the resource usage counters are updated.
