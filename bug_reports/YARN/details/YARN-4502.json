We now perform kill-container and recover-requests in one shot without all the events (which was broken anyways). \n\nMuch of the remaining changes are for test-cases and a bit of renames and refactors.\n\nSummary of the changes:\n\n - AbstractYarnScheduler: Renamed existing completedContainer() method to be {{completedContainerInternal()}} and added a new {{completedContainer()}} which wraps around completedContainerInternal(), does common null-checks and also recovers ResourceRequests as needed\n - SchedulerEventType.KILL_CONTAINER ->SchedulerEventType.KILL_PREEMPTED_CONTAINER and DROP_RESERVATION -> KILL_RESERVED_CONTAINER\n - Got rid of ContainerRescheduledTransition completely. No need for container to send an event to the scheduler. Once this is removed, got rid of ContainerRescheduledEvent too.\n - Moved ContainerPreemptEvent from org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler package into org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.event.
