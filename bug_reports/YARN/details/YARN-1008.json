Said this, maybe what we should do is that AMs should be able to specify a HOST:PORT (which typically will be the DN HOST:PORT), in the case of Minicluster, we would need a mapping between DN HOST:PORT to  NM HOST:PORT when processing the resource request. We should also support directly HOST:PORT without mapping for cases where MiniHDFS is not there.\n\n[~ojoshi], multiple NMs register with its nodeId which contains HOST:PORT, so you have multiple nodes in the minicluster. But the scheduler logic, in all schedulers, use the node.getHost() to do the scheduling, that is why you see it working fine, all nodes report the same host. The problem is, you have no control on which NM you get.\n\nThe challenge is how do we get this to work nicely in minicluster and real setups without disruption.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-08-06T19:18:14.454+0000","updated":"2013-08-06T19:18:14.454+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661155/comment/13735581","id":"13735581","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I think it was a 'simplification for the common usecase' approach in the  API design not considering the possibility of multiple NMs running in the same node. Unless we decide to change that, we shouldn't modify the API. Given that, in order to enable minicluster testing with multiple NMs in the same host we'll have to do some kind of switch in the RM/scheduler. I have an idea, i'll post a new patch soon.

Added javadocs explaing this clearly.\n\nThis works with all 3 schedulers.\n\nThe main motivation for this change is to be able to use yarn minicluster with multiple NMs and being able to target a specific NM instance.\n\nWe could expose this for production use if there is a need. For that we would need to:\n\n* Expose via ApplicationReport the node matching mode: HOSTNAME or HOSTNAME:PORT\n* Provide a mechanism for AMs only aware of HOSTNAME matching mode to work with HOSTNAME:PORT mode\n\nIf there is a usecase for this in a real deployment we should follow up this with another JIRA.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-08-13T13:15:35.886+0000","updated":"2013-08-13T13:15:35.886+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661155/comment/13739913","id":"13739913","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"A few comments:\n\nCan we call the config RM_SCHEDULER_INCLUDE_PORT_IN_NODE_NAME instead of RM_SCHEDULER_USE_PORT_FOR_NODE_NAME?
