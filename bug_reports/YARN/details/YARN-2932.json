Actually, rather than getting the queue's 'preemption-disable' status, I think it would make more sense to get the queue's preemption status. So, something like getPreemptionStatus. It would return true or false, depending on if queue is preemptable or not. What do you think?\nMake sense to me.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-11T18:33:59.953+0000","updated":"2014-12-11T18:33:59.953+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760282/comment/14250633","id":"14250633","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~leftnoteasy], thanks for your comments.

Should consider queue reinitialize when queue preemptable in configuration changes (See {{TestQueueParsing}}). And it's best to add a test for verify that.\nI'm sorry. I don't understand what you mean by the use of the word \"consider.\" Calling {{CapacityScheduler.reinitialize}} will follow the queue hierarchy down and eventually call {{AbstractCSQueue#setupQueueConfigs}} for every queue, so I don't think there is any additional code needed, unless I'm missing something. Were you just saying that I need to add a test case for that?\n\n{quote}\n3. It's better to remove the {{defaultVal}} parameter in {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.isPreemptable}}:\n{code}\npublic boolean isQueuePreemptable(String queue, boolean defaultVal) \n{code}\nAnd the default_value should be placed in {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration}}, like other queue configuration options.\nI understand what you trying to do is moving some logic from queue to {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration}}, but I still think it's better to keep the {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration}} simply gets some values from configuration file.\n{quote}\nThe problem is that without the {{defaultval}} parameter, {{AbstractCSQueue#isQueuePathHierarchyPreemptable}} can't tell if the queue has explicitly set its preemptability or if it is just returning the default. For example:\n{code}\nroot: disable_preemption = true\nroot.A: disable_preemption (the property is not set)\nroot.B: disable_preemption = false (the property is explicitly set to false)\n{code}\nLet's say the {{getQueuePreemptable}} interface is changed to remove the {{defaultVal}} parameter, and that when {{getQueuePreemptable}} calls {{getBoolean}}, it uses {{false}} as the default.\n\n# {{getQueuePreemptable}} calls {{getBoolean}} on {{root}}\n## {{getBoolean}} returns {{true}} because the {{disable_preemption}} property is set to {{true}}\n## {{getQueuePreemptable}} inverts {{true}} and returns {{false}} (That is, {{root}} has preemption disabled, so it is not preemptable).\n# {{getQueuePreemptable}} calls {{getBoolean}} on {{root.A}}\n## {{getBoolean}} returns {{false}} because there is no {{disable_preemption}} property set for this queue, so {{getBoolean}} returns the default.\n## {{getQueuePreemptable}} inverts {{false}} and returns {{true}}\n# {{getQueuePreemptable}} calls {{getBoolean}} on {{root.B}}\n## {{getBoolean}} returns {{false}} because {{disable_preemption}} property is set to {{false}} for this queue\n## {{getQueuePreemptable}} inverts {{false}} and returns {{true}}\n\nAt this point, {{isQueuePathHierarchyPreemptable}} needs to know if it should use the default preemption from {{root}} or if it should use the value from each child queue. In the case of {{root.A}}, the value from {{root}} ({{false}}) should be used because {{root.A}} does not have the property set. In the case of {{root.B}}, the value should be the one returned for {{root.B}} ({{true}}) because it is explicitly set. But, since both {{root.A}} and {{root.B}} both returned {{true}}, {{isQueuePathHierarchyPreemptable}} can't tell the difference.

Without that, queue will not be refreshed. I didn't find any changes to parameter of setupQueueConfig, so I guess so, it's better to add a test to verify it.\n{quote}\nI made the changes to the API for {{AbstractCSQueue#setupQueueConfigs}} to take the additional preemptable parameter. When it is called from {{[Leaf|Parent]Queue#setupQueueConfigs}}, it calls {{AbstractCSQueue#isQueuePathHierarchyPreemptable}} to get the preemptability of the queue.\n\nI tested the fixes in both version 3 and version 4 of this patch on a one-node cluster and on a 10-node cluster. In both version, I was able to change the {{disable_preemption}} properties, refresh the queues using {{yarn rmadmin -refreshQueues}}, and I was able to see the updates on the Scheduler UI page. However, I think I see that if the new list of queues is different than the old list of queues, it would not pick up the parameters for the new queues without this change.\n\n{quote}\nRe 3:\nYou can take a look at how AbstractCSQueue initialize labels,\n\nI think they have similar logic – For node label is trying to get value from configuration, if not set, inherit from parent.

We have already started using the code in YARN-2056 and are using the {{disable_preemption}} property.\n\nAn argument could be made that {{disable_preemption}} is better because it indicates that it is turning off the {{...monitor.capacity.preemption...}} property. If {{disable_preemption}} were changed to {{preemptable}}, someone may look at that property and think that the queue should have that property without considering the overall, system property {{...monitor.capacity.preemption...}}.\n\nHow important is it to you that {{disable_preemption}} property be changed to {{preemptable}}?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-01-15T19:33:47.037+0000","updated":"2015-01-15T19:33:47.037+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760282/comment/14279193","id":"14279193","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
