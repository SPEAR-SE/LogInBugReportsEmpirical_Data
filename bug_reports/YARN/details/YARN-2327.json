NTP sets it host-wide, calculates local clock drift and compensates for it, and has good availability.\n\nFWIW Ant's diagnostics method not only prints out TZ info, it looks at the temp dir and compares its clock with the local time, as the situation \"NAS filestore in different time to host\" can cause chaos with dependency logic\n\n{code}\n\n-------------------------------------------\n Temp dir\n-------------------------------------------\nTemp dir is /var/folders/57/xyts0qt105z1f1k0twk6rd8m0000gq/T/\nTemp dir is writeable\nTemp dir alignment with system clock is -819 ms\n\n-------------------------------------------\n Locale information\n-------------------------------------------\nTimezone Greenwich Mean Time offset=3600000\n\n{code}\n\nFor Hadoop, the problem will be worst in VMs, as their clocks will be jerky and may even go backwards if a VM is moved to another physical host.

I've seen this happen.\n\nWe may want hadoop to help catch that by looking at clocks across a cluster and warning if some is \"significantly\" off. This could be done with the RM catching the times of hosts when they report in -and flagging when one is beyond a configured threshold. Then it'll be left to that ops team to fix it however they do it in the cluster.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2014-07-08T08:42:29.131+0000","updated":"2014-07-08T08:42:29.131+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725957/comment/14055429","id":"14055429","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andrew.wang","name":"andrew.wang","key":"andrew.wang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=andrew.wang&avatarId=19230"},"displayName":"Andrew Wang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Building on what Steve said, is this something that would better belong in a monitoring tool like Ganglia or Ambari?
