This means that only RRs with the same (requestId, priority, resourcename, executionType, resource) will be grouped and aggregated together. \r\n\r\nWhile in RM side, the mapping is SchedulerRequestKey (RequestId, priority) -> LocalityAppPlacementAllocator (ResourceName -> RR). \r\n\r\nThe issue is that in RM side Resource is not in the key to the RR at all. (Note that executionType is also not in the RM side, but it is fine because RM handles it separately as container update requests.) This means that under the same value of (requestId, priority, resourcename), RRs with different Resource values will be grouped together and override each other in RM. As a result, some of the container requests are lost and will never be allocated. Furthermore, since the two RRs are kept under different keys in AMRMClient side, allocation of RR1 will only trigger cancel for RR1, the pending RR2 will not get resend as well. \r\n\r\nIâ€™ve attached an unit test (resourcebug.patch) which is failing in trunk to illustrate this issue.
