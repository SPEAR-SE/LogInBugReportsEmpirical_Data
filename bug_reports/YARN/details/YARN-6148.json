The nodes available to the application depends on the partitions requested by it (if they are accessible from the queue application has been submitted to) so number of nodes reported should also honor that. \nMoreover, NM node count is used by MapReduce AM for instance, to ignore blacklisting. It should use the node count based on requested partitions. Because, it is possible that blacklisting will never be ignored if total number of nodes in the requested partitions(in terms of %) are less than configured % to ignore blacklisting. We can still give a different config value per application but it will be better to use node count based on requested partitions to determine when blacklisting has to be ignored.

This count is better than earlier because its the node count for all used partitions for this app (instead of all nodes in cluster). But I am wary about few use cases.\n\nLets consider  below scenario for MR:\n- AM container is running in LabelA(it has 10 nodes)\n- Maps and reducers are running in LabelB (10 nodes)\n\n4 tasks are failed in one node of LabelB. Now that node ll be blacklisted. \nAs per your code, node count is 20 (Am container's LabelA, Map/Reducer containers LabelB). But for task failure, we need not have to worry about LabelA (AM container node label). We should consider only LabelB here.\n\nSo I think we must send per label node count to MR (only for request partitions). {{<<labelA, 10>, <labelB, 10>>}} It can be a new parameter in the existing protocol. Also MR code to be changed as per this.

I think we should consider per partition node count strictly rather than assuming the application is running with one/two partition. \n\nIn case of blacklisting scenario, application would hang if application is running with multiple partition. Lets say, application is running with <lableA, 5> <labelB, 10><labelC, 10> If all nodes of labelB blacklisted by application, then purging will not happen at any cost. This leads to application hang forever.  YARN has to send per partition node count and also AM should handle per partition count blacklisting. Then the whole problem is solved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2017-02-14T04:03:25.363+0000","updated":"2017-02-14T04:03:25.363+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13040579/comment/15865050","id":"15865050","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~rohithsharma] for your thoughts,\nAgree that it will solve the issue completely but we were targeting this modification for 2.8, hence we kept it simple. we are not against fixing in that way but only thing is where should the modifications land to ?

Maybe make the fix I have done here for branch-2 (i.e. ,make it consistent with the way headroom is currently sent) and send node count per label for trunk.

Some flaws can be pointed out in the way we send headroom calculation as of today as well.\n\nHowever, if we do make this change, what do we do with the old headroom and node count fields. Keep them for backward compatibility? Or deprecate them or remove them? But latter will be disruptive for current AMs'. \nSo some further discussion will be required for this proposed change.

Yes, the flaws with respect to headroom won't be as problematic as it would be with blacklisting in the scenario pointed above. \nIf extra headroom is reported, it will just lead to more reducers being ramped up(as AM will think there are enough resources for map tasks) which may impact assigning of resources to maps. But post MAPREDUCE-6302 this wont lead to forever hanging of jobs. If we send headroom for each label separately we may be able to ramp up/down reducers more effectively.

AM can consider only the cluster node count reported earlier in such cases. This will also help us in handling the case for rolling downgrades.\n# Non Exclusive labels will not be reported in the label to node count unless explicitly requested by AM.\n# Mapreduce AM would consider both map and reduce label expression separately, if they are different, while deciding on ignoring AM blacklisting. We will check label to node count mapping to determine the applicable node counts for both map and reduce. \n# Queue can have a default label too. This needs to be reported to AM as well. Also needs to be reported on move. Can be handled in YARN-6209. Active NM count may depend on it and AM currently does not know anything about default label of queue.\n# Also we can report AM node label from Application Submission context in Register AM response. This is because RM can consider label in ASC if none is specified in AM ask.\n#  Container info sent while reporting allocated containers would also contain label on which container was allocated on. Based on this info we will determine if the node assigned is a default label of queue, map/reduce partition or non exclusive label. We will not count non exclusive label towards ignoring blacklisting. \n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2017-03-06T09:38:59.297+0000","updated":"2017-03-06T10:00:07.432+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13040579/comment/15897155","id":"15897155","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Me and Naga just had an offline discussion with [~sunilg].
