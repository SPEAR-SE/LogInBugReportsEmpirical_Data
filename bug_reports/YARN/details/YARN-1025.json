The environment variable will propagate to child container processes, so this works.\n\nI have a question on how this is expected to work on Linux.  I see code in the {{yarn}} shell script and {{LinuxContainerExecutor}} that propagates java.library.path to children, but I also see checks in {{YARNRunner#warnForJavaLibPath}} that warn if a caller is attempting to control java.library.path and state that the caller should set LD_LIBRARY_PATH instead.  What is the expected way for this to work on Linux?\n\nIf the expectation is for the caller to set LD_LIBRARY_PATH, then this issue is likely a Won't Fix.  Setting PATH on Windows is roughly equivalent to setting LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux.  I'm already using this technique successfully as a workaround.\n\nIf the expectation is that the shell scripts set up java.library.path, and NodeManager propagates that to its children, then we do have a bug on Windows and need to make some code changes.  The first part is changing {{yarn.cmd}} to set java.library.path.  That's a small easy change that gets NodeManager to load hadoop.dll.  To cover the child processes, we'll need additional code changes, probably in {{DefaultContainerExecutor}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-04T19:00:43.491+0000","updated":"2013-08-04T19:00:43.491+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661611/comment/13729549","id":"13729549","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"On Linux, use of LD_LIBRARY_PATH is better because it's easier to manipulate (e.g. path munging) and offers a better search and error handling. When java.library.path is set, jvm tries to load the first match. If it fails, the failure is permanent. I.e. no further search is done. This is unacceptable if the search paths contain libraries for multiple architectures (e.g. 32 bit and 64 bit). When LD_LIBRARY_PATH is used exclusively, the system loader is in charge and it does a much better job.

I think the conclusion then is:\n\n# YARN applications, including MR, are responsible for managing the library path of their launched containers via configuration of LD_LIBRARY_PATH on Linux or PATH on Windows.\n# However, there is still a need for the YARN daemons themselves to launch with a correct library path for finding libhadoop.so or hadoop.dll.  The other Hadoop daemons automatically find the library and set java.library.path, so ResourceManager and NodeManager need to do the same.  They already do this on Linux in the yarn shell script, so we just need to update the cmd scripts with equivalent logic.\n\nI'm leaving this issue open for just the cmd script changes, but we won't make changes for NodeManager to propagate java.library.path to its launched child containers.\n\nI've updated the issue summary and description accordingly.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-08T17:39:45.040+0000","updated":"2013-08-08T17:39:45.040+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661611/comment/13762316","id":"13762316","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm attaching a patch that updates yarn.cmd to set java.library.path, similar to how the shell script works.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-09T21:22:24.396+0000","updated":"2013-09-09T21:22:24.396+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12661611/comment/13762344","id":"13762344","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
