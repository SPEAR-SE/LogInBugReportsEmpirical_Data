But we are forced to configure this also, if we want to achieve what is mentioned in the problem statement of this issue. \nAlso if each leaf queue wants to have its own set of users, all users finally are to be mentioned in root.

It allows admins to configure access to an entire subtree of queues by giving access to the root of the subtree rather than having to add the access to each leaf queue.  So for your example above you'll want to set the root queue's ACLs to be empty so that one must have access to the leaf queue in order to submit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-21T14:06:09.001+0000","updated":"2014-04-21T14:06:09.001+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-1966/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1utc7:"}}
