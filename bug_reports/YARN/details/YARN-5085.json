In case 3, the RM can instruct the NM to upgrade the container via heartbeat response.\n\nbq. I see the need for a promotion, why would we want to demote?

Shouldn't the latter be solely at the discretion of RM/NM ensemble\nI think the AM should always be able to request a change in the ExecutionType of its containers. This should be the case for containers at any stage of their execution, like [~asuresh] mentions.\nLater, we might want to explore the \"automatic\" ExecutionType change by the NM/RM, as you mention, but that should not block us from explicitly asking for it through the AM.\n\nbq. I see the need for a promotion, why would we want to demote?\nI think it is better to keep the API more general in case we introduce more container types, especially if those don't have a strict hierarchy. As an example, we could have preemptable and non-preemptable OPPORTUNISTIC containers. In this case, we might want to change across container types, but that would not be a clear promotion.\nHowever, I agree that we should initially disallow changing container type from GUARANTEED to OPPORTUNISTIC, as it is not clear what the behavior of such a change would be.\n\nMakes sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkaranasos","name":"kkaranasos","key":"kkaranasos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kkaranasos&avatarId=21934","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kkaranasos&avatarId=21934","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kkaranasos&avatarId=21934","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kkaranasos&avatarId=21934"},"displayName":"Konstantinos Karanasos","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-20T19:33:38.514+0000","updated":"2016-05-20T19:33:38.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12969625/comment/15296542","id":"15296542","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sounds reasonable.
