In this case we can move the log message to RecoveredContainerLaunch when it fields the InterruptedException and chooses not to propagate it upwards.\n\nI'm curious why we're not seeing a similar issue with regular ContainerLaunch threads, as they should be interrupted as well.

I'm +1 pending investigation of the ContainerLaunch path and why we don't have to deal with thread interruption there.\n\nbq. But if regular ContainerLaunch get interrupted, we may not care if running container exit code as these running container should be killed soon\n\nIf we're going to kill normal containers on shutdown then why wouldn't we also kill containers we are recovering as well?  For the NM restart scenario we're not supposed to be killing any containers, so it's essentially a question of why doesn't interrupting the ContainerLaunch thread manifest as a container completing as it did for a recovered container.  If we know why that's not possible then we can put in the patch as-is, otherwise I'm wondering if there's another hole we need to plug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-11-12T14:47:14.469+0000","updated":"2014-11-12T14:47:14.469+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12754485/comment/14209920","id":"14209920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"bq. If we're going to kill normal containers on shutdown then why wouldn't we also kill containers we are recovering as well? For the NM restart scenario we're not supposed to be killing any containers.\nMy bad. Sorry for my expression above which isn't right. Yes. We shouldn't kill containers for normal containers (fresh) and recovered containers (survival from NM restart before). \n\nbq.  it's essentially a question of why doesn't interrupting the ContainerLaunch thread manifest as a container completing as it did for a recovered container. \nAgree this is important. For ContainerLaunch (take DefaultContainerExecutor as an example), I think thread are blocking in launchContainer()\n{code}\n    if (isContainerActive(containerId)) {\n        shExec.execute();\n      }\n{code}\nThe shExec.execute() will call Shell.runCommand() with building a new process for the command (with an error monitoring thread). The thread will be waiting at :\n{code}\n// wait for the process to finish and check the exit code\n      exitCode  = process.waitFor();\n{code} \nIt is also possible for InterruptedException get thrown there but the trigger event is not the kill of NM but kill of shell process (so not affected by NM kill). That may be the root cause for the different behavior now for fresh container and recovered container.  This is not my final conclusion, but I would prefer to fix the existing significant bug (block container recovery for recovered containers) here and we can do more investigation later. [~jlowe], what do you think? \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-11-13T15:42:04.167+0000","updated":"2014-11-13T15:42:04.167+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12754485/comment/14209948","id":"14209948","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Agreed.
