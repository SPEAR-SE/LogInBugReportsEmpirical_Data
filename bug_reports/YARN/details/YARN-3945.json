It makes it sound like minimum-user-limit-percent caps the amount of resource to say 50% if there are 2 applications submitted to the queue. This isn't the case (afaik). My understanding is that it tries to guarantee all active  applications this percentage of a queue's capacity (configured or current, whichever is larger). Note: an active application is one that is currently requesting resources, a running application that has all the resources it needs, is NOT active.  If one application stops asking for additional resources, the other applications can certainly go higher than the 50%. user-limit-factor is what determines the absolute maximum capacity a user can consume within a queue. \n\nBasically, minimum-user-limit percent defines how fair the queue is. The lower the value, the sooner the queue will try to spread resources evenly across all users in the queue. The higher the value, the more fifo it behaves.

I think we *might* need to reconsider user-limit / user-limit-factor configuration.

One example is, if we set user-limit = 50, and there're 10 users running, we cannot manage how much resource can be used by each user.\n- It's really hard to understand, I spent time working on CapacityScheduler almost everyday, but sometimes I will forget and need to look at code to see how it is computed. :-(.\nBasically User-limit is computed by:\n{{user-limit = {{min(queue-capacity * user-limit-factor, current-capacity * max(user-limit / 100, 1 / #active-user)}}. But this formula is not that meaningful since #active-user is changing every minute, it is not a predictable formula.\n\nInstead we may need to consider some notion like fair sharing: user-limit-factor becomes max-resource-limit of each user, and user-limit-percentage becomes something like guaranteed-concurrent-#user, when #user > guaranteed-concurrent-#user, rest users can only get idle shares.\n\nWith this approach, and considering we have user-limit-preemption within a queue (YARN-2113), we can get a predictable user-limit.\n\nThoughts?

I don't think we can change it in any significant way at this point without a major configuration switch that clearly indicates you're getting different behavior. I'm sure admins have built up clusters with this tuned in very specific ways, a significant change wouldn't be compatible with their expectations.\nI agree that we cannot change the behavior of this option itself, but I think we can add new option instead. \n\nbq. I don't really agree with this. It may not be doing an ideal job but I think the intent is to introduce fairness between users. It's a progression from 0 being the most fair, and 100+ being more fifo. In your example it's trying to get everyone 50% which isn't likely to happen so in this case it's going to operate mostly fifo. If the intent is to be much more fair across the 10 users, then a much smaller value would be appropriate.\nThe problem I can see is, it uses #active-user to compute user-limit, this can lead to unfair, an example of this:\nA queue has 100 guaranteed resource (capacity=max-capacity=100). And minimum-user-limit=25.\nThere're 4 users in the queue, they're using u1=40, u2=30, u3=20, u4=10 resources. After a while, u3 finished its application, so there're 20 available resources. Only u2 and u1 are asking resources. So the user-limit = max(1/#active-user, 25/100) = 50. So it is possible u2 get all available resource, and usage becomes u1=40, u2=50, u3=0, u4=10. This is very unfair to me.\nAnd I think currently we cannot relief this issue via tuning minimum-user-limit.\n\nbq. Since the scheduler can't predict what an application is going to request in the future, I don't see how a predictable formula is even possible (ignoring the possibility of taking away resources via in-queue preemption). It's not great, but being fair to currently requesting users makes some bit of sense.\nThe definition of predictable in my mind is: given resource request of each user, queue's guaranteed/available/used resource, we can get how much resource of each user can get. The above example shows we cannot get resource of each user can get. If thinking more fair, when there's any available resource, we should give them to users have requirement and also respecting their usage (e.g. we should give 20 available resource to u4 to make usage to be u1=40, u2=30, u3=0, u4=30). \n\nbq. user-limit-factor is the max-resource-limit of each user today, right? The second one seems very hard to track. It seems like one of the initial users can stay in the \"guaranteed\" set as long as he keeps requesting resources. This doesn't seem very fair to the users only getting idle shares.\nYou're correct, it is not good. How about computing fair share (as same as how fair scheduler computes fair share) for users within a queue, it will be a new option like (enable-user-fair-share), and user can choose to use minimum-user-limit OR enable-user-fair-share.

A queue has 100 guaranteed resource (capacity=max-capacity=100). And minimum-user-limit=25.\nThere're 4 users in the queue, they're using u1=40, u2=30, u3=20, u4=10 resources. After a while, u3 finished its application, so there're 20 available resources. Only u2 and u1 are asking resources. So the user-limit = max(1/#active-user, 25/100) = 50. So it is possible u2 get all available resource, and usage becomes u1=40, u2=50, u3=0, u4=10. This is very unfair to me.And I think currently we cannot relief this issue via tuning minimum-user-limit.\nbq. If thinking more fair, when there's any available resource, we should give them to users have requirement and also respecting their usage (e.g. we should give 20 available resource to u4 to make usage to be u1=40, u2=30, u3=0, u4=30).\nHere IMO, as per what you mentioned  *u2 and u1 are asking resources* only these 2 users are active so according to the existing rule we are trying to cap their resources using the minimum user limit and hence u4 doesnt get but if suppose u4 also has resources then it would have become 1/3 = 33% and hence u2/u4 would have got.\nYes of course it doesnt bring the fine grained fairness with the new approach you propose (??fair share : same as how fair scheduler computes fair share, for users within a queue, it will be a new option like *enable-user-fair-share*.??), but neverthless to an extent gives some fairness.\n\nBut anyway this is new approach and would take sufficient amount of time to come into picture but how about fixing the current issue and handling new feature in a separate jira ?\n\nComing to existing issue i have given patch considering the calculation similar to am resource calculation in {{getUserAMResourceLimitPerPartition}}, but i am skeptical about this too as here we are doing \n{{queueCapacities.getMaxAMResourcePercentage(nodePartition) * effectiveUserLimit * userLimitFactor}}\nbut as per the formula you shared earlier \n{{user-limit = {{min(queue-capacity * user-limit-factor,current-capacity * max(user-limit / 100, 1 / #active-user)}}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha
