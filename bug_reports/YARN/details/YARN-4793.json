The APIs of existing frameworks are either too low­ level (native YARN), require writing new code (for frameworks with programmatic APIs ) or writing a complex spec (for declarative frameworks).\r\n\r\nIn addition to building critical building blocks inside YARN (as part of other efforts at YARN-4692), we should also look to simplifying the user facing story for building services. Experience of projects like Slider building real-­life services like HBase, Storm, Accumulo, Solr etc gives us some very good learnings on how simplified APIs for building services will look like.\r\n\r\nTo this end, we should look at a new simple-services API layer backed by REST interfaces. The REST layer can act as a single point of entry for creation and lifecycle management of YARN services. Services here can range from simple single-­component apps to the most complex, multi­-component applications needing special orchestration needs.\r\n\r\nWe should also look at making this a unified REST based entry point for other important features like resource­-profile management (YARN-3926), package-definitions' lifecycle­-management and service­-discovery (YARN-913 / YARN-4757). We also need to flesh out its relation to our present much ­lower level REST APIs (YARN-1695) in YARN for application-­submission and management.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12341436","id":"12341436","description":"3.1.0

I feel in this scenario, a default global setting for artifacts, launch_command etc. is not that appropriate,  different components may likely have different requirements. IMHO, we only need the ones in Component, this makes the interface cleaner and underlying implementation simpler?\n- unique_component_support: what is the primary use-case to have distinct component name ?\n- What is the BaseResource object for? Why does Application, ApplicationStatus, Container, Resource need to extend this class?\n- What does the Artifact#APPLICATION mean ?\n- ApplicationState: What is difference  RUNNNG vs STARTED, FINISHED vs STOPPED\n{code}\nACCEPTED, RUNNING, FINISHED, FAILED, STOPPED, STARTED;\n{code}\n- Application#lifetime: it is String type. Does this mean we have to define a scheme for user to specify the time in string format? How about just using long type ?  \n- ApplicationStatus#errorMessage, how about call it diagnostics ? sometimes we may also return non-error messages.\n\n*Implementation*\n- “hadoop-yarn-services-api” should be under hadoop-yarn-slider module as peer to hadoop-yarn-slider-core\n- why the changes needed in hadoop-project/pom.xml \n- We should not use a deprecated getPort() method {{logger.info(\"Listening at port = {}\", applicationApiServer.getPort());}}, jenkins will report error.\n- couple of things for below code\n{code}\nHADOOP_CONFIG = getHadoopConfigs(); \nSLIDER_CONFIG = getSliderClientConfiguration();\n{code}\n-- We cannot load hdfs config, that's for hdfs servers. Any reason you need the hdfs configs?\n-- Instead of calling these two methods, I think we can just call {{YarnConfiguration yarnConf = new YarnConfiguration()}}. This will automatically load the yarn-site and core-site configs.\n\n- Why do we need to explicitly call initHadoopBinding, which is already called the super.init() previously.\n{code}\n    SliderClient client = new SliderClient() {\n      @Override\n      public void init(org.apache.hadoop.conf.Configuration conf) {\n        super.init(conf);\n        try {\n          initHadoopBinding();\n        } catch (SliderException e) {\n          throw new RuntimeException(\n              \"Unable to automatically init Hadoop binding\", e);\n        } catch (IOException e) {\n          throw new RuntimeException(\n              \"Unable to automatically init Hadoop binding\", e);\n        }\n      }\n    };\n{code}\n- These two catch clauses are identical, and Exception extends Throwable, so we only need catch Throwable, if that's desired. \n{code}\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      logger.error(\"Unable to create SliderClient\", e);\n      throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage(), e);\n    } catch (Throwable e) {\n      logger.error(\"Unable to create SliderClient\", e);\n      throw new RuntimeException(e.getMessage(), e);\n    }\n{code}\n- This will never return null, because the numberOfContainers is intialized as 1. you might want to check zero ?\n{code}\n      // container size\n      if (application.getNumberOfContainers() == null) {\n        throw new IllegalArgumentException(ERROR_CONTAINERS_COUNT_INVALID);\n      }\n{code}\n- The lifetime field will never be null, because it is  intilized as \"unlimited\" by default\n{code}\n    // Application lifetime if not specified, is set to unlimited lifetime\n    if (application.getLifetime() == null) {\n      application.setLifetime(DEFAULT_UNLIMITED_LIFETIME);\n    }\n{code}\n- IIUC, all these code are not needed, because appOptions is only used for logging, uniqueGlobalPropertyCache is not used logically, Python is not required any more in yarn-slider\n{code}\n    if (application.getConfiguration() != null\n        && application.getConfiguration().getProperties() != null) {\n      for (Map.Entry<String, String> propEntry : application.getConfiguration()\n          .getProperties().entrySet()) {\n        if (PROPERTY_PYTHON_PATH.equals(propEntry.getKey())) {\n          addOptionsIfNotPresent(appOptions, uniqueGlobalPropertyCache,\n              SliderXmlConfKeys.PYTHON_EXECUTABLE_PATH, propEntry.getValue());\n          continue;\n        }\n        addOptionsIfNotPresent(appOptions, uniqueGlobalPropertyCache,\n            propEntry.getKey(), propEntry.getValue());\n      }\n    }\n{code}\n- In agent-less world, the status command is probably not required. We need a different mechanism to determine container status. let's remove this for now\n{code}\n    appConfOptTriples.addAll(Arrays.asList(compName, configPrefix.toLowerCase()\n        + \".statusCommand\", DEFAULT_STATUS_CMD));\n{code}\n- remove the unused parameter globalConf in createAppConfigComponent\n- remove unused method createAppConfigGlobal\n- remove the commented out code in this class, there are quite a few places\n- Can you please explain what this code tries to accomplish ? it's hard to understand what it tries to do.\n{code}\n    List<String> convertedDeps = new ArrayList<>();\n    for (String dep : component.getDependencies()) {\n      if (compNameArtifactIdMap.containsKey(dep)) {\n        convertedDeps.add(compNameArtifactIdMap.get(dep));\n      } else {\n        convertedDeps.add(dep);\n      }\n    }\n    if (hasPropertyWithValue(component, PROPERTY_DNS_DEPENDENCY, \"true\")) {\n      if (component.getArtifact().getType() == Artifact.TypeEnum.APPLICATION) {\n        convertedDeps.add(component.getArtifact().getId());\n      } else {\n        convertedDeps.add(compName);\n      }\n    }\n    if (convertedDeps.size() > 0) {\n      appConfOptTriples.addAll(Arrays\n          .asList(compName, \"requires\", StringUtils.join(convertedDeps, \",\")));\n    }\n{code}\n- The lifetime is tied to the application according to the API, why does it need to pass down to every component? IIUC, the flow should be, once the app timeouts, all components for this app timeout.\n{code}\n          // set lifetime only to one component - chose whichever comes first\n          if (firstComponent) {\n            appCompOptionTriples.addAll(\n                createAppConfigComponent(comp.getName(), comp, comp.getName(),\n                    lifetime, globalConfig, null, compNameArtifactIdMap));\n            firstComponent = false;\n          } else {\n            // TODO: Make lifetime non-null for now (avoid throwing exception)\n            appCompOptionTriples.addAll(\n                createAppConfigComponent(comp.getName(), comp, comp.getName(),\n                    null, globalConfig, null, compNameArtifactIdMap));\n          }\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-08-30T12:55:12.697+0000","updated":"2016-08-30T12:55:12.697+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12949274/comment/15449102","id":"15449102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=grey","name":"grey","key":"grey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lei Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Toronto"},"body":"As this Jira targets to build a unified interface, I'd like to share some thoughts related to the resource modeling part. The core of Yarn is still to map the resource and workload. For the resource modeling proposed in YARN-3926, it extends the current Yarn static resource modeling to be a flat resource modeling. The end user has the potential to define/schedule their own resource. I am considering whether we should do further extension to make the resource modeling to be a hierarchy based modeling. The use case I see for future is the heterogenous environment with different hardware accelerators (GPU, Intel Xeon Phi, FPGA, etc). For example, if you treat one GPU as a unit of special resource, the flat resource modeling is good enough. But we are seeing cases that GPU to be shared between applications, even the application prefer to allocate certain range of memory inside GPU to avoid cache rotation issue. In this case, it's hard for scheduler to handle. There is relationship between resource (just like the relationship between applications in Slider). Scheduler must allocate GPU memory and GPU core on the same GPU. \n\nIf we do have vision to cover more complicate environments with Yarn, maybe it's time to consider further extension on the resource modeling together with Slider integration and unified service API.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=grey","name":"grey","key":"grey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lei Guo","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Toronto"},"created":"2016-08-30T14:07:14.398+0000","updated":"2016-08-30T14:07:14.398+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12949274/comment/15453011","id":"15453011","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~gsaha] / [~jianhe], can we please move this initial patch to a sub-task under this JIRA?
