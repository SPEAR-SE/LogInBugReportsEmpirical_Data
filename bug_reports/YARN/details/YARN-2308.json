I did some early work on this problem, and my initial approach is to do a null check in the exact place NPE happened in addApplicationAttempt. Craig Welch carried on with a different approach. The final patch is checking if the queue is removed and err out. I think your problem is worth firing a separate jira, also I'd like to take on the issue you mentioned.
