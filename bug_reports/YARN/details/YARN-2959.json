Note, JobB can't make progress until it gets all its requirement satisfied.\nNext, JobA's appattempt1 registered with RM and since JobA was submitted earlier, RM stops allocating containers to JobB and starts allocating to JobA, satisfying a fraction of its requirement as well.\nNow together jobA,jobB hold the entire cluster, but neither can progress and are deadlocked since their resource requests are partially satisfied.\n\nNote:Above is an example with 2 jobs, however the deadlock can happen with n jobs : J1..Jn if the sequence of AM registration is Jn, J(n-1),..J1.\n \nSolution : one proposed solution is to order the fifo queue by appattempt start/register time instead of app submit time.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Fair Scheduler \"fifo\" option can violate FIFO behavior and cause deadlock among jobs","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashwinshankar77","name":"ashwinshankar77","key":"ashwinshankar77","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashwin Shankar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ashwinshankar77","name":"ashwinshankar77","key":"ashwinshankar77","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ashwin Shankar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761504/comment/14246753","id":"14246753","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for reporting this, Ashwin. A couple of follow-up questions:\n# Is preemption enabled? I would have expected Job B to have containers preempted and handed over to Job A.\n# If Job A was submitted before Job B, we should probably investigate why Job B's AM came up first? Are these MR jobs (or managed AMs)? If they are managed AMs and the order of requests was not honored, considering the AppAttempt start/register time might not help us much.
