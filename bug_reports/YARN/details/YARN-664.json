The requests in the updated example now mean something like \"if you give me a container on rack1, it should have 2048 MB, but if it's on any other rack, it should have 1024 MB\".  I don't think the scheduler should support this, as it's hard to imagine when it would be necessary, and makes it impossible to calculate an application's demand.\n\nIf what you're saying is that the scheduler should be able to support requests like:\npriority=1, location=*, memory=1024\npriority=1, location=rack1, memory=1024\npriority=1, location=*, memory=2048\npriority=1, location=rack1, memory=2048\n\nthat might make sense.  I had filed YARN-314 for this a while ago, but have since become less convinced of its utility.  It would require deepening the data structures in the scheduler, which would mean extra hash lookups for each request.  The philosophy I've perceived in the design has been that containers with different requirements should be requested at explicitly different priorities.

There might be reasons in the current implementations of the schedulers that may make supporting this prohibitive, and so it was not done.\nSay an application is running 2 concurrent but unrelated items that should not be blocked by each other due to performance. Both have different resources sizes. If they are separated by priority then the lower priority item will not get any containers until all the containers for the higher priority item have been allocated. This is by definition of priority. That may lead to poor performance. So the app would want to run both at the same priority and expect the RM to allocate containers to both wherever resources are free to match them.\nThe most simple solution for the RM that I can think off the top of my head is to always use the largest resource size. It may lead to fragmentation but is safe. Currently, the last resource size is used. This means that if the client asks for 1GB and 2GB and the 1GB happens to be the last one set by the RM then the RM will return 2 1GB containers, which is wrong.\nIf we choose to use the largest value as a solution, then we should close this as invalid and use YARN-314 to implement that solution.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-23T02:43:13.124+0000","updated":"2013-05-23T02:43:13.124+0000"}],"maxResults":7,"total":7,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-664/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1ki13:"}}
