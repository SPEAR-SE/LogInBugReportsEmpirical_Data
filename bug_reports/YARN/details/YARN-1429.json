I guess that the order depends on the use case. I felt that the {{YARN_CLASSPATH}} variable is meant for user to plug-in their custom jars, that are not nor should be required by YARN itself. My reasoning for putting such libraries at the end of the {{classpath}} was to prohibit user to inject their own dependency before YARN's and possibly cause random exceptions inside YARN code. For example by adding different {{protobuf}}, {{guava}}, pick-your-favourite dependency that is usually breaking binary compatibility between releases on the {{classpath}} prior the expected version. However I didn't realized that this actually might be desirable behavior in some cases. I'm not sure what should be the behavior here, so I would appreciate guidance.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jarcec","name":"jarcec","key":"jarcec","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jarcec&avatarId=10641","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jarcec&avatarId=10641","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jarcec&avatarId=10641","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jarcec&avatarId=10641"},"displayName":"Jarek Jarcec Cecho","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-26T00:21:35.758+0000","updated":"2013-11-26T00:21:35.758+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12680374/comment/13908664","id":"13908664","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jarcec] [~kkambatl] Is YARN_CLASSPATH meant to be a replacement or something to augment the appropriate classpath? \n\nBased on the above, there seem to be 2 choices:\n\ni) Either use YARN_CLASSPATH or $HADOOP_YARN_HOME/${YARN_DIR}/[lib] i.e user-provided classpath replaces the default values used. \nii) Provide another user flag option ( similar to HADOOP's user classpath first flag ) to allow YARN_USER_CLASSPATH to be added either before or after the original CLASSPATH.
