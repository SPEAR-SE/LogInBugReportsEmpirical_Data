Can't update RM Delegation Token.\");\n      return;\n    }\n    try {\n      updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumberInternal(rmDTIdentifier, renewDate,\n          latestSequenceNumber);\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      notifyStoreOperationFailed(e);\n    }\n  }\n{code}\n{code}\n  @Override\n  protected void updateStoredToken(RMDelegationTokenIdentifier id,\n      long renewDate) {\n    try {\n      LOG.info(\"updating RMDelegation token with sequence number: \"\n          + id.getSequenceNumber());\n      rmContext.getStateStore().updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber(id,\n        renewDate, id.getSequenceNumber());\n    } catch (Exception e) {\n      LOG.error(\"Error in updating persisted RMDelegationToken with sequence number: \"\n            + id.getSequenceNumber());\n      ExitUtil.terminate(1, e);\n    }\n  }\n{code}\nAccording to code above, even when renewing a DT, the last sequence number is updated in the store, which is wrong. For example, we have the following sequence:\n1. Get DT 1 (seq = 1)\n2. Get DT 2( seq = 2)\n3. Renew DT 1 (seq = 1)\n4. Restart RM\nThe stored and then recovered last sequence number is 1. It makes the next created DT after RM restarting will conflict with DT 2 on sequence num.\n\nSecond, the aforementioned bug doesn't happen actually, because the recovered last sequence num has been overwritten at by the correctly one.\n{code}\n  public void recover(RMState rmState) throws Exception {\n\n    LOG.info(\"recovering RMDelegationTokenSecretManager.\");\n    // recover RMDTMasterKeys\n    for (DelegationKey dtKey : rmState.getRMDTSecretManagerState()\n      .getMasterKeyState()) {\n      addKey(dtKey);\n    }\n\n    // recover RMDelegationTokens\n    Map<RMDelegationTokenIdentifier, Long> rmDelegationTokens =\n        rmState.getRMDTSecretManagerState().getTokenState();\n    this.delegationTokenSequenceNumber =\n        rmState.getRMDTSecretManagerState().getDTSequenceNumber();\n    for (Map.Entry<RMDelegationTokenIdentifier, Long> entry : rmDelegationTokens\n      .entrySet()) {\n      addPersistedDelegationToken(entry.getKey(), entry.getValue());\n    }\n  }\n{code}\nThe code above recovers delegationTokenSequenceNumber by reading the last sequence number in the store. It could be wrong. Fortunately, delegationTokenSequenceNumber updates it to the right number.\n{code}\n    if (identifier.getSequenceNumber() > getDelegationTokenSeqNum()) {\n      setDelegationTokenSeqNum(identifier.getSequenceNumber());\n    }\n{code}\nAll the stored identifiers will be gone through, and delegationTokenSequenceNumber will be set to the largest sequence number among these identifiers. Therefore, new DT will be assigned a sequence number which is always larger than that of all the recovered DT.\n\nTo sum up, two negatives make a positive, but it's good to fix the issue. Please let me know if I've missed something here.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12327585","id":"12327585","description":"2.7.0

Please find my replies below.\n\nbq. No need to add isUpdateSeqNo. Updating a non-existing znode is storing a DT, we should update the seq number of it. So we just need to use isUpdate\nThe reason I added this new flag is because when we update the Delegation token, we first check whether znode exists or not. And if it doesnt exist we store it as a new token(not update it). In this case, I think we should not overwrite the sequence number. Now I am not sure if non existence of znode while updating DT is a valid use case(could not think of any) or just defensive programming but anyhow we store DT if znode to be updated is not found.. Refer to code below.\n{code:title=ZKRMStateStore.java}\n  protected synchronized void updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumberInternal(\n      RMDelegationTokenIdentifier rmDTIdentifier, Long renewDate,\n      int latestSequenceNumber) throws Exception {\n    ...........\n    if (existsWithRetries(nodeRemovePath, true) == null) {\n      // in case znode doesn't exist\n      addStoreOrUpdateOps(\n          opList, rmDTIdentifier, renewDate, false, false);\n      LOG.debug(\"Attempted to update a non-existing znode \" + nodeRemovePath);\n    } else {\n      // in case znode exists\n      addStoreOrUpdateOps(\n          opList, rmDTIdentifier, renewDate, true, false);\n    }\n    ......\n  }\n{code}\n\nbq. store|updateRMDelegationTokenAndSequenceNumber is better to be renamed to store|updateRMDelegationToken\nOk. Will change.\n\nbq.  Instead of changing sequenceNumber to 0, can we set 1111 to dtId1 and verify it later?\nWill do so.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-01-03T19:51:08.243+0000","updated":"2015-01-03T19:51:08.243+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761503/comment/14264823","id":"14264823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
