In the YARN api records the URL message is decomposed into hostname, username, port, etc, but it does not provide a means to transport an opaque authority. This becomes problematic when using object stores or other file systems that use something other than a hostname as an authority. \n\nIn our particular case, Google Cloud Storage allows buckets to be named with underscores which is causing the NodeManagers to attempt to localize resources of the form 'gs:///path/to/object' when they should be attempting to localize 'gs://bucket/path/to/object'. Components that are written in terms of o.a.h.fs.Path instances seem to handle this case properly, as do most Path utility methods (toUri, etc).\n\nIt seems that by transporting the authority along with the host, user info, etc, a YARN api URL can properly represent o.a.h.fs.Path instances of this particular form. \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12873783","id":"12873783","filename":"YARN-6725.001.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=AngusDavis","name":"AngusDavis","key":"angusdavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-06-21T02:15:23.527+0000","size":5244,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12873783/YARN-6725.001.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"NodeManager cannot localize files when URL contains opaque authority","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=AngusDavis","name":"AngusDavis","key":"angusdavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=AngusDavis","name":"AngusDavis","key":"angusdavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13081290/comment/16056848","id":"16056848","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=AngusDavis","name":"AngusDavis","key":"angusdavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"body":"First pass at adding authority to YARN URL pb.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=AngusDavis","name":"AngusDavis","key":"angusdavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Vancouver"},"created":"2017-06-21T02:13:44.170+0000","updated":"2017-06-21T02:13:44.170+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-6725/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3givb:"}}
