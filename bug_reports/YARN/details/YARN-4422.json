[~jeagles] or [~jlowe], would you mind taking a look?\n\nThe problem was that when the Applications page in the Generic AHS renders, it depends on a MASTER_CONTAINER_EVENT_INFO being in the AppAttemptReport. If it's not there, it will give up on trying to print start time, node, or log lings. The reason that information then appears when you clidk on the app attempt link is because when the Application Attempt page renders, it just gets the whole list of containers for the app attempt and prints that information for each one, including the AM container, but it still doesn't have an indication which one is the AM container.\n\nThe reason the MASTER_CONTAINER_EVENT_INFO isn't in the AppAttemptReport is because that is provided by the REGISTER event in the System Metrics Publisher, and since this use case doesn't ever get to the point of AM registration, the MASTER_CONTAINER_EVENT_INFO isn't there.\n\nHowever, in all of these cases, the RM container does get a FINISHED event. I fixed this by adding the MASTER_CONTAINER_EVENT_INFO to the FINISHED event.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-04T22:29:18.687+0000","updated":"2015-12-04T22:29:18.687+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12919038/comment/15042570","id":"15042570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 0s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} test4tests {color} | {color:red} 0m 0s {color} | {color:red} The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

No, this JIRA does not fix the issue documented in MAPREDUCE-5502 or MAPREDUCE-4428. This JIRA only affects the Generic application history server's GUI and not the RM Application GUI. Also, as documented in those JIRAs, the problem is not a missing link in the GUI, but that the log history is missing altogether.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric
