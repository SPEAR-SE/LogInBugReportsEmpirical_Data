You are trying to access the log link where the application master itself never launched. From the diagnosis message, it is clear that application is not launched. So first and formost, you need to check the application mater that why it is not launched. There would be some application configuration or classpath issue which you can get it from syserr container logs.\n\nAnd JIRA is meant for tracking development activities.For queries kinldy register to [mailing list|https://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html] and send mail to users mailing list i.e {{user@hadoop.apache.org}}.
