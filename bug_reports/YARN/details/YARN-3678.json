We got an issue wherein NM was being randomly killed at one of the places where Hadoop distribution is deployed. In logs, we could see NM being killed immediately after {{signalContainer}} is called. What happens is as under : \n# LCE sends a SIGTERM to the container and waits for 250 ms\n# Probably within this 250 ms period, container processes the signal and exits gracefully.\n# Now it is possible the pid assigned to container is taken up by some other process or thread(which run as light weight processes in Linux).\n# When LCE again tries to send a SIGKILL to the same pid, it might actually be sending it to another process or thread.\n# As we could not find any other reason for NM going randomly down, we suspect it may have gone down because some new thread of NM took up this pid and SIGKILL may have been sent to it, which may have crashed NM. This is more based on suspicion though rather than fool proof analysis. Not sure how to verify if this indeed happened.\n\nPls note that {{pid_max}} in the deployment was {{32768}}.\nI am not sure about which user was the process owner though. Probably [~gu chi] can shed some light on that.\nAn additional check can be done IMHO.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-05-20T05:47:53.459+0000","updated":"2015-05-20T05:47:53.459+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12831002/comment/14559649","id":"14559649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Tx for the update [~varun_saxena].
