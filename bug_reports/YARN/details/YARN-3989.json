I also do not feel like changing whole commands and suppress the exception across, that is not the intention. For few commands like \"-aadToClusterNodeLabels\", we need to see only suppressed messages which indicates a failure in addition. I agree in other complex commands, we may need traces. So we can selectively take the commands in rmadmin and give meaningful messages while suppressing exception. As mentioned in jira itself, it was trying to focus on nodelabel commands for now.
