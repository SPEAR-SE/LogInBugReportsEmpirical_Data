The MapReduce framework relies on the AM to move the .jhist file to the intermediate directory for the JHS to pick up for the job's history.  If the application is killed before the AM runs or the last app attempt crashes or is otherwise incapacitated (e.g. expires from the RM's point of view) then there will be no history for the job on the JHS.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-05-12T13:21:25.454+0000","updated":"2015-05-12T13:21:25.454+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12829168/comment/14539826","id":"14539826","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anushri","name":"anushri","key":"anushri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Anushri","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"When the link is clicked , it is directed to simply the applications list of cluster.
