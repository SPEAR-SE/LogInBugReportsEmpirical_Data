It would be good to have a unit test as I mentioned before. The test case I uploaded was specific to one issue, but tests with directions of the wire transfers and something like that would be also. May be that is something I will consider adding.\n[~venkatnrangan], you are right that end-to-end functional test (cover whole process of client, wire and server) like your demo test code is also very helpful. It would be great if you can file some JIRA and contribute it. I will help to review it.
