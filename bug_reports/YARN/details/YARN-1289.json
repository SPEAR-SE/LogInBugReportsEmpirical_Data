YARN does not and should not have any implicit dependencies on mapreduce. *If* anyone wants to runs MapReduce jobs on a YARN cluster, configuration of the mapreduce shuffle service is mandatory - however this does not hold true for cases where someone is using YARN to run non-MR applications. \n\nIf someone wanted to change the implementation of the shuffle service to a potentially better/faster implementation, defining a default would create a problem. Also, in terms of future-proofing, what is the expectation if MR in later versions switches to use a different service? Is that expectation that default services will keep on changing over time based on MR implementation changes?

I just have some thoughts here, see if it make sense.\nbq. YARN does not and should not have any implicit dependencies on mapreduce.\nAgree. However, according to my understanding, it doesn't stop YARN to support mapreduce service by default which is still common sense today. Isn't it? There already are some mapreduce related configurations and even with default values there in yarn-default.xml. I just think we should keep consistent there (given we have no plan to remove them out of yarn).\nbq. If someone wanted to change the implementation of the shuffle service to a potentially better/faster implementation, defining a default would create a problem. \nI don't see any problem there as default value is easily get overridden. Am I missing something here?\nbq. what is the expectation if MR in later versions switches to use a different service? Is that expectation that default services will keep on changing over time based on MR implementation changes?\nI think keep default value changing with MR implementations is not a problem today as project MR and YARN has the same release cycle and neither YARN or MR get released separately (correct me if there is plan to separate them out). On the contrary, without default settings, like this case, user has to spend time to track the configuration changes from \"mapreduce.shuffle\" to \"mapreduce_shuffle\". IMO, the value of default value is to save everyone's time of setting common values which quite fit cases here.\nThoughts?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2013-10-15T21:42:49.343+0000","updated":"2013-10-15T21:42:49.343+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673163/comment/13795706","id":"13795706","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Am I missing something here?\nAlso, overriding a default value implies an incompatible change. \n\nI agree that everyone has to configure the shuffle service but it is common knowledge ( atleast I hope it is given that YARN has been around for quite some time ) that it needs to be configured when using MR with YARN. The mapreduce.shuffle issue was a recent change and has probably caused a few problems to quite a few users. But it was a one-off issue and introducing a default as a result does not seem the right solution. The fact that everything is packaged/released together ( as of today ) does not imply we should enforce more tighter dependencies. MR is already moving towards becoming a user-land library ( MAPREDUCE-4421 ) although the aux-service question has not been addressed yet.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-15T21:56:33.101+0000","updated":"2013-10-15T21:56:33.101+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12673163/comment/13795755","id":"13795755","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"OK.
