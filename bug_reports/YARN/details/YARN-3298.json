It's also not about \"small amount of resource cannot be used in a queue\" - It's everything between capacity and max-capacity, which can be a large percentage of the cluster.\n\nIn my mind.\n- I would be ok with changing current-capacity = max(queue.used,queue.capacity)+now-required; because I think it's more consistent. Not strictly necessary though, just an improvement.\n- I don't see an overwhelming reason to make user-limit a precisely enforced hard-limit. Currently, users can't get beyond it by very much, and that seems ok to me. \n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-03-10T15:09:24.134+0000","updated":"2015-03-10T15:09:24.134+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12779920/comment/14357564","id":"14357564","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~nroberts], \nI think I got your point now. Yes, as you said, if we enforce the limit (used + requred <= user-limit), and don't change the user-limit computation, queue cannot over its configured capacity.\n\nOriginally, this ticket trying to solve the jitter problem when we have the YARN-2069. However, YARN-2069 will only take effect when queue becomes over-satisfied, at that time, CS will not give queue more resources. So the jitter won't happen actually.\n\nJitter will happen when we have YARN-2113 (preemption will happen to balance usage between users when queue doesn't over its capacity), at that time, user-limit enforcement should be done.\n\nBasically, I agree with your method, which is {{current_capacity = max(queue.used,queue.capacity)+now_required}}, it can solve the queue cannot over its configured capacity problem, but it seems not necessary at least for now. We can delay this change until YARN-2113 is required.\n\nThoughts?\n\nThanks,\nWangda","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-11T20:43:07.514+0000","updated":"2015-03-11T20:43:07.514+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12779920/comment/14358708","id":"14358708","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I agree.
