Indeed, you are right that it is not a simple stack overflow that causes YARN-7796. However, I looked into it and it might be the right fix.\r\n\r\nThe article you mentioned above is a bit coarse, and it does not tell much about the details. I reproduced your issue with the exact RHEL versions you mentioned. At the time of the crash we have the following values:\r\n{code:java}\r\nRBX=RSP=0x7fffffffe320=BOTTOM-0x1CE0\r\nSIZE=128K=0x20000\r\nRDX=(SIZE + 2*15)/16*16=0x20010\r\nRAX=RSP-(4K-8)-n*4K=0x7ffffffdd328=RSP-0x20FF8 << crashing writing 0 here\r\nRCX=RSP-((SIZE + 2*15)/16*16+3K-8)=0x7ffffffdb318=RSP-0x23008\r\nBUFFER=(RSP - SIZE + 15)/16*16=0x7FFFFFFDE310\r\n{code}\r\nThe stack check code writes a 0 to every page from RSP-(4K-8) down until RCX using RAX as the iterator, which is RSP-0x23008 at the time of the crash. The eventual location of the buffer is a bit above of the crash but not too much.\r\n However, RSP is just 2 pages above the bottom of the stack and we try to check just a few pages below the eventual buffer location, so the write should succeed. In fact, when I try to reproduce the same issue (rh68 built binary on rh74) with a 110K buffer instead of 128K, it works.\r\n As a conclusion, the stack check code seems to be legitimate. However, the code might address the same memory later ending up with the same crash without stack checking. The RHEL 7.4 code does an or of each location with itself and 0. Since the stack check code is similar to what Meltdown does, I am wondering, if we ran into some kernel protection. Moving the buffer to the heap removes all risk running into this protection.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com","name":"miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com","key":"miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342"},"displayName":"Miklos Szegedi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-01-31T15:12:23.076+0000","updated":"2018-01-31T15:12:23.076+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13134808/comment/16347175","id":"16347175","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Jim_Brennan","name":"Jim_Brennan","key":"jim_brennan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10440","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10440","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10440","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10440"},"displayName":"Jim Brennan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks [~miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com] for the detailed analysis!\r\n\r\nI am not suggesting that we revert the fix from YARN-7796 - it clearly resolves the failure we were seeing and works in all cases.\r\n\r\nThe proposal in this Jira is to remove the {{-fstack-check}} flag because it has been shown to cause binary incompatibility issues, depending on the version of gcc a binary is compiled with and the OS it is run on.\r\n{quote}As a conclusion, the stack check code seems to be legitimate. However, the code might address the same memory later ending up with the same crash without stack checking.\r\n{quote}\r\nI'm not sure I follow this? It sounds like you've shown that the size of the buffer matters - 110KB buffer compiled on RHEL 6 with {{-fstack-check}} works on RHEL 7 while it fails for a 128 KB buffer. But the 128 KB buffer works when compiled on RHEL 7 (with or without {{-fstack-check}}).   I agree that it may be that the RHEL 6 version of the stack checking code is tripping some kernel protection when the buffer is big enough.  The RHEL 7 version of the stack checking code does not.  That seems like an incompatibility.\r\n\r\nMy concern is that if we leave the {{-fstack-check}} flag there, some future change may cause a similar problem to the one we fixed in YARN-7796.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Jim_Brennan","name":"Jim_Brennan","key":"jim_brennan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10440","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10440","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10440","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10440"},"displayName":"Jim Brennan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-01-31T16:59:03.299+0000","updated":"2018-01-31T16:59:03.299+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13134808/comment/16348808","id":"16348808","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Jim_Brennan","name":"Jim_Brennan","key":"jim_brennan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10440","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10440","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10440","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10440"},"displayName":"Jim Brennan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I put up a patch for this that changes {{-fstack-check}} to {{-fstack-protector}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Jim_Brennan","name":"Jim_Brennan","key":"jim_brennan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10440","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10440","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10440","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10440"},"displayName":"Jim Brennan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-02-01T16:02:15.432+0000","updated":"2018-02-01T16:02:15.432+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13134808/comment/16348926","id":"16348926","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=genericqa","name":"genericqa","key":"genericqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=genericqa&avatarId=33630"},"displayName":"genericqa","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\r\n\\\\\r\n\\\\\r\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\r\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m 17s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\r\n|| || || || {color:brown} Prechecks {color} ||\r\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\r\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} test4tests {color} | {color:red}  0m  0s{color} | {color:red} The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.
