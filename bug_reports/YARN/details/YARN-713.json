It has almost no recourse for handling the event properly since it's operating at such a high level relative to what generated the error.  It would be better to handle the unknown host exception in a more targeted manner.  Looking at the stack trace from MAPREDUCE-5261, createContainerToken or assignContainer would probably be better targets for a fix.  assignContainer already handles a null result from createContainerToken, maybe createContainerToken should return null when it cannot create a token?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-05-31T22:51:52.143+0000","updated":"2013-05-31T22:51:52.143+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648761/comment/13671954","id":"13671954","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"That, and we should do a sweep of YARN RM (and NM too?) to see where else we depend on DNS..","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-01T02:33:57.439+0000","updated":"2013-06-01T02:33:57.439+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12648761/comment/13671985","id":"13671985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In the attached patch, the exception is handled in RMContainerTokenSecretManager#createContainerToken by returning null.
