[~vinodkv] pointed out to me that it was a known bug and the fix might be more involved that this simple fix. So I removed that fix from the patch. Would be good to double check with him once. I forget the jira tracking the known issue.

We need to create the dirs even in LCE case, and earlier I was thinking that it may be more complex as I thought that we may need some-kind of initApp() API.
