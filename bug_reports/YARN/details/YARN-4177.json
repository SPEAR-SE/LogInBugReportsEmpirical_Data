I've read your post and did some investgations on this.\n{quote}\n1.Inconsistent across cores, hence non-monotonic on reads, especially reads likely to trigger thread suspend/resume (anything with sleep(), wait(), IO, accessing synchronized data under load).\n{quote}\nThis was once a bug on some old OSs, but it seems not a problem on Linux newer than 2.6 or windows newer than XP SP2, if i understand your comment correctly.

As a reference, there're some discussion on clock_gettime which nanoTime depends in http://stackoverflow.com/questions/4943733/is-clock-monotonic-process-or-thread-specific?rq=1, especially in the second post that has 4 supports.\n{quote}\n3.Achieving a consistency by querying heavyweight counters with possible longer function execution time and lower granularity than the wall clock.\nThat is: modern NUMA, multi-socket servers are essentially multiple computers wired together, and we have a term for that: distributed system\n{quote}\nYou mean achieving a consistent time across nodes in a cluster? I think the monotonic time we plan to offer should be limited to node-local.
