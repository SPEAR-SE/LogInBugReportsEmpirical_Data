As soon as it receives first node's (nm1) heartbeat it will try to reserve memory for AM-container (2048MB). However it has only 1024MB of memory.\n* now start nm2 with 2048 MB memory.\n\nIt hangs forever... Ideally this has two potential issues.\n* It should not try to reserve memory on a node manager which is never going to give requested memory. i.e. Current max capability of node manager is 1024MB but 2048MB is reserved on it. But it still does that.\n* Say 2048MB is reserved on nm1 but nm2 comes back with 2048MB available memory.
