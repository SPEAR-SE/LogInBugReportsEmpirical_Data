I have attached an updated patch to address some of your feedback.\n\n{quote}\nDidnt quite get this removal?\n{quote}\n\nThe \"exec\" to launch a command varies per platform.  It needs to be \"@call\" on Windows.  I chose to move this logic into ContainerLaunch.ShellScriptBuilder#command and its subclasses, so that MapReduce and any other YARN applications don't need to repeat if (WINDOWS) checks.  However, it occurs to me that this could be considered a backwards-incompatible change if existing contract is that the application must submit the \"exec\" in its command.  I don't know how significant the impact is, so let me know what you think.\n\nYes, I agree with your assessment that \"setsid\" in the code is really checking for \"process groups supported\".  I've moved MAPREDUCE-4325 to YARN-240 for the rename work.  Meanwhile, I have updated this patch to return true for isSetsidSupported when running on Windows.  (We are saying that WinUtils must be present for Hadoop to work on Windows, so it must be true that process groups are supported.)\n\nI have been trying to minimize the if (WINDOWS) checks.  For the two examples you gave, I didn't see any other logical place to move the checks.  It's so specific to DefaultContainerExecutor that it didn't seem to fit inside Shell.  Let me know if you have any suggestions on this.\n\nI've updated the patch to add a kill command helper method in Shell, but it's slightly different from the branch-1-win version.  YARN uses \"kill -0\" for checking validity of a pid, so I needed to add a special case for signal 0 to use \"winutils task isAlive\" instead of \"winutils task kill\".  In order for error handling to work correctly, I needed to change winutils to return a non-zero exit code from \"winutils task isAlive\".  I refactored isSetsidAvailable into Shell too.\n\nI'm curious if we actually need this validation logic in ProcessIdFileReader or if we can simplify by discarding it.  From what I can tell, the pids are always generated by YARN code, so they are always going to be the expected numeric pid on Unix or the expected container ID on Windows.  It would seem that we can just trust them.  What is the goal of this validation logic?  Is it security protection against an external process feeding in bogus pid values?  I'd expect that to be protected by proper permissions and ownership settings on the node manager's working directories, so the extra logic wouldn't be necessary.  Some other requirement?\n\nIt looks like the closest equivalent of TestKillSubProcesses is some combination of the tests in TestContainerLaunch, TestContainerManager, and TestContainersMonitor.  Right now, nearly all YARN tests fail early on Windows due to validation failures on the test data path containing a drive specification.  I'd prefer to address those test infrastructure failures in a separate jira.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-24T07:47:39.941+0000","updated":"2012-11-24T07:47:39.941+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616965/comment/13503377","id":"13503377","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Its common to suffix patches as .1.patch, .2.patch etc so that its easy to download and diff etc.\n\nChanges look good. \n\nFor the kill -0 change I think I would do it a little differently. I would create containerExists() or containerIsAlive() and use that for the alive check and create a killContainer(TYPE kill) for terminating containers. That does not leak implementation details of Unix like Signal handling into the Hadoop code. Might remove the need to change the native code also. What do you think?\n\nAbout ProcessIdFileReader. I am not sure about the reasoning for that code since it predates me. I do see that checking formats helps us differentiate among OS implementations though I am not sure if that was the original reasoning :P e.g. if we are on Linux we should check that we are getting expected numeric pids. If we are on windows we should check that we are getting containerIds. This helps fail fast. I am not sure if the upper level code would fail if we asked it to use wrong process identifiers.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-24T10:41:13.783+0000","updated":"2012-11-24T10:41:13.783+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616965/comment/13503648","id":"13503648","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks again, Bikas.

Thanks!\nBranch-1-win change would be good. I suspect the code there relies on parsing the output instead of an error exit code. I dont remember why I did it that way. If it was an oversight then it would be good to fix. If there was a need to do it that way then we might have check that it does not get broken.\n\n+1","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-29T06:40:47.683+0000","updated":"2012-11-29T06:40:47.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12616965/comment/13526642","id":"13526642","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.
