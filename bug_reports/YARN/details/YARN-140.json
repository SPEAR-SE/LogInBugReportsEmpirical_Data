Since it has the same name as the one in the jar, then it replaces the one in the classpath and since CapacitySchedulerConfiguration constructor loads a single resource (capacity-scheduler.xml), then the loaded configuration will be only the ones from the user's capacity-scheduler.xml, and no defaults are loaded from the file packaged in the jar.\n\nby default confs, I mean stuff like:\n\n{code}\n  <property>\n    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.capacity</name>\n    <value>100</value>\n  </property>\n  <property>\n    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-applications</name>\n    <value>10000</value>\n  </property>\n  <property>\n    <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.maximum-am-resource-percent</name>\n    <value>0.1</value>\n  </property>\n{code}\n\nwhich are all lost and the user need to explicitly add them again to his xml, or otherwise face errors like the one I mentioned above in the description.\n\nSo to address this problem, my attached patch modified the CapacitySchedulerConfiguration constructor to load two resources instead of one, so the default confs can be preserved and optionally overridden by the user confs.\n\nOne other option is to provide a template conf with our distribution and populate this file with all the defaults (basically a copy of the one in the package), and then instruct users to use this file, but I think this option is less convenient as it requires manual preservation of these defaults by the user and knoweledge of what to change vs what to keep, etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahmed.radwan","name":"ahmed.radwan","key":"ahmed.radwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahmed Radwan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-02T22:30:30.396+0000","updated":"2012-10-02T22:30:30.396+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609947/comment/13468230","id":"13468230","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"I agree with Ahmed assessment/suggestion, we should have a c-s-default.xml with all default values in the JAR and a c-s-site.xml in conf/ for the admin to setup their custom values.

It is true that the capacity of root should be always 100, or otherwise an exception will be thrown, see ParentQueue.java:116:\n\n{code}\n    if (rootQueue &&\n        (rawCapacity != CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_VALUE)) {\n      throw new IllegalArgumentException(\"Illegal \" +\n          \"capacity of \" + rawCapacity + \" for queue \" + queueName +\n          \". Must be \" + CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.MAXIMUM_CAPACITY_VALUE);\n    }\n{code}\n\nHowever, I think we shouldn't overwrite a configuration given by the user, we can just provide the correct default if it is missing. \n\nOverwriting a configuration can have a negative consequence of having a configuration file contents which contradicts what is really used by the scheduler, which is problematic.\n\nUsing the latest patch, if the user sets the root capacity to a wrong value, then the system will throw an Exception, and the user will know it is wrong and correct it. But if the user misses it, the default will be picked. This is why I changed to {{&&}}.
