Can we not get RawLocalFileSystem to automatically use native fstat if the native library is available? That way all users can simply benefit from this seamlessly.\n\nThat's an interesting idea.  Looking at this more closely, {{ResourceLocalizationService#checkLocalDir}} really can't use the existing {{NativeIO.POSIX#getFstat}} method anyway.  That one is a passthrough to {{fstat}}, which operates on an open file descriptor.  Instead, {{ResourceLocalizationService#checkLocalDir}} really wants plain {{stat}} or maybe {{lstat}}, which operates on a path string.  Forcing this code path to open the file just for the sake of passing an fd to {{fstat}} isn't ideal.\n\nLet's try it!  I filed HADOOP-11935 as a pre-requisite to do the Hadoop Common work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-07T16:36:40.374+0000","updated":"2015-05-07T16:36:40.374+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12824387/comment/14585365","id":"14585365","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"thanks [~vinodkv] and [~cnauroth]! it makes sense to do the optimization at {{loadPermissionInfo}}, so all users can benefit from it.\nI did some profiling and I find It can speed up 3-4x using NativeIO.POSIX. {{checkLocalDir}} takes about 15ms with shell-based implementation currently, it only takes about 4 ms using NativeIO.POSIX.
