Also RM keeps tracks of running containers here and the idea is to keep information about completed containers in ATS/AHS UI. When application is finished/running, ATS UI is capable of giving detailed information about the application (containers info also).

I could remember an old JIRA YARN-1809, where UI is made similar for RM and HistoryServer.\nHere we use {{getContainers)), where History/Timeline fills containers info from ApplicationContext (has all container info). But RM was taking from RMContext where only live containers are taken. I understood the need of killed containers here. it can help in debugging. However we have to segregate killed/preempted containers from completed containers. \n\nHi [~leftnoteasy]\nI also feel that we can have the information about killed/preempted container along with running containers in app attempt UI. In YARN-1809, we added for only running containers. Could you pls share your thoughts here.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-23T18:04:19.452+0000","updated":"2015-09-23T18:04:19.452+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828406/comment/15038101","id":"15038101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think this patch  has gone stale and I feel we can move this ticket forward.\n[~rohithsharma] / [~xgong] / [~tgraves] Could you please help to check the screen shots attached and see if its a good addition.\n\nAlso would like to propose one point which got discussed with Jeff about killed container.
