I reviewed this patch, and it looks good to me. Specifically, I agree that we can treat nulls from old data equal to DEFAULT_DOMAIN in new data, by masking them during read out time. The special design for related entity in level db store is fine because only entities stored in level db will face this problem (any persistent data storage needs to consider domains afterwards). \n\nI noticed that you've added several tests. I think they look good for now. In future if we're adding support to hbase or something else, we may want to share some of our existing tests like {{testRelatingToNonExistingEntity}}. \n\nIn conclusion, patch LGTM.
