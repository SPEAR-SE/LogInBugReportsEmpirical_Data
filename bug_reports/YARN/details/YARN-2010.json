I ll try to consolidate everything here so we can iterate on this quickly.\n\nSometimes, the RM fails to recover an application. It could be because of turning security on, token expiry, or issues connecting to HDFS etc. The causes could be classified into (1) transient, (2) specific to one application, and (3) permanent and apply to multiple (all) applications. Today, the RM fails to transition to Active and ends up in STOPPED state and can never be transitioned to Active again. \n\nVinod suggested we handle these cases (exceptions) separately, so we can do the right thing for each exception. The latest patch (v4) is along these lines - it catches a potentially transient issue (ConnectException) and transitions the RM to Standby. If the issue were to persist (case - 3), the RM would eventually run out of number of failovers and crash. For application-specific issues (as of now, all other exceptions), we just skip recovering that app.\n\nIn addition to this, the patch cleans up RMAppManager#recoverApplication and also adds a null-check in RMAppAttempt#recoverAppAttemptCredentials per Jian's suggestion.

For the purpose of this jira, we don't need the following change, since the problem of {{Any subsequent attempts to transition the RM to active fail because RMActiveServices is not INITED, as in the Standby case}} is already fixed in YARN-2588\n{code}\n        // Unable to connect to HDFS or ZK.
