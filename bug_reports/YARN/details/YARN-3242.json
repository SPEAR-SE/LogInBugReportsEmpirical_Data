So the watcher event from old ZK client session which just is closed will still be processed.\nFor example, If a Disconnected event received from old session after new session is connected, the zkClient will be set to null\n{code}\n        case Disconnected:\n          LOG.info(\"ZKRMStateStore Session disconnected\");\n          oldZkClient = zkClient;\n          zkClient = null;\n          break;\n{code}\nThen ZKRMStateStore won't receive SyncConnected event from new session because new session is already in SyncConnected state and it won't send SyncConnected event until it is disconnected and connected again.\nThen we will see all the ZKRMStateStore operations fail with IOException \"Wait for ZKClient creation timed out\" until  RM shutdown.\n\nThe following code from zookeeper(ClientCnxn#EventThread) show even after receive eventOfDeath, EventThread will still process all the events until  waitingEvents queue is empty.\n{code}\n              while (true) {\n

It is just the way ZooKeeper is implemented. This implementation need the client side to maintain each client session separately even after ZooKeeper close is called. In this way, you can close the ZooKeeper quickly without waiting for all these events processed.\nThe ZooKeeper implementation can be improved definitely. Even suppose no more watched events after ZooKeeper close, there may be still some race condition to solve if process watched event is called at the same time as ZooKeeper close.\nI also talked with some zookeeper guy, he said the ZooKeeper code base is pretty stable, there may not be any big change like this one.\nthanks\nzhihai","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-04T04:27:32.991+0000","updated":"2015-03-04T04:27:32.991+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776685/comment/14346469","id":"14346469","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Thanks for detailed explanation.
