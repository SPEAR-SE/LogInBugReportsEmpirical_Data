For the null case(where the WebAppUtils.getPassword() returns null), should we add a warning or an audit log that someone was trying to get a password that was null?\n\nThere was no such log or audit record in that case before adding the additional check for an alias in credential provider - so I didn't add anything new for it. It probably would be a good idea to do so - I don't know that this change makes it any more necessary though. Your question raises an interesting point for the Configuration.getPassword implementation though. I think that it would make sense to log a failure to get a password if there is no provisioned alias and it is configured to not allow fallback to config. We don't currently do that - it will just return null. I think we should file a separate jira for that.\n\nbq. 2. Will you update documentation in another ticket(just to let users know that they can use a CredentialProvider instead of using plain text)?\n\nWe could do that. There is a jira for adding credential provider api documentation already are you thinking that it needs to have YARN specific documentation as well?\n\nbq. Missed one more question - are you taking care of changes to ssl-client.xml as well?\n\nThis is a good point. I will have to track down those usages as well and file separate jiras.\n\n\nAre any of these questions/answers blockers for this patch?\n\nThanks again for the review!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-08-08T15:01:52.446+0000","updated":"2014-08-08T15:01:52.446+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12730873/comment/14091793","id":"14091793","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Hi [~vvasudev] - if you are okay with follow up jiras for this patch for docs and ssl-client.xml can you commit this to trunk and branch-2?\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lmccay","name":"lmccay","key":"lmccay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lmccay&avatarId=16811"},"displayName":"Larry McCay","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-08-09T15:17:17.205+0000","updated":"2014-08-09T15:17:17.205+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12730873/comment/14092714","id":"14092714","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~lmccay] none of those should be a blocker.
