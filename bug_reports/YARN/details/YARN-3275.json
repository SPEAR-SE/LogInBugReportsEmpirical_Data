But child queue can only go beyond max capacity when cluster resource reduced.\n{quote}\nIt is possible that the total available capacity of the cluster dropped by some percentage, causing the leaf node to go over its abs max cap by 5%. The cluster has a large number of nodes and memory, and that value is always changing slightly as nodes are lost and re-register. This may not account for the 5% overage we saw on the small leaf queue, because that total memory number isn't varying by 5%.\n{quote}\nwe haven't defined \"disable-preemption\" is more important than \"max-capacity\". IMO, if we should do this JIRA or not is still discussable.\n{quote}\nI see your point. In other words, it could be argued that the preemption monitor is doing the right thing. That is, when it sees that the queue is over its absolute max capacity (which should not happen), the preemption monitor is moving those resources back into the usable pool.\n\nHowever, the expectation of our users is that if they are running a job on a non-preemptable queue, their containers should never be preempted. From their point of view, it doesn't matter what the reason is, they are expecting the RM to obey the contract that says it will not preempt their resources.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-02-28T16:26:19.996+0000","updated":"2015-02-28T16:26:19.996+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12778242/comment/14345290","id":"14345290","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks for the patch, Eric!\n\nbq. the expectation of our users is that if they are running a job on a non-preemptable queue, their containers should never be preempted.\n\nI completely agree with this.  IMHO the whole point of the preemption disable feature is to guarantee a queue marked as such will never be preempted.  It's as if the entire preemption feature was turned off from that queue's perspective.\n\nLooking at the patch, I'm a bit worried about this part:\n\n{code}\n+      Resource absMaxCapIdealAssignedDelta = Resource.newInstance(0, 0);\n+      if (Resources.greaterThanOrEqual(\n+                        rc, clusterResource, maxCapacity, idealAssigned)) {\n+        absMaxCapIdealAssignedDelta = Resources.subtract(maxCapacity, idealAssigned);\n+      }\n{code}\n\nIf the intent of this calculation is to guarantee none of the components of absMaxCapIdealAssignedDelta are negative then I don't believe this accomplishes that goal.  I believe it's possible for Resources.greaterThanOrEqual to return true yet subtracting the values will result in one of the components to be negative.  For example, what if both resources are memory dominant, maxCapacity has more memory than idealAssigned, but the opposite is true for vcores?  Subtracting idealAssigned from maxCapacity will result in a positive memory component but a negative vcore component.  If we need to make sure neither component goes negative then I think we need to do a component-wise max with the zero resource rather than a comparision.\n\nAlso one style nit: we normally don't do one-liner conditionals without braces, so I'd like to see the continue explicitly put in a block.  It might be useful to put a debug log statement with the continue to note that we wanted to preempt this queue for some reason (and by how much) but it was marked with preemption disabled.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-03-03T16:32:00.881+0000","updated":"2015-03-03T16:32:00.881+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12778242/comment/14347670","id":"14347670","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~jlowe] and [~leftnoteasy], thank you for the reviews.\n\nAttached is an updated patch (v2) with your suggested changes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-03-04T22:20:33.674+0000","updated":"2015-03-04T22:20:33.674+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12778242/comment/14347803","id":"14347803","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
