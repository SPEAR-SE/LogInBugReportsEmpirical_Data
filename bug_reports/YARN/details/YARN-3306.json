The first case is to support additional container assignment and preemption types to fifo for applications in the capacity scheduler and potentially the fair scheduler using the same code, but this is expected to be expanded to cover queue relationships and potentially other behaviors (limits, etc) over time.\n\nThe hope is that this allows us to iterate toward a state where the various behaviors of the schedulers can be mixed, matched, and shared across implementations rather than having to try and accomplish this all in one go, and allows us to achieve the benefit of mixing and matching some of the features earlier/along the way.\n\nI suspect that at some point we'll hit a critical mass where enough of the functionality has been extracted to sharable components and where we've been able to establish an understanding of how these can be made to compose well, and then we'll take that as an inflection point and go down the path you are suggesting, introduce a new scheduler to house the policies and in that way complete the picture, deprecating the others.  That's by no means the only possible conclusion, but it seems to be a good and/or  likely one.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-13T17:03:51.024+0000","updated":"2015-03-13T17:03:51.024+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12780548/comment/14360697","id":"14360697","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~cwelch] - thanks for the clarifications.
