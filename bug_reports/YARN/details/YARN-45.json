Individual allocations of containers must be reclaimed- or reserved- to restore the global invariants when cluster load shifts. In some cases, the ApplicationMaster can respond to fluctuations in resource availability without losing the work already completed by that task (MAPREDUCE-4584). Supplying it with this information would be helpful for overall cluster utilization [1]. To this end, we want to establish a protocol for the RM to ask the AM to release containers.\n\n[1]

A separate kill-based mechanism already exists (leveraged by the FairScheduler for its preemption) to forcibly recover containers.\nThis is our fallback if the AM does not release containers in a certain amount of time (note that due to the quickly evolving conditions of the cluster we might not kill a container if at a later time we realize this is not strictly needed to achieve fairness/capacity). This means an AM can be written completely ignoring preemption hints, and would work correctly (although it might waste useful work).\n\nThe goal is to allow for smart local policies in the AM, which leverage application-level understanding of the ongoing computation to face the imminent reduction of resources (e.g., by saving the state of the computation to a checkpoint, by promoting partial output, by migrating competencies to other tasks, by try to complete the work quickly). The goal is to spare the RM from understanding application-level optimization concerns but rather focus on resource management issues. As a consequence we envision (among others) preemption requests that are not fully bounded, allowing the AM to leverage some flexibility. Note that the significant \"lag\"  imposed by the heartbeat protocols between RM-AM and AM-Tasks and NM-RM force us to consider in most cases preemption actions to be limited to a rather long time horizon. We can't expect to operate in a tight sub-second control loop, but rather trigger changes in the cluster allocation in the orders of tens of seconds. As a consequence preemption should be used to correct macroscopic issues that are likely to be somewhat stable over time, rather than micro-managing container allocations.\n\nWe consider the following use cases for preemption: \n# Scheduling policies aimed at rebalancing some global property such as capacity or fairness. This allows to go for example over capacity on a queue and get resources back as the cluster conditions change. \n# Scheduling policies that are making point decisions about individual containers (e.g., preempt a container on a machine and restart it elsewhere to improve data locality, or preempting containers on a box that is observing excessive IOs).\n# Administrative actions that are aimed at modifying the cluster allocations without wasting work (e.g., draining a machine or a rack before taking it offline for maintenance), manually reducing allocations for a job, etc.\n\nUse cases 1 and 3 can be implemented by picking containers at the RM, or by expressing a \"broad\" request of a certain amount of resources (we reuse the ResourceRequest for this, in a way that is symmetric to the AM request) and let the AM to bound this to specific containers. While use case 2 is more likely to be implemented using ContainerIDs.\n\n\n\nProtocol change proposal:\n\nOur proposal consists in extending the ResourceResponse with a PreemptRequest message (further extensible in the future) that contains a Set<ContainerId> and a Set<ResourceRequest>.  The current semantics is that these two sets are non-overlapping (i.e., if I ask for a specific container and a ResourceRequest the AM is supposed to satisfy both). Once again, as we never rely on the AM to \"enforce\" preemption but we have a kill-based fallback, the AM implementation is not required to understand the preemption requests (nor even acknowledging their receiving). This make for an simple upgrade story and one could run mixed preemption-aware and not-preemption-aware AMs on the same cluster. \n\nA current open question we would like input on is whether to have the PreemptRequest to be a union-type where we have either sets (but not both together), or whether to allow, as we do in the attached patch, for both to co-exists in the same PreemptRequest. We do not have a current need for the \"both\" use case, but maybe others do. thoughts?\n\n\n\nComing up next:\n\nWe are cleaning up further patches to the FairScheduler, CapacityScheduler and ApplicationMasterService leveraging this AM-RM protocol, and changes to the mapreduce AM that implements work-saving preemption via checkpointing for Shuffle and Reducers (while for Mappers we are currently \"making a run for it\" given the commonly short runtime of maps). The other patches will be posted soon. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-04-09T02:28:50.131+0000","updated":"2013-04-09T02:28:50.131+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13626162","id":"13626162","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I think what you propose is akin to the Set<ResourceRequest> we have (which is similar if I understand correctly to the PreemptResource thing you describe). We plan to support this, and it does cover one set of use cases very well, i.e., when we have a \"broad\" request and we are ok with the AM resolving this as it see fit. As you point out this is good because it allows the AM to be smart about what to return and thus more likely to save expensive preemptions in favor of cheap ones, or even return a container which is not data-local in place of one that is data-local etc... \n\nHowever, this feels contrived when we know precisely what we want back from a certain AM (e.g., we want to preempt a specific container). To this purpose the Set<ContainerID> -based preemption is easier to use, and also simplifies the bookeeping done in the RM (in our preemption policy), to decide when to \"kill\" a container if the AM does not preempt it within a certain timeout. This is a good match with the FairScheduler internals and we adapted CapacityScheduler to leverage this too by means of a preemption monitor.  This will be more clear when we release the actual monitor (in the next few days) but the idea is that if we talk to the AM in terms of a Set<ContainerID> there is no ambiguity to detect when the AM is ignoring us, and thus we have to move on with container killing (e.g., to enforce capacity/fairness).  On the contrary using ResourceRequest or something like that, we might not know whether the resource I want back now is the same I wanted in some previous iteration (hence i am being ignored by the AM) or they just happen to be the same/similar. \n\nIf we can devise a simple way to leverage a single resource-based representation for both scenarios I would be happy to drop the Set<ContainerID>, but so far we haven't found a clean way to do it, so we provisioned for both Set<ResourceRequest> and/or Set<ContainerID> to be optionally part of a PreemptRequest. The current semantic is that these are disjoint sets of resources we want (some called-out as containers, and some expressed as resources), but we don't have a strong reason for this not to be a tagged union.\n\nDo you think the above covers the use case you have in mind or am I missing something? (BTW I am very curious to hear what's your use case).\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-04-10T21:45:37.787+0000","updated":"2013-04-10T21:45:37.787+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13628358","id":"13628358","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Carlo, I may be missing something then.\n\nFrom your description I'm understanding that a PreemptRequest could contain either Set<ContainerID> or Set<ResourceRequest> but not both.\n\nIf I'm correct with this assumption, then if the RM chooses to send Set<ContainerID> then  we are back to square one where the RM is deciding what to kill, it just giving a heads up.\n\nIf the idea is that the RM will send PreemptRequest containing both Set<ContainerID> and Set<ResourceRequest> which are equivalent (just 2 ways of expressing the same amount of resources), then it seems OK.

We can see three possible uses of preemption:\n\n1) A preemption policy that does not necessarily trust the AM, picks containers and list them as a Set<ContainerID>, and give the AM a heads up on who is going to die soon if it is not preempted. Note that If the AM is mapreduce this is not too bad as we know how containers are used (maps before reducers) and so we can pick containers in a reasonable order. We have been testing a policy that does this, and works well in our tests. Also this is a perfect match with how the FairScheduler thinks about preemption.\n\n2) A preemption policy that trusts the AM and specifies preemption  as a Set<ResourceRequest>. This works well for known AMs that we know try to enforce the preemption requests, and/or if we do not care to force-killing anyway and preemption requests are best-effort. We have played around with a version of this too. If I am not mistaken this is also the case you care the most about, right?\n\n3) A version of 2 which also enforces its preemption-requests via killing if they are not satisfied within a certain period of time. This is not-trivial to build as there is inherent ambiguity of how ResourceRequest are mapped to containers over-time, so the enforcement part is hard to get right / prove correctness for. \n\nWe believe that 3 might be the ideal point of tendency but proving its correctness is non-trivial and would require deeper surgery to the RM/Schedulers, for example if in subsequent moment in time I want the same amount of resources out of an AM it is hard to unambiguously decide whether is due to an AM not preempting as I asked (just forcibly killing its containers is fine), or whether this are subsequent and independent request of resources (so I should not kill but wait).\n\nThe proposed protocol, with the change that makes it a tagged union of Set<ContainerID> and Set<ResourceRequest> seems to allow for all of the above, and be easy to explain.

If the AM fullfils the preemption only partially, then the RM will still kill some containers from the set.\n\nAs the set is not ordered, still it is not known to the AM what containers will exactly be killed. So the set is just the list of containers in danger of being preempted.\n\nI may be backtracking a bit on my previous comments, 'trading these containers for equivalent ones' seems acceptable and gives the scheduler some freedom on how to best take care of things if an AM is over limit. If an AM releases the requested amount of resources, regardless of what containers releases, the AM won't be preempted for this preemption message.

However, I am wary of having the action taken in different places. eg. the KILL to the containers should come from the RM or the AM exclusively but not from both. Otherwise we open ourselves up to race conditions, unnecessary kills and complex logic in the RM.\n\nPreemption is something that, IMO the RM needs to do at the very last moment when there is no other alternative of resource being freed up. If we decide to preempt at time T1 and then actually preempt at time T2 then the cluster conditions may have changed between T1 and T2 which may invalidate the decisions taken at T1. New resources may have freed up that reduce the number of containers to be killed. This sub-optimality is directly proportional to length of time between T1 and T2. So ideally we want to keep T1=T2. One can argue that things can change after the preemption which may have made the preemption unnecessary. So the above argument of T1=T2 is fallacious. However, preemption policies are usually based on deadlines such as the allocation of queue1 must be met within X seconds. So RM does not have the luxury of waiting for X+1 seconds. The best it can do is to wait upto X seconds in the hope that things will work out and at X redistribute resources to meet the deficit.\n\nAt the same time, I can see that there is an argument that the AM knows best how to free up its resources. It will be good to remember that the AM has already informed the RM about the importance of all its containers when it made the requests at different priorities. So the RM knows the order of importance of the containers and the RM also knows the amount of time each container has been allocated. Assuming container runtime as a proxy for container work done, this data can be used by the RM to preempt in a work preserving manner without having to talk to the AM.\n\nNotifying the AM has the usefulness of allowing the AM to take actions that preserve work such as checkpointing. However, IMO, the AM should only do checkpointing operations but not kill the containers. That should still happen at the RM as the very last option at the last moment. If the situation changes in the grace period and the containers do not need to be killed then there is no point in the AM killing them right now. This also lets us increase the grace period to a longer time because checkpointing and preserving work usually means persisting data in a stable store and may be slow in practical scenarios.\n\nTo summarize, I would propose an API in which the RM tells the AM about exactly which containers it might imminently preempt with the contract being that the AM could take actions to preserve the work done in those containers. The AM can continue to run those containers until the RM actually preempts them if needed. If we really think that the choice of containers needs to be made at the AM then the AM needs to checkpoint those containers and inform the RM about the containers it has chosen. But the final decision to send the kill must be sent by the RM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-12T23:50:31.235+0000","updated":"2013-04-12T23:50:31.235+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13630893","id":"13630893","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~sandyr]: Yes, but the correct format/semantics for time are a complex discussion in themselves. To keep this easy to review and the discussion focused, we were going to file that separately. But I totally agree: for the AM to respond intelligently, the time before it's forced to give up the container is valuable input.\n\n[~bikash]: Agree almost completely. In YARN-569, the hysteresis you cite motivated several design points, including multiple dampers on actions taken by the preemption policy, out-of-band observation/enforcement, and no effort to fine-tune particular allocations. The role of preemption (to summarize what [~curino] discussed in detail in the prenominate JIRA) is to make coarse corrections around the core scheduler invariants (e.g., capacity, fairness). Rather than introducing new races or complexity, one could argue that preemption is a dual of allocation in an inconsistent environment.\n\nYour proposal matches case (1) in the above [comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-45?focusedCommentId=13628950&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13628950], where the RM specifies the set of containers in jeopardy and a contract (as {{ResourceRequest}}) for avoiding the kills, should the AM have cause to pick different containers. Further, your observation that the RM has enough information in priorities, etc. to make an educated guess at those containers is spot-on. IIRC, the policy uses allocation order when selecting containers, but that should be a secondary key after priority.\n\nThe disputed point, and I'm not sure we actually disagree, is the claim that the AM should never kill things in response to this message. To be fair, that can be implemented by just ignoring the requests, so it's orthogonal to this particular protocol, but it's certainly an important \"best practice\" to discuss to ensure we're capturing the right thing. Certainly there are many cases where ignoring the message is correct; most CDFs of map task execution time show that over 80% finish in less than a minute, so the AM has few reasons to pessimistically kill them.\n\nThere are a few scenarios where this isn't optimal. Take the case of YARN-415, where the AM is billed cumulatively for cluster time. Assume an AM knows (a) the container will not finish (reinforcing [~sandyr]'s point about including time in the preemption message) and (b) the work done is not worth checkpointing. It can conclude that killing the container is in its best interest, because squatting on the resource could affect its ability to get containers in the future (or simply cost more). Moreover, for long-lived services and speculative container allocation/retention, the AM may actually be holding the container only as an optimization or for a future execution, so it could release it at low cost to itself. Finally, the time allowed before the RM starts killing containers can be extended if AMs typically return resources before the deadline.\n\nIt's also a mechanism for the RM to advise the AM about constraints that prevent it from granting its pending requests. The AM currently kills reducers if it can't get containers to regenerate lost map output. If the scheduler values some containers more than others, the AM's response to starvation can be improved from random killing. This is a case where the current implementation acknowledges the fact that it already runs in an inconsistent environment.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-13T02:43:58.368+0000","updated":"2013-04-13T02:43:58.368+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13630898","id":"13630898","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"As you pointed out, any decision made in the RM needs to deal with an inconsistent and evolving view of the world, and the preemption actions suffer from an inherent and significant lag. In designing policies around this, one must embrace such chaos and operate conservatively and try to affect only macroscopic properties (hence the many built-in dampers Chris mentioned). \n\nAs for what to do with the preemption requests, I think we are quite aligned with your comments in our current implementation for the mapreduce AM/Task. \n\nHere's what we do:\n1) Maps are typically short-lived, so it is often worth ignoring the preemption request and try to \"make a run for it\", as checkpointing and completion times risk to be comparable, and re-execution costs are low. \n\n2) For reducer, since the state is valuable and runtimes often longer, the AM asks the task to checkpoint. In our current implementation, once the state of the reducer has been saved to a checkpoint we exit, as continuing execution is non-trivial (in particular managing partial output of reducers).  I can envision a future version that tries to continue running after having taken a checkpoint. \nNote that this (the task exiting) does not introduce any new race-condition/complexity in either RM or AM, as both already handle failing/killed tasks, and the AM even have logic to kill its own reducers to free up space for maps.  \nMore importantly, this setup (in which containers exit as soon as they are done checkpointing) allows us to set rather generous \"wait-before-kill\" parameters, since the containers will be reclaimed as soon as the task is done checkpointing anyway. \nThe alternative would have the RM pick a static policy for waiting, which risks to be either too long (hence delaying by too much the rebalancing), or too short (which risks to interrupt containers while finishing the checkpointing thus wasting work). I expect that no static solution would fair well for a broad range of AMs and job sizes. \n\n3) When the preemption takes the form of a ResourceRequest we pick reducers over maps (as having reducers running when the map are killed would simply lead to wasted slot time). Looking forward in Yarn's future this is a key feature as other applications might have evolving priorities for containers which are not exposed to the RM, hence we can't rely on the RM to guess which container is best to preempt, and delegating the choice to the AM could be invaluable.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-04-13T02:56:13.097+0000","updated":"2013-04-13T02:56:13.097+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13630925","id":"13630925","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Comments on the patch. \n\n* Reusing ResourceRequest means we have a bunch of properties that are not applicable to the preempt message.

In particular it allows to: 1) list large number of containers compactly, 2) allows to express locality preferences, and 3) allows to express priority among multiple requests. While we don't make use of 3 quite yet it seems not bad to have. Arguably, at least portion of this information can indeed be reconstructed from a Set<ContainerID> + a tag, but this might force the RM to do extra work, build a potentially large list of containers, just to have the AM undo all that. \n\nSymmetrically one can imagine to use only Set<ResourceRequest> and if the RM wants exactly a container back, it can try to constraint the request so that only the desired container matches. In this case too it is easy to provide examples in which this might be awkward to use. \n\nWe discussed with Chris this a fair bit, and it seems that the set of use cases which are important to cover are not quite fully served by Set<ContainerID> alone nor by Set<ResourceRequeust>, hence the proposal including both. \n\nI would say this comes down almost to a \"style\" choice, we could build a protocol that is likely to accommodate most of the future uses we foresee now and try (likely to be more stable), or define a minimal protocol that covers just the first use case we are targeting (Set<ContainerID> would be it in this case), and evolve it whenever needed.

ResourceRequest is not actionable in the sense that neither of the schedulers can currently send a non-empty ResourceRequest to preempt. Both only do preemption by containers though they have some plumbing to send RR's if they want to do so. So I am not quite sure what you mean by \"We indeed have code that exercises the ResourceRequest version of it\".\n\nA prototype impl against MapReduce responds to {{ResourceRequest}} in the preempt message. We're currently polishing and splitting that up for review, but wanted to get consensus on the Yarn changes in case new requirements required reworking the rest.\n\nAn RM impl that includes killing for {{ResourceRequest}} (or {{Resource}}) is a more invasive change, particularly because (a) the AM needs to reason about which recently finished containers are included in the message (i.e., it needs to reason about what the RM knows, so the RM needs to be consistent in what it tells the AM) and (b) the RM needs to track its previous preemption requests, timing them out in the context of existing allocations and exited containers (i.e., decisions to preempt need to incorporate subsequent information).\n\nTo get experience before proposing anything drastic, we marked this API as experimental, wrote the enforcement policy against {{ContainerID}}, and tucked it behind a pluggable interface. This way, the AM can ignore stale requests for exited containers and the RM can time out particular containers it asked for easily; every computed preemption set is bound in a namespace that sidesteps the most disruptive impl issues on both sides.\n\nbq.  By not using location we are implicitly using the \"*\" location right? Might as well make it explicit. Non * locations will make sense when affinity based preemptions occur.\n\nYes, that's exactly the intent. The policy in YARN-569 doesn't attempt to bias the preemptions to match the requests in under-capacity queues, but that's a natural policy to implement against this protocol.\n\n{quote}\nThe bare-minimum requirement seems:\n\n# RM should notify the AM that a certain amount of resources will need to be reclaimed (ala SIGTERM).\n# Thus, the AM gets an opportunity to *pick* which containers it will sacrifice to satisfy the RM's requirements.\n# Iff the AM doesn't act, the RM will go ahead and terminate some containers (probably the most-recently allocated ones); ala SIGKILL.\n\nGiven the above, I feel that this is a set of changes we need to be conservative about - particularly since the really simple pre-emption i.e. SIGKILL alone on RM side is trivial (from an API perspective).\n{quote}\n\nTotally agreed. The symmetry of {{ResourceRequest}} in the ask-back is attractive, but it's not a sufficient condition. To it, I'd add all the familiar attributes of using them in allocation requests (economy, expressiveness, versatility). While {{Resource}} covers the current impl, it leaves little room for related improvements, or even refinements (e.g., preferring resources requested by under-capacity queues, prioritizing types of containers, and time).\n\nThe API isn't that complex, but a strict implementation would change the RM more, adding risk. To mitigate that, but still encourage applications to write against the richer type while we get experience with it, [~curino]'s formulation [above|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-45?focusedCommentId=13628950&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13628950] seems like a decent set of semantics...\n\nWe could add a new type that encodes a subset of the {{ResourceRequest}} type. It lacks symmetry, but it also allows them to evolve independently.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-16T06:54:48.638+0000","updated":"2013-04-16T06:54:48.638+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13638783","id":"13638783","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Updated the protocol patch (and the implementation for capacity scheduler), to reflect the discussion in the above comments (plus various offline conversations).  The current proposal is a minimal protocol change and compact policies, which capture the portion of our initial proposal on which we reached reasonable consensus. \n\nThe key change is the following:\n# Simplified the protocol modification to include only Set<ContainerID> as vehicle to express preemption requests.\n# Modified ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy to select containers by reversed priority, and within each priority by reversed container id (reflects order of allocation). \n# Simplified all the \"pipes\" in the RM that propagated decisions about preemption around (to not-include resource-based preemptions). \n\nThe decision is based on the following rationale: \nThere seems to be agreement on the fact that ResourceRequest -based preemption is appealing due to: symmetry, compactness, and the flexibility it provides to the AM. \nHowever, the declarative nature of the specification makes the \"tracking\" over time quite tricky. In particular, both RM and AMs must be capable of maintain some form of history of the resources being requested: \n# for the RM, consciously preempt containers only for the fraction of resources that have been consistently asked to the AM over time (a notion of ResourceRequest intersection should be defined),  \n# for the AM, to track its own preemption actions, and know when they are received by the RM (this is needed to discount the RM requests while the task are being check pointed).\n\nWith [~chris.douglas] we worked out a possible set of semantics for the above and started to work on a version of the ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy that reflects those. While they seem reasonable are likely to generate longer (speculative) discussions. \n\nSo following the spirit of [~acmurthy]'s last comment and after feedback from [~tucu00], [~bikassaha], [~vinodkv], [~sseth], [~hitesh] we propose Set<ContainerID> as an initial strategy that will allow us to: \n# observe most of the benefits of preemption, \n# gain experience in running schedulers leveraging preemption. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=curino","name":"curino","key":"curino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=curino&avatarId=21704"},"displayName":"Carlo Curino","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-04-23T05:03:13.329+0000","updated":"2013-04-23T05:03:13.329+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13638814","id":"13638814","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Thanks a bunch for doing this!\n\nCarlo, may I ask you to summarize the various pros and cons of a container-list API vs a resource-request-list API and a combination of both. There seems to lot of back and forth and a clear summary of the both sides will let us and others in future reason out why this API is written so. Can happen in parallel, as I am fine with putting the container-list API for now. Some kind of API design doc. Tx.\n\nComing to the patch, I'd like to get this in for 2.0.5-beta and let the underlying implementation take its own time - that way we won't have API breakage beyond 2.0.5-beta.\n\nI'll also look at this in the context of the related tickets this weekend.\n\nSome comments on the patch though:\n - Can you remove the helper methods addAllContainers(), addContainer() and clearContainers() from PreemptMessage? We had these earlier in other records, but removed them as they turned into maintenance headaches - a simple setContainerList and getContainerList should suffice.\n - Also, can you change BuilderUtils.newAllocateResponse() to take in a pre-empt message as a parameter? It is okay to break this API for now - as we are targeting stable API for 2.0.5.

In fact, by design the RM will \"sustain\" its asks until either: 1) the need for those resources is gone, 2) the containers are released (natural or AM-initiated completion), or 3) a timeout expires and the RM force-kill the containers. The possible overlap among subsequent messages is not a big concern on the AM side given our choice of a Set<ContainerID> based PreemptionMessage.  Duplicates are trivial to detect, and/or the AM can simply implement preemption in an idempotent way (which is what we do in our mapreduce solution). \n\nRegarding time, in the basic implementation we have for mapreduce, the AM does not attempt complex speculations on when to preempt, it simply acts on the requests in a idempotent way as soon as they are received (this also maximizes the chance to complete a checkpoint before being killed). In our design we pushed this in an AMPreemptionPolicy, so you can easily imagine more advanced policies to track containers over-time and speculate on when is best to preempt.

We need to allow the AM to make *smarter* choices; either now or later. I just don't want the API to setup the wrong conventions.\n\nI understand that correctly implementing the Resource, Set<CID> is slightly hard. So, I propose we just do a simple impl where-in the RM just maintains the Set<CID> and then sums up the Resource allocated to the Set<CID> and sends it out in the AllocateResponse.\n\nFurthermore, we need to be clear about semantics i.e. Resource represents what the RM actually wants back, the Set<CID> is the RM's intended course of action i.e. the *hint*. Also, [~chris.douglas] pointed out, correctly, that this way the AM could preempt (Resource - sum(non-running containers in Set<CID>)).\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-28T19:46:58.795+0000","updated":"2013-04-28T19:46:58.795+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13644327","id":"13644327","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"My understanding is the the containers being presented in PreemptionMessage are going to be preempted by the RM some time in the near future if the RM cannot find free resources elsewhere. The AM's are not supposed to preempt the containers but they are encourage to checkpoint and save work. The RM can always choose to not preempt these containers and so it would be sub-optimal for the AM to kill these containers.\nIf we want to add additional information besides the set of containers-to-be-preempted then I would prefer ResourceRequest (like it was in the original patch) and not Resource. Not only is that symmetric but also allows the RM to provide additional information about where to free containers. A smarter RM could potentially ask for resources to be preempted where the under-allocated job wants it and a smart AM could help out by choosing containers close to the desired locations. Secondly, Resource is too amorphous by itself. Asking an AM to free 50GB  does not tell it whether the RM needs 10*5 or 50*1. Without that information the AM can end up freeing containers in a manner that does not help the RM to meet the request of the under-allocated job, thus failing to meet quota and wasting work at the same time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-29T07:47:56.097+0000","updated":"2013-04-29T07:47:56.097+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604951/comment/13644626","id":"13644626","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm also a fan of {{ResourceRequest}}, but we're not really using all its features, yet.

This achieves Chris's proposal with a slightly prettier use of ResourceRequest.
