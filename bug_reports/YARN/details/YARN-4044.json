But current V1 GUI doesnt have support to display all changed entities of application in UI. I discussed with [~jianhe] also offline. As per our discussion, we need not need to concentrate on showing this changed entities in UI now. It will make current UI complex. In future UI work, we can handle this in a better human readable form (application timelilne graph maybe). However we can have changed events  in YARN level rather than entity overwrite, and we can show last changed event for now. I will update a patch based on this understanding.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-09T17:56:11.716+0000","updated":"2015-09-09T17:56:11.716+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12854195/comment/14737639","id":"14737639","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for the update [~sunilg], \nMy thoughts initially was also same but may be I could have conveyed better, i meant it would good for analysis if atleast if application updates are captured in ATS and my intention was not to show in UI.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-09T21:46:47.177+0000","updated":"2015-09-09T21:46:47.177+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12854195/comment/14745790","id":"14745790","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Uploading a newer version.\n\nAppUpdated changes are now made as a TimeLine event.
