Actually the current apps page provide users the full text search over the app list. Therefore, you can input user/queue to retrieve the sub list of a certain user/queue. Though I understand it's not perfect way as a complete list has to be retrieved anyway, it should meet your basic requirement, shouldn't it? Or you're looking for some thing efficient?\n\n2. Another consideration is that now REST API is providing more filters (including user/queue) than web UI to get applications. Ideally, the two interfaces should have same or equivalent capability of exposing data. Probably you want to think about other filters here as well.\n\n3. I had a quick look at the patch. I didn't see there's an iterative way for users to do the query other than editing url. Did I miss something?\n\n4.

I'm not aware of any REST API does the same thing, can you give me some examples?\n\nYou can  have a look at RMWebServices#getApps. IMO, it's good to add all these filters in one round instead of one after the other, unless different filters really differs a lot in the way they're going to be presented.\n\nbq. 3. For now, users have to edit url, but we can also provide direct link where people can click to get in this page. Moreover, we can automatically take user name and call this new url directly in the future when turning on security.\n\nIt's a good idea that in secured mode, the users login to the apps page that only shows their own app list. However, I still think some interactive method should be provided to users to filter apps, instead of editing URL directly. For example, I'm an Admin, and want to watch the applications from another user.\n\nAnyway, if your use case doesn't care about interaction on web UI, but the app list, the current REST API should already serve you well. Otherwise, we should make web UI more interactive.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-12T22:05:08.052+0000","updated":"2014-02-12T22:05:08.052+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694540/comment/14155700","id":"14155700","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=l201514","name":"l201514","key":"l201514","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siqi Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am all for making the webUI more interactive.
