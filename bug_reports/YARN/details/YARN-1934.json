We should definitely clean it up. Thinking about it, I think we should just have have RMZooKeeper and/or RMFencingZooKeeper classes that extend/wrap ZooKeeper and override the methods we need. That would make the remaining ZK code much easier to read and maintain. Would like to work on this on a separate JIRA target for 2.5.\n\nHaven't added a test in the patch. I am tempted not to, given the intention to cleanup/revamp the ZK interactions.
