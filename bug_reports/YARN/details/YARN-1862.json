I am not sure if it comes from any misconfiguration and I'm not sure if this is the way to ask for help. Would you please give me a hand?

JIRA is for reporting bugs in the code and tracking new features and is not a user support channel.\n\nmapreduce.jobhistory.done-dir is not a per-job property but rather a property used by the job history server.  Attempting to override this property in a job will have no effect.  There currently isn't a way to specify a per-job final destination for job history files.  This would require some additional support in the job history server as it would need a way to locate the corresponding job history files for a given job ID if they could be in arbitrary places for each job.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-01T21:00:40.992+0000","updated":"2014-04-01T21:00:40.992+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-1862/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1tnzz:"}}
