For Apps at New/Init state, we still should not prematurely remove the containers from context.

If they are, we are safe to remove the containers from context.\n- Also, the following code\n{code}\n      if (!this.context.getApplications().containsKey(applicationId)) {\n        context.getContainers().remove(containerId);\n        continue;\n      }\n{code}\n needs to be moved inside the following check {{ if (containerStatus.getState().equals(ContainerState.COMPLETE))}}, so that if app is at one of the states mentioned above, we don't remove containers from the context until container reaches COMPLETE state.
