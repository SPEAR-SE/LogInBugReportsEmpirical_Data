But winutils has features that relate strictly to the nodemanager, namely `winutils task`. Being build under hadoop-common menas that any mvn/pom compile configuration has to be done in the hadoop-common project. For example I wanted to add a configuration file similar to the container-executor cfg, which gets the .cfg location from the ${container-executor.conf.dir} in it's parent pom. But for winutils I would have to add the config to the hadoop-common pom, despite being very specific for the nodemanager use.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Move winutils task related functionality under a yarn-servers-nodemanager project","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rusanu","name":"rusanu","key":"rusanu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791"},"displayName":"Remus Rusanu","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Bucharest"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rusanu","name":"rusanu","key":"rusanu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rusanu&avatarId=16791"},"displayName":"Remus Rusanu","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Bucharest"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-2439/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1z7yv:"}}
