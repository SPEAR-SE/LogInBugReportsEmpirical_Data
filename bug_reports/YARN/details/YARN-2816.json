If something comes along and deletes (i.e.: corrupts) the leveldb database then in general the NM will not be able to recover properly.  Trying to patch up one particular scenario won't cover the rest, and containers could \"leak\" (i.e.: be forgotten even though they're still running), container start requests lost, etc.\n\nAs for the OS crash scenario, if the OS crashes then there's nothing left for the NM to recover.  If we really want to protect against OS crashes then a much better way is to perform synchronous writes to leveldb.  However this is _much_ slower than asynchronous writes and could easily impact NM performance.  Given that there's nothing to recover from the OS crash scenario, it doesn't seem worth worrying about that case.\n\nThe real issue for the reported scenario is that the leveldb database location is a poor one for the way that system is configured, since something is coming along and corrupting the database.  Either the leveldb database needs to be moved somewhere else or the file cleanup procedure needs to exclude the leveldb database.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-11-06T14:41:11.708+0000","updated":"2014-11-06T14:41:11.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753276/comment/14201020","id":"14201020","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jlowe], thanks for the review,\nBased on your comment, it look like the the issue is not as serious as what I thought previously, I lowered the issue from Critical to Major.\nmove the levelDB database location from /tmp directory to other safe directory is a very good suggestion.\n\nBut I still think the patch is good for better error handling and NM recovery.\n\n1. If an OS crash will cause a few partially written log record in the levelDB, we can't restart the NM due to NPE.\nTo restart the NM, we need manually delete all these stateStore files. I think it will be bad for the user.\nAlso with the patch, we still can recover most of the containers in the NM instead of losing all these container information, which will cause all these containers to be reallocated by RM.\n\n2. The patch is to delete all these containers which don't have container start requests. It won't cause containers leaks. Because container start request is always the first entry to store(startContainerInternal) in the levelDB for each container records and it is always the first entry to remove (removeContainer) in the levelDB for each container records. Also when I debugged this problem, the levelDB stored most latest records in a LRU cache(memory), when the levelDB is closed, it will store these latest records from cache to the disk and our use case for levelDB is always to write key-value record and no read after NM initialization. The data record lost on disk will always the old record, so container start request record is more likely lost than other container records. This makes the patch meaningful for our use case.\nI attached a LevelDB container key record which has this issue.\n\n3. Missing containers record is not a problem if we can recover most containers in NM.\nWhen AM calls ContainerManagementProtocol#getContainerStatuses, the NM will put the missing containers in failed requests of GetContainerStatusesResponse, then the AM will notify RM to release these missing containers in ApplicationMasterProtocol#allocate(AllocateRequest.getReleaseList). So the missing containers will be recovered quickly by AM.\nWith the patch, we still can recover all these containers with complete record in levelDB.\nThe less containers we missed to recover, the better.\n\n4. The patch is small and safe, It won't cause any side effect.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-06T21:58:22.401+0000","updated":"2014-11-06T21:58:22.401+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753276/comment/14201025","id":"14201025","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Because container start request is always the first entry to store(startContainerInternal) in the levelDB for each container records and it is always the first entry to remove (removeContainer) in the levelDB for each container records.\n\nI don't understand this statement.  If the start container request is the first record to be lost, what happens if we write the start container request, launch (or maybe don't launch) the container, then restart?  If we lost the container start record but the container had not completed before the restart, didn't we just lose track of it upon recovery?\n\nAnyway this shouldn't make things much worse than the NM failing to start up if this specific instance of database corruption occurs.  I just think we need to realize that there are _many_ other ways the database could be corrupted and this only works around a very specific instance of it.  Comments on the patch:\n\n{noformat}\n+      LOG.info(\"Remove container \" + containerId +\n+          \" with incomplete records\");\n{noformat}\n\nThe above needs to be logged at least at the warn level if not error.  We have very likely leaked a container.  Also the code should do much more than just forget the container and instead look for the pid file, try to kill it if found, and return a recovered container status of killed/lost or something similar.
