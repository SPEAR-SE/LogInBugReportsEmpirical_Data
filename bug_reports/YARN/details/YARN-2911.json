The RM attempts to match the full username of the GetApplications requester against the stored short username to determine if the requester is the owner of the app. In a secure cluster this can fail as the two are not always equivalent. \n\n2) The {{GetApplicationsRequest}} can be used to filter the the set of app returned to be only those which were submitted/owned by a set of users. Once again there is a mismatch here between short/full usernames. Since the client specifies the set of users, theoretically they can pass in a set of short usernames which would makes this feature work in a secure cluster. However, it is not expected that a client will have the correct {{hadoop.security.auth_to_local}} configuration and therefore they can not always be expected to get the correct short usernames.
