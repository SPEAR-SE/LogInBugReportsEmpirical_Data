The previous ordering is better since if you happen to choose something just above its fairShare, after preemption it may go below and cause additional preemption, causing excessive thrashing of resources.\n\nHas been a while since I saw the patch, but would think that it honors the guarantees FairScheduler provides:\n# Resources are preempted from a Schedulable, only if it is above its fairshare.\n# Preempting resources from a Schedulable doesn't take it under its fairshare. In other words, it shouldn't lead to additional preemption. It is possible that its fairshare goes up right after a preemption and triggers additional preemption, but I guess we can't foresee it. \n\nOrdering shouldn't affect correctness of 1 or 2. Ordering does reduce the impact of preemption in case the fairshare increases because another queue goes inactive. \n\n[~asuresh] - could you confirm the patch conforms to the above guarantees? Do we have unittests that check these invariants? Once we identify all the apps we could preempt from, can we order them for efficiency purposes? What would be the cost of such ordering?
