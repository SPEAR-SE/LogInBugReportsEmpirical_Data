Regarding your first point, this is intentional as an initial value for launchTime because it is part of the ApplicationFinishData, as the field will have been set by the time the application has finished.\n\nFor the pendingTime name, isn't the difference between app.getStartTime() and app.getLaunchTime() essentially the same as the difference between when the app is submitted and launched? From what I've seen, the application is registered in the RM very soon after it is submitted. Therefore, pendingTime is describing how long the application was pending before it actually began running, which makes sense in that context. Furthermore, the placement between the start and launch time in both UI's makes it clear what delta it is measuring. Let me know what you think and I'd be curious if anyone else has any thoughts on this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ayousufi","name":"ayousufi","key":"ayousufi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Abdullah Yousufi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-08-29T22:34:20.234+0000","updated":"2017-08-29T22:34:20.234+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097137/comment/16146442","id":"16146442","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m  0s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} patch {color} | {color:red}  0m  6s{color} | {color:red} YARN-7088 does not apply to trunk.

Even if the length of variable a little bigger and if it serves a better readability, i think it might be fine. Could we say \"pendingTimeTillRegistration\" or some thing smaller if possible :)\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2017-08-31T13:36:28.069+0000","updated":"2017-08-31T13:39:00.304+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097137/comment/16150202","id":"16150202","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ayousufi","name":"ayousufi","key":"ayousufi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Abdullah Yousufi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Main change in this patch is that the launch time is actually set to the when the app has launched, and not when it is being registered.

If others feels pendingTime fine, i think i am also good, lets get this in :). I am looping [~rohithsharma] who worked in App Timeout feature if he has some more thoughts.\n\nPlease correct me and update if any definitions are not correct. By the way I have another major query though, during recovery how could we save *launchTime*. We cannot change this value after RM restart as APP may be already running. Recovery might need a relook with respect to launchTime.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2017-09-01T12:36:32.032+0000","updated":"2017-09-01T12:36:32.032+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097137/comment/16150466","id":"16150466","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Adding few more points\n# Its better not to rely on Attempts to update launchTime.

Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~kanwaljeets] for the patch! I have a few questions/comments around the core state machine changes you've made in this patch.\r\n\r\n1)  \r\n{code:java}\r\n private static final class AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition\r\n      extends  RMAppTransition {\r\n    @Override\r\n    public void transition(RMAppImpl app, RMAppEvent event) {\r\n      LOG.info(\"update the launch time\");\r\n      if(app.launchTime == 0) {\r\n        app.launchTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\r\n      }\r\n    }\r\n  }{code}\r\nWe are generating the timestamp when RMAppImpl is notified of the launch. But the correct timestamp should come from RMAppAttemptEventType.LAUNCHED that is generated by AMLauncher. If the event dispatch thread is falling back, there could be a large gap between when RMAppImpl is notified and when the attempt is actually launched.\r\n\r\n2) I see two transitions are added to RMAPPImpl state machine, namely ACCEPTED --> ACCEPTED and RUNNING --> RUNNING upon the new RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED. However, I could not think of the possibility of receiving a ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED event while the state machine is in RUNNING state. Can you please elaborate a little more on that?\r\n\r\n3) Some minor comments: there is an unused variable you added in AMLaunchedTransition; the log in AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition  is too generic. Can we add application id, attempt id and the timestamp?;\r\n\r\nThe change in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/proto/server/application_history_server.proto is unnecessary as you have decided not to change for ATS (all versions). \r\n\r\nThe schedulingWaitTime in AppInfo is misleading if one application has multiple attempts. Because the launch time is updated everytime a new attempt is launched, we can rename it to the launch time of the latest attempt. If there are mutiple attempts, the running time of previous attempts would be counted as schedulingwait time, which is not correct.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=haibochen","name":"haibochen","key":"haibochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haibo

Here are my responses\r\n{quote}We are generating the timestamp when RMAppImpl is notified of the launch. But the correct timestamp should come from RMAppAttemptEventType.LAUNCHED that is generated by AMLauncher. If the event dispatch thread is falling back, there could be a large gap between when RMAppImpl is notified and when the attempt is actually launched.\r\n{quote}\r\nI have addressed the above by adding a new constructor to update the timeStamp in the data members of _RMAppEvent and RMAppAttemptEvent_ classes.\r\n\r\n \r\n{quote}I see two transitions are added to RMAPPImpl state machine, namely ACCEPTED --> ACCEPTED and RUNNING --> RUNNING upon the new RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_LAUNCHED....\r\n{quote}\r\nI have addressed this by removing the unwanted transition handling state change of RUNING --> RUNNING\r\n\r\n \r\n{quote}Some minor comments: there is an unused variable you added in AMLaunchedTransition; the log in AppRunningOnAppAttemptLaunchTransition  is too generic. Can we add application id, attempt id and the timestamp?\r\n\r\nThe change in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-api/src/main/proto/server/application_history_server.proto is unnecessary as you have decided not to change for ATS (all versions). \r\n{quote}\r\nDone as suggested\r\n\r\n \r\n{quote}The schedulingWaitTime in AppInfo is misleading if one application has multiple attempts. Because the launch time is updated everytime a new attempt is launched, we can rename it to the launch time of the latest attempt. If there are mutiple attempts, the running time of previous attempts would be counted as schedulingwait time, which is not correct.\r\n{quote}\r\nI update the launchTime only if it is non zero so I guess we are fine here?\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nFour tests failed in the last run. Three are from *TestMRTimelineEventHandling*.

But I am still not sure if we should add schedulingwait time and total run time. If an application have more than one attempts, and the following attempt(s) spend some time waiting to be scheduled, then the two metrics are not accurate. Thus, I'm inclined to not add them.\r\n\r\nBesides, I have a few more minor comments.\r\n\r\n1) The change to remove the period in ApplicationReport.getName() javadoc is unnecessary.

Thanks for pointing this.\r\n\r\nI am still bit confused though. It may be because of the variable name called launchTime. An app is started when we create RMApp. But per scheduler, an app is started when an attempt is launched (post scheduling). Now I can see that the launchTime what we discuss here is the same. Now multiple attempts could happen, and one may succeed. Still launchTime will be first attempt's launchTime. Are we looking for this time itself ? because for attempt, i can understand what is attempt launch. Now for an app, what is the difference b/w app start vs app launch. if we clearly looking for this, then its fine. ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2018-04-17T15:17:56.559+0000","updated":"2018-04-17T15:17:56.559+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097137/comment/16441041","id":"16441041","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kanwaljeets","name":"kanwaljeets","key":"kanwaljeets","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kanwaljeet Sachdev","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~sunilg], we are looking explicitly at first launchTime and do not want to care about subsequent attempt launches if app restarts.
