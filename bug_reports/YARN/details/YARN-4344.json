Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks for the patch, Varun!  I think the change will fix the reported issue, but I'm a bit skeptical of the vastly different handling of the event based on whether apps are running or not.  For example, if the http port is changing when the node re-registers, why are we treating it as a node removal then addition if there aren't any apps running but not if there are apps running?  Seems like that should be consistent.\n\nComments on the patch itself:\n\nThe comment about sending the node removal event at the start of the main block in the transition is no longer very accurate.\n \nPlease don't put large sleeps (on the order of seconds) in tests.  These extra sleep seconds quickly add up to a significant amount of time over many tests.  If we need to sleep for polling reasons the sleep should be much shorter, like on the order of 10ms.  Better than sleep-polling is flushing the event dispatcher and then checking since we can avoid polling entirely.\n\nNit: isCapabilityChanged init can be simplified to the following, similar to the noRunningApps boolean init above it:\n{code}\n      boolean isCapabilityChanged =\n          !rmNode.getTotalCapability().equals(newNode.getTotalCapability());\n {code}\n\nNit: is this conditional check even necessary?  We can just update the total capability with no semantic effect if it hasn't changed.  Since this is just updating a reference with another precomputed one, it's not like we're avoiding some expensive code. ;-)\n{code}\n        if (isCapabilityChanged) {\n          rmNode.totalCapability = newNode.getTotalCapability();\n        }\n{code}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-11T15:30:55.176+0000","updated":"2015-11-11T15:30:55.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12912126/comment/15001800","id":"15001800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for reporting this issue [~vvasudev]!

The code is assuming that an NM registering without any active apps might be a non-work-preserving NM reconnecting, so we need to explicitly remove the node and add it back in so the scheduler will release any containers that were being tracked on that node.\n\nAt first I thought YARN-3802 had an inherent race in it where it assumes that the node event will be processed before the capability is updated.  That turns out to be true for the CapacityScheduler, but I think that's a bug in the CapacityScheduler.  Note that node update path appears to have the same issue -- RMNodeImpl updates the node's capability _before_ sending the scheduler node updated event.  So how can it work in that case?  It works because the CapacityScheduler for node update isn't looking at what the resource was in the RMNode passed in the event.  Instead it's looking up the scheduler node based on the RMNodeId and then referencing the total capability tracked there.  Seems to me the bug here is that the scheduler is relying on the RMNode in the event directly rather than the SchedulerNode to handle the capability calculation.  We probably should have limited a lot of these scheduler events to just having RMNodeId rather than the full RMNode to avoid the temptation to directly examine the RMNode when handling the event.  As seen here, the RMNode can be \"moving\" while the scheduler is trying to examine it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-11-12T18:28:01.058+0000","updated":"2015-11-12T18:28:01.058+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12912126/comment/15003181","id":"15003181","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 for Jason Lowe's suggestion to fix the issue at scheduler side. Using {{SchedulerNode.getTotalResource()}} instead of {{RMNode.getTotalCapability()}} inside Scheduler can better decouple Scheduler from RMNodeImpl state machine. It may also fix some other potential issues. For example, {{CapacityScheduler#addNode}} uses {{nodeManager.getTotalCapability()}} after creating {{FiCaSchedulerNode}}, if {{nodeManager.totalCapability}} is changed by RMNodeImpl state machine right after {{FiCaSchedulerNode}} was created, similar issue may happen.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-12T23:21:16.771+0000","updated":"2015-11-12T23:21:16.771+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12912126/comment/15003851","id":"15003851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for the feedback everyone.
