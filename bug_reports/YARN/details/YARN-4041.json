Also I'm not thrilled with the idea of sleeping for 1 second per application and hoping it's enough time.  And we're getting out early when there is at least one token in the token set, but there's a race where we may have taken a snapshot before all the tokens are there.  Can't we key off the app start events coming out of the token renewal process to know when we're done?

I think its better we place that logic inside waitForTokensToBeRenewed itself as suggested. I also was not much liking the solution of sleep, however a better checkpoint was not raised explicitly from DelegationTokenRenewer. I also thought of checking the event queue size there. Now I feel we can verify that whether any Token renewal event is raised or not. It can be a good checkpoint.

Threads can still be executing the last events, having just pulled them from the queue to leave it empty.  Therefore the test is still racy.  A simpler approach would be to just keep checking if the tokens are equal.  If they aren't then sleep for a bit then try again, up to some limit of time to keep checking.\n\nBy the way, we should not sleep an entire second between checks.  All those seconds of waiting add up across all of our tests doing it, making it take significantly longer to run them overall.  We should be sleeping for only 10ms or so.  That's still a large amount of time for modern processors to get work done while we're waiting, and we still won't be spinning non-stop on the CPU.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-10-22T20:18:56.009+0000","updated":"2015-10-22T20:18:56.009+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12853917/comment/14970465","id":"14970465","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Yes [~jlowe], we can compare with token itself and do wait in smaller units.
