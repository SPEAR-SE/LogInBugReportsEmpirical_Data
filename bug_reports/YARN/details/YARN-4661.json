In the context of YARN-4752, I am attempting comprehensive changes to preemption. As discussed in YARN-2154, we think it might best to just preempt any container if the corresponding application is over its fairshare. The primary goal here is to ensure the preempted container(s) are all on one node and the resultant resources are actually enough to allocate the container we are preempting these for. \n\nIn that context, I believe it would quite expensive to also consider a preemption policy. \n\nDo you agree? If yes, may be, we should close this as \"Won't fix\"?
