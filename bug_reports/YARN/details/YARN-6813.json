The heartbeat interval was kept intentionally low as the purpose of the test was to trigger token renewals.

If the whole point of all this waiting is to get a token renewed, I'd rather do one or more of the following:\n# Add a way for tests to force a token renewal rather than needing to wait some specific amount of wall clock time\n# Programmatically invoke/control the heartbeating for both the NM and the AM in the test so we aren't needlessly waiting in the test for a heartbeat timer to expire\n# Move the relevant pieces over to a controlled clock where we can programmatically speed up time if necessary to trigger certain time-based events\n\nA typical tell-tale sign for a unit test with race conditions is when it calls Thread.sleep.  The test is going to sometimes fail because something didn't run fast enough relative to the sleep or the test runs needlessly longer than it should.
