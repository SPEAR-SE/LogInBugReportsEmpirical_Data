It is the sum of all the resources of containers from applications that run in a queue. A node heartbeat with a changed usage does not mean that the usage changed because an application in the queue has changed it. It could have changed due to a different queue/application adding a container.\r\n\r\nWe're also not allocating anything just yet and have thus not gone over. When the application is updated, at a later point in time, that is when we do that check. We just have a preliminary check here to see if we can offer this node to the queue. Another point to take into account: we are not checking what the application asked for here. That is the next step that follows just below when we run over all the applications that have a demand:\r\n\r\n{code}\r\n    for (FSAppAttempt sched : fetchAppsWithDemand(true)) {\r\n      if (SchedulerAppUtils.isPlaceBlacklisted(sched, node, LOG)) {\r\n        continue;\r\n      }\r\n      assigned = sched.assignContainer(node);\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest we can find what the ask is. If there are more applications with a demand for the queue we walk over the list. We call [assignContainer |https://github.com/apache/hadoop/blob/trunk/hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/scheduler/fair/FSAppAttempt.java#L830]\r\nand that is where the checks happen.\r\nOne of the checks we perform is in hasContainerForNode for the FSAppAttempt:\r\n{code}\r\n    } else if (!getQueue().fitsInMaxShare(resource)) {\r\n      // The requested container must fit in queue maximum share\r\n      updateAMDiagnosticMsg(resource,\r\n          \" exceeds current queue or its parents maximum resource allowed).\");\r\n\r\n      ret = false;\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nWhich makes the allocation fail and thus we drop out and check the next request for the application and if that all fails we check the next application in the list from apps with demand.\r\n\r\nDo you have any logs that show that this is not working as it should?\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wilfreds","name":"wilfreds","key":"wilfreds","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wilfred Spiegelenburg","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2017-11-20T09:12:42.181+0000","updated":"2017-11-20T09:12:42.181+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13119552/comment/16259011","id":"16259011","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daemon","name":"daemon","key":"daemon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"YunFan Zhou","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~wilfreds] You can take it for free!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daemon","name":"daemon","key":"daemon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"YunFan Zhou","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-11-20T09:33:39.146+0000","updated":"2017-11-20T09:33:39.146+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13119552/comment/16259530","id":"16259530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yufeigu","name":"yufeigu","key":"yufeigu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240"},"displayName":"Yufei Gu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~wilfreds] for pointing out. {{FSQueue#fitsInMaxShare}} does check the max resource by recursively bottom-up traversing schedulable tree.
