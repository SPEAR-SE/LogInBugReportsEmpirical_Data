My thoughts behind going ahead with this issue is, if the script has syntax error then there is possibility that the script might not execute properly and detect any issues with the node's health (if any). So i felt warning to the user that the script has error(or returning a error code) is better than just passing the evaluation as successful. \nbq. If we are going to change the behaviour that is documented we should not do it in release 2.8.1 and also update all related documentation.\nAgree that required documentation and comments needs to be modified/upgrade (which we missed in the patch). But not to do in 2.8.1 release is a debatable topic which can be further discussed upon. Few points in favor of doing it is, \n# we are doing the change in minor version than the major version. (2.8.0 is not yet released and if possible we can incorporate in it too)\n# As mentioned above if there is issue in the script better to flag it as an error rather than silently passing it as success, so better to flag an error if any script issues even for existing cluster too.\n\nThoughts ? would also like to see others input too\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-08-30T04:34:06.931+0000","updated":"2016-08-30T04:34:06.931+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13000530/comment/15449561","id":"15449561","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rchiang","name":"rchiang","key":"rchiang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ray Chiang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~wilfreds] for that.

But not trusting the exit code was one of the key learnings by the ops team from the HOD experience. It fails a lot more often than people realize, mainly due to users doing crazy things, especially on insecure systems.\n\nThis is one of those times where it's going to be extremely difficult to convince me otherwise.  I can't think of a reason to ever trust the exit code enough to bring down the NodeManager.   In this particular environment, the number of conditions that the script can fail for reasons which may be temporary/pointless are many.  \n\nNow it could be argued that those temporary failures should cause the NM to come down, but then you get into a race condition between heartbeats and actual issues.  HDFS worked around it by basically saying \"it has to fail for X long\". Ignoring the exit code avoids that problem because one can be sure that \"ERROR -\" really did come from the script.\n\nbq. Alternatively, would you be okay with standardizing on a specific error code for \"detected bad Node\" vs \"bad script\"?\n\nIf by error code you specifically mean the value the NM reports back to the RM, yes that makes sense.
