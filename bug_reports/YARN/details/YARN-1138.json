The patch looks good.  It's a similar approach to MAPREDUCE-5442.  Two minor things:\n# There is some indentation by 3 spaces instead of 2 around the property in yarn-default.xml.  The indentation was already off in the current code, but would you mind fixing it as part of this patch?\n# It's no longer possible for someone to look at yarn-default.xml and see the default classpath.  In MAPREDUCE-5442, we worked around this by adding extra documentation in the description field.  Would you mind doing the same here?  Here is what we ended up with for {{mapreduce.application.classpath}} in mapred-default.xml:\n\n{code}\n<property>\n  <description>CLASSPATH for MR applications. A comma-separated list\n  of CLASSPATH entries. If mapreduce.application.framework is set then this\n  must specify the appropriate classpath for that archive, and the name of\n  the archive must be present in the classpath. \n  When this value is empty, the following default CLASSPATH for MR \n  applications would be used. \n  For Linux:\n  $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*,\n  $HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*.\n  For Windows:\n  %HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME%/share/hadoop/mapreduce/*,\n  %HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME%/share/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/*.\n  </description>\n  <name>mapreduce.application.classpath</name>\n  <value></value>\n</property>\n{code}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-09T17:52:25.617+0000","updated":"2014-01-09T17:52:25.617+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12666761/comment/13866977","id":"13866977","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sound good!
