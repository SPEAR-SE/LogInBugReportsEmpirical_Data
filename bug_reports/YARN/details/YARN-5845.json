Makes sense in not publishing an app ACLs' updated event on each RM restart even for apps being recovered (especially finished apps). As you said, the timestamp is different which would mean multiple entries in the store.\nWe republish the app created event on recovery too, to handle the case where app was created and stored but the event was not sent to timeline server.\nBasically, it seems as of now we send the App ACLs' updated event even before we send an app created event which is a little weird.\n\nI was thinking why not send app created event with ACLs' in application submission context.

We can simply fill the info in entity info instead of having a separate event and an event info. This will aid in easy filtering using info filters.  \n\ncc [~rohithsharma], as you were doing ATSv2 integration with Tez, can you confirm if last point would be fine for Tez.
