That is one of the motivations (agree it is an IntelliJ issue, on the other hand the change does not affect the project built at all and allows IntelliJ users to build/debug from the IDE out of the box without doing funny voodoo).\n\nThe other motivation, and IMO is more important, is to clean up the dependencies modules like yarn-api and yarn-client have. Restricting them to what is used on the client side. Using the dependency:tree and dependency:analyze plugins I’ve reduced the 3rd party JARs required by the clients significantly. As [~stevel@apache.org] pointed out there is much more work we should do in this direction, this is a first non-intrusive baby step in that direction.\n\nTo give you and idea, before the this patch *hadoop-yarn-api* reports as required dependencies by itself:\n\n{code}\n +- org.slf4j:slf4j-api:jar:1.7.5:compile\n +- org.slf4j:slf4j-log4j12:jar:1.7.5:compile\n |  \\- log4j:log4j:jar:1.2.17:compile\n +- org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-annotations:jar:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT:compile\n |  +- tomcat:jasper-compiler:jar:5.5.23:test\n +- com.google.inject.extensions:guice-servlet:jar:3.0:compile\n +- io.netty:netty:jar:3.6.2.Final:compile\n +- com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:jar:2.5.0:compile\n +- commons-io:commons-io:jar:2.4:compile\n +- com.google.inject:guice:jar:3.0:compile\n |  +- javax.inject:javax.inject:jar:1:compile\n |  \\- aopalliance:aopalliance:jar:1.0:compile\n +- com.sun.jersey:jersey-server:jar:1.9:compile\n |  +- asm:asm:jar:3.2:compile\n |  \\- com.sun.jersey:jersey-core:jar:1.9:compile\n +- com.sun.jersey:jersey-json:jar:1.9:compile\n |  +- org.codehaus.jettison:jettison:jar:1.1:compile\n |  |  \\- stax:stax-api:jar:1.0.1:compile\n |  +- com.sun.xml.bind:jaxb-impl:jar:2.2.3-1:compile\n |  |  \\- javax.xml.bind:jaxb-api:jar:2.2.2:compile\n |  |     \\- javax.activation:activation:jar:1.1:compile\n |  +- org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-core-asl:jar:1.8.8:compile\n |  +- org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-mapper-asl:jar:1.8.8:compile\n |  +- org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-jaxrs:jar:1.8.8:compile (version managed from 1.8.3)\n |  \\- org.codehaus.jackson:jackson-xc:jar:1.8.8:compile (version managed from 1.8.3)\n \\- com.sun.jersey.contribs:jersey-guice:jar:1.9:compile\n{code}\n\nWith the patch, the required dependencies by itself are down to:\n\n{code}\n +- commons-lang:commons-lang:jar:2.6:compile\n +- com.google.guava:guava:jar:11.0.2:compile\n |  \\- com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305:jar:1.3.9:compile\n +- commons-logging:commons-logging:jar:1.1.3:compile\n +- org.apache.hadoop:hadoop-annotations:jar:3.0.0-SNAPSHOT:compile\n \\- com.google.protobuf:protobuf-java:jar:2.5.0:compile\n{code}\n\nDoes this address your concerns?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2014-01-09T17:50:00.930+0000","updated":"2014-01-09T17:50:13.214+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12655392/comment/13866923","id":"13866923","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Makes sense now.
