I've found that sendSignal works well with traditional procp (http://procps.sourceforge.net/), whereas it causes such a error with procps-ng (https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Features/procps-ng) used in MintOS 14. As you know, 'kill' command is included in procp package in general linux distributions. When I only change the 'kill' binary into traditional one, stopContainer works well.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"249831","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"sendSignal in DefaultContainerExecutor causes \"invalid options\" error","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hyunsik.choi","name":"hyunsik.choi","key":"hyunsik.choi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hyunsik Choi","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hyunsik.choi","name":"hyunsik.choi","key":"hyunsik.choi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hyunsik Choi","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Seoul"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"* OS: MintOS 14\n** MintOS 14 is based on ubuntu 12.10.
