This, in turn, is triggering alerts in Ambari.\n\nA network dump of the ambari poll against the secondary RM looks like:\n\nRequest:\n\"\"\"\nGET /jmx?qry=Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=RMNMInfo HTTP/1.1\n...\n\"\"\"\n\nResponse:\n\"\"\"\nHTTP/1.1 200 OK\n...\nRefresh: 3; url=http://{my-primary-rm}:8088/jmx\nContent-Length: 106\nServer: Jetty(6.1.26.hwx)\n\nThis is standby RM. Redirecting to the current active RM:\nhttp://{my-primary-rm}:8088/jmx\n\"\"\"\n\nComment from Jonathan Hurley jhurley@hortonworks.com -\n---\nThis is caused by how YARN does HA mode. With two YARN RMs, the standby RM returns a 200 response with a JavaScript redirect instead of an 3xx redirection. When not using Kerberos, Ambari should be able to parse the headers and follow the JS-based redirect. However, on a Kerberized cluster, we use curl which cannot do this. Therefore, requests against the secondary RM will return an UNKNOWN response since it did get a 200. I think a few things can be improved here:\n\n1) There should be a ticket filed for YARN to have their HA mode use a proper redirect\n2) Ambari might not want to produce an UNKNOWN response here since it gives a false feeling that something went wrong.\n---\n\nI've also filed AMBARI-12995 with the ambari team.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"YARN HA secondary-RM/NM redirect not parseable by Ambari/curl in a Kerberoized deployment","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arobertson","name":"arobertson","key":"arobertson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Robertson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arobertson","name":"arobertson","key":"arobertson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew Robertson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12861577/comment/14729404","id":"14729404","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~arobertson]\nLooks like duplicate with https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-2605.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-03T17:10:01.039+0000","updated":"2015-09-03T17:10:01.039+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-4112/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2jqxr:"}}
