Hard enforcement can be done via a cgroup cpu controller. Using an absolute minimum of a few CPU shares (ie 10) in the LinuxContainerExecutor we ensure there is enough CPU cycles to run the sleep process. This absolute minimum would only kick-in if zero is allowed, otherwise will never kick in as the shares for 1 CPU are 1024.\n\n* For Memory. Hard enforcement is currently done by the ProcfsBasedProcessTree.java, using a minimum absolute of 1 or 2 MBs would take care of zero memory resources. And again, this absolute minimum would only kick-in if zero is allowed, otherwise will never kick in as the increment memory is in several MBs if not 1GB.\n\nThere would be no default for this hard minimum, if not set no correction will be done.

Minimum will come into play when 0 resources are allowed but not when 0 resources are not allowed. How do understand this as a user? I am not suggesting that this hasnt been thought through or there is no use for this etc. There are 2 paths 1) being really flexible and allowing all possible definitions and combinations 2) restricting the parameters and allowing most of the users to get stuff done easily.

The use case for this as been articulated in YARN-789.\n\nCurrently, this works fine except when you configure your cluster enforce memory and/or CPU utilization. In this case zero is not possible because regardless how minimal the process running in the container is, it will use some memory and CPU.\n\nTo enable memory and/or CPU utilization enforcement when having one or more AM asking for zero capabilities in one dimension of their resource request, we need to have a 'correction' in the actual enforcement.\n\nThe proposed solution adds knobs to do enable that correction, but it does not change the behavior at all if your don't set those knobs.\n\nBottom line, we are enabling a different set of use-cases without harming/changing at all the current behavior.\n\nThis is not new, it was mentioned and clearly explained in YARN-789.
