Localize the same resource with different timestamp (if it is unexpected) is a very tricky issue and is hard to debug for now as you cannot differentiate this case from the other case that the source file is actually changed during localization process. \nIf the fix is to detect and fail fast for duplicated resources case, then it shouldn't be hard as we can just add a map from resource path to timestamp which can complain earlier that if another resource with the same path but different timestamp. My only concern here is if we should support the case that resource override - assume we have common used bundle of jars (in format of tar ball, etc.) in distributed cache and we want to replace one of them in one job run. However, this sounds like not work today as the complain on timestamp will happen during localization but I would like to hear ideas or real use cases here.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2016-07-05T16:11:55.770+0000","updated":"2016-07-05T16:11:55.770+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-5306/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i30g0f:"}}
