But I do no think it is the proper solution.\nThe ticket YARN-1303 is used to solve the issue that we can not allow multiple commands separating with \";\" in distributed-shell. The reason why we can not do that, you might need to check the comments at YARN-1303.\nSo, if we launch the AM with --shell_command, we will meet the same issue as before (can not allow multiple commands separating with \";\"  or \"|\"). Right ?\n\nSo, we may need to stick to the same solution as YARN-1303, create a file to save the shell_command, and let AM find out whether this file exists or not.\n\nWe can either try to parse the cmd from --cmd option, to figure out which part is --shell_command, and pull all the commands into a file. But this solution may not be stable, since we need to get all the characters between --shell_command and the next \"--\". And it can be easily break.\n\nThe simplest but a little bit tedious solution could be that we just add all the options that AM can support including --shell_command, --shell_args, --shell_scripts and --log4j_properties , excluding --cmd option into UnmanagedAMLaucher, and handle them as we did in org.apache.hadoop.yarn.applications.distributedshell.Client.\n\nthoughts ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-27T23:26:35.349+0000","updated":"2013-11-27T23:26:35.349+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681204/comment/13834382","id":"13834382","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"bq.

You can try running a MR app under unmanaged-AM and see for yourselves - it will fail mainly because Unmanaged AM doesn't seem to have a concept of the client code. Which is the main reason for this test failing. We can either\n - Disable this test\n - Change this test to not use distributed-shell\n - Or fix unmanaged-AM to start supporting client-code too. Ideally this can be done by making UnManaged-AM implement ApplicationClientProtocol and let any application take advantage of an unmanaged AM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-12-02T21:32:55.778+0000","updated":"2013-12-02T21:32:55.778+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681204/comment/13837400","id":"13837400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi Vinod, \nThanks for the explanation, I think I am confused about the propose of UnmanagedAM, the document of UnmanagedAM says:\nbq. The UnmanagedLauncher is a simple client that launches and unmanaged AM. An unmanagedAM is an AM that is not launched and managed by the RM.\nI thought it is used as a tool, new apps can use this to launch AM locally without create/start YarnClient. If old apps have a workable standalone AM, it can be launched by this tool too. I did not consider it as a tool to launch old client based apps, of course it will fail if it is used to launch arbitrarily old apps.  Which leads to the question:\n1. What is the usage of UnmanagedAM? Support new special apps which need a local AM or support all apps? If the later it is far from complete, so either disable this test or write&use a simple AM in test.\n2. Is distributedshell.ApplicationMaster not supposed to be launched standalone and must only be called by distributedshell.Client?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2013-12-03T06:44:10.194+0000","updated":"2013-12-03T06:44:10.194+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681204/comment/13839044","id":"13839044","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Attach new patch, changes:\nWrite a standalone simple AM to be used in test.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=decster","name":"decster","key":"decster","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Binglin Chang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2013-12-04T16:23:58.945+0000","updated":"2013-12-04T16:23:58.945+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681204/comment/13839061","id":"13839061","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
