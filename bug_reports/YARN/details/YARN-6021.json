In this case, it appears cluster capacity is 10 vcores (fairshare of root). When the admin sets the minshare of 'a' to 6, the message to the scheduler is to give queue 'a' 6 vcores if they are available. So, if the minshares of 'a' and 'b' are 6 and 5 respectively, all the resources should go to those two queues. Queue 'c' should not be given any resources unless 'a' and 'b' do not end up using all the resources. That is exactly what a zero fairshare means. Note that a queue with zero fairshare might still be allocated resources if other queues don't use theirs. \n\nTo me, the behavior is expected and makes sense. If anything, if sum of all minshares exceeds cluster capacity, we should likely warn the user; on a dynamic cluster, it is possible for the cluster to loose a few nodes temporarily and the cluster capacity go below sum of all minshares.

This was necessary because fairshare preemption was very rigid. Since then, we have augmented fairshare preemption with a threshold and timeout giving more control to the admins. I would encourage trying these new controls out instead of using minshare preemption. \n# When preemption is not enabled, setting minshare for a queue forcibly sets the fairshare of the queue to at least that value. Using minshare makes sense only when used for special cases. In a cluster where most queues have a minshare set, there is no more *fairness*. \n\nAlso, minshare is an absolute value and needs to be updated as the cluster grows/shrinks. For these reasons, I would discourage the use of minshare. At Cloudera, we discourage our customers too. There are exceptions: a high-priority, latency-sensitive workload that needs at least {{x}} resources to start. \n\nIn your example, I think either minshares are being abused or the cluster is too small. If all the queues require at least those many resources to be functional, clearly the cluster cannot accommodate all of them coming together. \n\nPS: If backward compatibility were not important, I would have advocated for removing minshare altogether.
