Currently it only works within a MR app (AM and tasks). However, one could argue that the functionality it provides is a generic one in that it creates a somewhat isolated class space. Perhaps we could rename the job classloader to something like an app classloader, and make it available for any place wherever user code needs to run in isolation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-23T15:55:42.378+0000","updated":"2014-05-23T15:55:42.378+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715862/comment/14007284","id":"14007284","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"... user code or any code that needs to run in isolation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-23T16:00:52.072+0000","updated":"2014-05-23T16:00:52.072+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715862/comment/14007291","id":"14007291","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Isolating apps is just one aspect.

And we couldn't upload a newer version of Jackson, because again, what's on the CP is what you get. \n# If, client-side you abandon that CP and use/redist your entire hadoop binary set then you can reduce the risk here, at the expense of taking away from ops any control of the versions of things you run on the cluster, but then you now have to deal with older files in the cluster.\n# or you ignore yarn.lib.classpath entirely, *somehow* work out the values of yarn-site.xml &c, and re-upload every single hadoop-*.jar and its chosen binaries into every single container. having a YARN artifact repo will reduce the cost of that, but add a new one: bug fixes in hadoop will only propagate when the apps are rebuilt.\n# ..if you look at the HADOOP-9991 issue you can see links to some places where the outdated JARs in Hadoop cause problems for other ASF projects.\n# Tez appears to have broken because it was explicity putting the 1.8.x JARs on its list of binaries to upload. It only worked because it was using exactly the same version. \n# if you adopt a policy of change no dependencies that break apps that upload duplicate JARs to the CP -then this goes beyond Jackson, it says \"hadoop cannot update any of its dependencies\". That would go for 2.x and no doubt even if we did update things for 3.x, then we'll still get \"you broke my code that uploaded jackson \n1.8\" issues.\n# ...and we haven't gone near Guava yet, which is frozen because it really is so brittle, but that means we can't pick up the guava 16.x-only fixes needed to work with the latest JVMs. \n\nIf you do want to revoke jackson, I'm not going to veto it -but it goes beyond YARN, and we may as well revert every single HADOOP-9991-related upgrade.
