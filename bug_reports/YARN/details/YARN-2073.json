(In this case, we'd probably want to make sure preemption only happens on the nodes being waited for; otherwise we'd kill containers needlessly).\n\nIf the goal is to make sure that we aren't preempting on behalf of an application that's actually receiving resources, it might also be worth considering time-based approaches.

Also, we can make it a per-queue config or a single factor for the cluster.\n\nEventually, we need a better story for preemption.
