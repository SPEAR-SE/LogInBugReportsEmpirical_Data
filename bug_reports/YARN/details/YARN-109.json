Even though it is not modifying call method logically but still I see changes there.\n\nCan we simply keep a flag to track all the places in unpack method where renameTo was called (To indicate not to delete file as it is already deleted). and towards the end before returning we can delete file based on flag value. For file deletion we can even use File.delete(). I guess this will make it cleaner and will keep the tmp file handling logic intact as we need to log an error message in case we are unable to delete the .tmp file.\n\nThe code is still not handling situation where resource.getType() == ARCHIVE and it is .jar or if it is PATTERN and .zip file.\n\nAlso I see that entire test code is only testing if the file is a tar file and ARCHIVE type but not for other extensions / TYPE. I think we need to test all the combinations ( .zip , .tar, .jar ) and it is specified as FILE, PATTERN or ARCHIVE.\n\nAlso for the test I think you will have to add a timeout parameter. @Test(timeout=<value>) to avoid -1.\n\nPlease let me know your thoughts on this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ojoshi","name":"ojoshi","key":"ojoshi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634"},"displayName":"Omkar Vinit Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-21T00:06:08.538+0000","updated":"2013-03-21T00:06:08.538+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607966/comment/13608705","id":"13608705","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mayank_bansal","name":"mayank_bansal","key":"mayank_bansal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mayank Bansal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~ojoshi]\nThere are no changes in call its just I formatted that with hadoop formatter.\n\nI modified the unpack for all the cases.\n\nI added couple of more test methods to test some more cases , Looks to me enough for this change.

It should not be a problem so either use the return value to log a warning when it fails or update the findbugs filter to filter out the error.\n\nThe -1 for the test timeouts is caused by a bug in the script used to detect these, so you can either ignore it, or add a timeout to any @Test that appears in the patch file, including the ones you didn't add :(.\n\nIn the test, please uncomment the lines to cleanup after the test.  Are they causing a problem for the test to pass? or was it just for debugging?\n\nAlso I personally would prefer to have a few small jar/tar/zip files checked into the repository instead of generating them on they fly for the test.  It will speed up the test and have less dependencies on the system being set up with the exact commands, i.e. bash for windows support.  Although if you don't feel like changing it I am fine with that too, most of those commands are used by FSDownload already so it is not that critical.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-21T13:29:56.688+0000","updated":"2013-03-21T13:29:56.688+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607966/comment/13609233","id":"13609233","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ojoshi","name":"ojoshi","key":"ojoshi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634"},"displayName":"Omkar Vinit Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~mayank_bansal] Thanks for updating it. :) Now it looks good.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ojoshi","name":"ojoshi","key":"ojoshi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634"},"displayName":"Omkar Vinit Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-21T18:07:59.231+0000","updated":"2013-03-21T18:07:59.231+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12607966/comment/13609495","id":"13609495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mayank_bansal","name":"mayank_bansal","key":"mayank_bansal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mayank Bansal","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~revans2]\n\nThanks for the comments and review.
