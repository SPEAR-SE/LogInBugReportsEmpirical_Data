The comparator needs to call getResourceUsage(), which is calculated as sum_of_live_containers. However, for preemption, the resourceUsage should be (sum_of_live_containers - sum_of_toBePreempted_containers). Instead of defining a new comparator, I snapshot the resourceusage to a TempScheduler structure, which overrides the getResourceUsage() function.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ywskycn","name":"ywskycn","key":"ywskycn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wei Yan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-27T15:35:18.650+0000","updated":"2014-03-27T15:35:18.650+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643787/comment/13949522","id":"13949522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
