One attack vector is to process small files that contain sensitive data to use this mechanism to access contents of small files. \nThis requests aims to counter that by providing for configuration at service level that lets yarn encrypt all the data that gets to cache on each node. Yarn components should encrypt while copying the data on to disk and decrypt during the processing. Lets start by leveraging the symmetric key mechanism used by HDFS transparent mechanism similar to DEK (Data Encryption key) that could be generated as part of the process.\nNext step could be to setup Encryption zone key similar to transperent encryption mechanism.\nPlease suggest if there is a better way.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Add Configration to support encryption of Distributed Cache Data","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=SINGHVJD","name":"SINGHVJD","key":"singhvjd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Singh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=SINGHVJD","name":"SINGHVJD","key":"singhvjd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Singh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12860556/comment/14942365","id":"14942365","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=SINGHVJD","name":"SINGHVJD","key":"singhvjd","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vijay Singh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I have few approaches that I have coded.
