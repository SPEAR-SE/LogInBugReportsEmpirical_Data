This container process need handle some shutdown events or some logic, but hardly can get CPU, we suppose to see a {{SIGKILL}} as there is {{DelayedProcessKiller}} ,but the parent process which persisted as container pid no longer exist, so the kill command can not reach the container process. This is how orphan container process come.\nThe orphan process do exit after some time, but the period can be very long, and will make the OS status worse.
