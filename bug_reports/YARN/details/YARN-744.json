It's broken the way it is rightnow though.\nApplicationMasterService seems to be written to handle one bad request (caused by network issues etc). allocate() does more than a scheduler.allocate - node state changes, newly allocated containers etc. All of that needs to be part of a single response. Without the lock - that may not happen. Locking on the AppAttemptId or the AppId itself is probably a better option, and also needs to cover the retrieval of the last response.\nAlso, we shouldn't be logging in the allocate call (not at INFO level anyway).
