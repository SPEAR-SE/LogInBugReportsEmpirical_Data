We download statics (such as images, js files, icons) from the server which is hosting (Currently both RM has this). Once we have statics, page will be rendered and then server invocation will done to fetch data (This will be done only from ACTIVE RM). Hence after switching, basic static may b served from standby RM, however data is fetched only from Active RM. In contrast to old UI where it is a server side impl, new UI is end to end client side. So it helps to overcome this redirects etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2018-01-08T08:24:27.885+0000","updated":"2018-01-08T08:24:27.885+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-7711/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3omin:"}}
