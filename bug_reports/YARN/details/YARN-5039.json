Apps can be pending despite cluster resource availability depending upon how the queues and user limits are configured.  Given there's only one app running and one app pending, it's acting like the queue is only allowing one active app at a time.  If you go to the RM scheduler page and expand the details for the queue (click the triangle to the left of the queue bar) then it will show pertinent details like Max Application Master Resources, Used Application Master Resources, Max Application Master Resources Per User, Num Schedulable Applications, Num Non-Schedulable Applications, etc.  If it shows a non-zero number of non-schedulable applications then that's likely because adding the app would exceed the maximum application master resource limit for the user or queue.  The RM log would contain lines like \"not starting application as amIfStarted exceeds amLimit\" when that occurs.\n\nEither way if the spread of containers across those nodes is not expected it would be good to get some debug logs for the LeafQueue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-05-04T21:39:27.910+0000","updated":"2016-05-04T21:39:27.910+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12965090/comment/15271486","id":"15271486","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=milesc","name":"milesc","key":"milesc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Miles Crawford","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching a screenshot of the scheduler screen - I do not believe there is any policy preventing this app from starting.\n\nIn addition, oftentimes we do have two or three or more applications running and starting without delay.
