For a brief period of time, node manager will report back that container is in RUNNING state, then fail the container later.  One possible solution is to change container-executor for non-entry-point mode to become more similar to entry_point mode to run docker run in the foreground, and parent process have a set of retries for docker inspect to obtain PID.  This removes the possible false positive reporting of RUNNING state.  The synthetic timeout approach may kill container prematurely (or wait longer than necessary for failing container), if container takes more than 30 seconds (or configured values) to start the first process in the container.  Do we want to make non-entry-point to work like entry-point to prevent the false positive or we are ok with current state?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-07-26T18:26:54.379+0000","updated":"2018-07-26T18:30:00.985+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13174945/comment/16558907","id":"16558907","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"There is backward incompatibility concern with distributed shell, where we allow user to specify multiple unix command and output redirection of log file.
