I think NM will call {{getNMContainerStatuses()}} instead of {{getContainerStatuses()}} upon receiving RESYNC from restarted RM. {{getNMContainerStatuses()}} remains unchanged and still reports all the completed containers for non-completed apps. The uploaded patch will let the normal heartbeat (not after receiving RESYNC) send only useful container status information to RM. So I guess the work-preserving RM restart is not affected.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chengbing.liu","name":"chengbing.liu","key":"chengbing.liu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chengbing Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2014-12-31T02:02:36.558+0000","updated":"2014-12-31T02:02:36.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12764140/comment/14261797","id":"14261797","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
