In some cases, YARN provide flexible resource model to allow resource to do over commit. Just like OS can claim/allocate more memory resource than physical one - backed by virtual memory mechanism, YARN's resource model is also flexible here - backed by mechanisms like: resource/container preemption, dynamic resource configuration (YARN-291), etc. We never have assumption that available resource couldn't be negative value, and this negative value can notify YARN to balance resource consumption again in some way. \nThus, I propose to resolve this JIRA as Not A problem or Invalid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-08-28T14:38:50.022+0000","updated":"2015-08-28T14:38:50.022+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12857649/comment/14719968","id":"14719968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lichangleo","name":"lichangleo","key":"lichangleo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Chang Li","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"thanks [~djp] for explain.

Even if we overcommit resources, it needs to transparent to users. This is actually one of the goals of YARN-1011. \n\nWith regards to YARN-291, I was under the impression the primary motive of that work was to allow modifying the capacity of nodes dynamically. When the capacity is reduced on a fully allocated node, we should handle it more gracefully. Per YARN-1011 parlance, we should demote these containers to being called opportunistic. Sometimes, this might not be possible/allowed and the capacity update should fail. We can discuss this more on YARN-291.
