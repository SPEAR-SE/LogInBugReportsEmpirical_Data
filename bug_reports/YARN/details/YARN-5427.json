So more or less we can say that default gets usedup then if node of partition X is free then it will assign in it.\nbq. In fact, my demand is jobs in queue A(batch data work) can use one partition as 'MR' and another partition as 'SPARK'(high memory) such as 100%*MR and 30%*SPARK. and jobs in queue B(ML jobs) can use 70%*SPARK. could i achieve this by now(2.8)?\nthis can be acheived in any version but sharing between *Spark -> default partition* or *MR -> default partition* depends on the type of SPARK and MR Partition . And this sharing is supported for Non Exclusive Partition from 2.8 only !\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-07-25T13:08:23.849+0000","updated":"2016-07-25T13:08:23.849+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12992192/comment/15391864","id":"15391864","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Feng+Yuan","name":"Feng Yuan","key":"feng yuan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897"},"displayName":"Feng Yuan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi all above is my configs,i can run a job which can get containers from partition x and partition default with this configs in hdp 2.7.2.\nI setup two nodes:\n                  node \"196\" have 6GB with label \"default\".\n                  node \"197\" have 6GB with label \"x\".\n                  in my configs,queue A have 100% resource of them two.\n                  and queue A`s default-node-label-expression is \"x\".(default empty dont work like below.)\n                  When i submit job in queue A,containers(one allcate 2GB) spread over 196 and 197 as the picture show.\n                  I think this  phenomenon  contrarys to what [~Naganarasimha]     says.\n                 And i cant run this scene in 2.8.\n                 How could i explain this?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Feng+Yuan","name":"Feng Yuan","key":"feng yuan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897"},"displayName":"Feng Yuan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-07-25T13:14:57.645+0000","updated":"2016-07-25T13:14:57.645+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12992192/comment/15391933","id":"15391933","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Feng+Yuan","name":"Feng Yuan","key":"feng yuan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=feng+yuan&avatarId=29897"},"displayName":"Feng Yuan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{quote}\nthis can be acheived in any version but sharing between Spark -> default partition or MR -> default partition depends on the type of SPARK and MR Partition .
