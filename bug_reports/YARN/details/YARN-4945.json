We should calculate apps' ideal allocation as well.\n- Configuration of intra-queue preemption: we should be able to turn on/off intra/inter queue preemption separately.\n- When intra-queue preemption can happen: in some cases, we need intra-queue preemption happen when queue is under its guaranteed resource, and we also need to make sure no excessive preemption (like crossfire between apps) happens.\n- Priorities of intra-queue preemption and inter-queue preemption.

This can be used as a reference to avoid double calculations in intra­queue preemption round.\n{quote}\nI'm pretty sure that the containers already in the {{selectedCandidates}} list will _not_ be re-assigned to anything in the current queue. The containers are in that list because some other queue is asking for them. Even if containers that are already in the inter-queue preemption list would also help resolve an intra-queue preemption problem, those containers will go to the more underserved queue before coming back to the current queue. My assertion is that regardless of what containers are already in the {{selectedCandidates}} list, the intra-queue preemption policy would always need to select more.\n\n-----\n{quote}\nConfigurations and considerations\n- Provide a configuration to turn on/off intra­queue preemption along with the type of policy it is going to handle (priority, fairness, user­limit etc)\n{quote}\nAdditionally, we may want to consider intra-queue preemption configs for dead zone, natural completion, etc. This may even need to be per queue.\n\n\n-----\n{quote}\n Select ideal candidates for intra­queue preemption per priority.\n...\n3. ‘pending’ resource per partition will be calculated for all the apps and together store in a consolidated map (resourceToObtain) of pending resource to be collected per partition in one queue.\n{quote}\nThe use of the word \"pending\" in conjunction with the reference to {{resourceToObtain}} is confusing to me. It sounds like \"pending\" is talking about \"preemptable resources,\" but \"pending\" means \"resources requested but not yet allocated.\" (See {{LeafQueue#getTotalPendingResourcesConsideringUserLimit}}).\n\nFor instance, the {{resToObtainByPartition}} variable in {{FifoCandidatesSelector}} is used for holding the amount of extra (and therefore preemptable) resources being used by a queue. Is this step calculating the total of preemptable resources for apps in this queue, per partition?\n\n-----\n{quote}\n4. While doing this, we will ensure that certains apps will be skipped if it is already equal or more that its user­limit quota.  This map will be the entry point to select candidates from lower priority apps in next step.\n{quote}\nIs this saying that, when marking containers for preemption, if an app is under its user limit percent, its containers will not be marked? Or, is it saying that if an app is asking for more containers and it is already over its user limit percent, other apps' containers won't be preempted on its behalf?\n\nNot only do we need to avoid preemptiong resources _for_ users that are over their user limit percent, we need to avoid preempting containers _from_ users that are under their user limit percent. Even today in the capacity scheuler, if I have a queue with a 50% user limit percent, and app1 from user1 is priority1 and app2 from user2 is priority2, and they are both asking for more resources, user2 will not get more containers until user1 has reached 50% of the queue. In other words, user limit percent trumps application priority.\n\n-----\nI am concerned that priority-based intra-queue preemption has a different set of goals than user limit percent-based intra-queue preemption. For instance,\n-  requirements for user limit percent-based preemption are calculated based at the user level, while priority-based preemption requirements go down to the app level.\n- User limit percent-based preemption only makes sense if multiple users are in a queue, and priority-based preemption only makes sense if a priority inversion can happen between apps of the same user in a queue.\n\nPerhaps these should be totally separate policies. Anyway, for us, user limit percent-based preemption is much more important.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-08-19T21:50:04.147+0000","updated":"2016-08-19T21:50:04.147+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12957920/comment/15429644","id":"15429644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.My assertion is that regardless of what containers are already in the selectedCandidates list, the intra-queue preemption policy would always need to select more.\nyes, I also meant that same. There are chances that intra-queue preemption logic may select a container whihc is already selected. So we will continue and deduct from intra-queue resourceToObtain and will continue. I added this point to emphasize that intra queue logic will not do anything to already selected container.\n\nbq.we may want to consider intra-queue preemption configs for dead zone, natural completion,\nMake sense. i will add this point\n\nbq.Is this step calculating the total of preemptable resources for apps in this queue, per partition?\nWhen we consider resource distribution in a queue, there can be resource over subscription consider the fact that there were no demand at that time when these resource were allocated to queue/app. Later at a point , few more apps came in and caused resource distribution variation based on priority or user-limit. In such cases, we will be  considering priority and user-limit  as separate. \n- priority : all pending resource requests for this app will become “resource to obtain for this app”\n- user-limit: may be partial or full pending resource request will become  “resource to obtain for this app”. This is depending on “user-limit_headroom - current_used”. This much can be considered as demand from this app.\nI used pending because of the notion from scheduler. But in preemption world, that will be mapped to resourceTo Obtain. \n\nAnd yes, we consider this resourceToObtain per partition level and all calculations are done as per same.\n\nbq.Is this saying that, when marking containers for preemption, if an app is under its user limit percent, its containers will not be marked?\nI can clarify this. intra-queue preemption will first calculate resourceTOObtain from those apps which are of high priority (user-limit: those apps which are over-subscribing resource which crosses its user-limit-quota at given instance). From  these selected apps, we get how much pending  is there and thus will contribute as resourceToObtain (user-limit: in this case, we find those apps which are starving and not getting its user-limit-quota).\n\nIN these cases, we will come across apps which is already met / more than its user-limit quota (for priority). So these apps will be skipped and it will be attribute to resourceToObtain.\n\nbq.Perhaps these should be totally separate policies.\nMy idea is to come with IntraQueue framework and apply policies like priority and user-limit on top of that. So with this poc, i am coming with framework and priority preemption. user-limit can be be added as new policy on top of this framework. And it will be having the points which are mentioned by you. However for doc, it will be goof if we could have it common for priority and user-limit. And we can add the point which you have given in comment to doc. This will give a better insight for intra-queue preemption.

I have looked the doc as well. Few comments from my end\n\n1.\n{noformat}\nWhen one (or more) user(s) are below their minimun-user-limit-percent and one (or\nmore) user(s) are above their minimum-user-limit-percent, resources will be\npreempted after a configurable time period from the user(s) which are above their minimumuser-limit-percent.\n{noformat}\n>>I think we might need to come with a limit on how much resource can be preempted from over-utilizing users's apps. WE do have max-preemption-per-round. But sometimes it may be more as it may be configured for inter-queue. Since we are sharing this config, i think we can have a config to limit the preemption for user-limit. For priority, i have considered a certain limit to control this scenario. Thoughts?\n\n\n\n2.\n{noformat}\nApp0 in QUEUE0 is consuming 50 extra resources and is not releasing them. But,\nsince QUEUE0 is not preemptable, inter-queue preemption will not free the 50\nresources from QUEUE0. In QUEUE1, User2 is guaranteed 50 resources, but\nUser1 is also, and User1 is not going over its minimum-user-limitpercent,\nso User1 is not violating any policy. Therefore, the user-limit-percentintra-queue-preemption\npolicy does not preempt any resources from User1.\n{noformat}\n>> Overall this point make sense. This is strictly intra-queue model and we need not have to consider across queue demand and its shortages.\n\n\n3.\n{noformat}\n1.3.1.3.1. TBD: I could see this going the other way. That is, we may want the\npolicy to preempt from App1 until both users have an equal number of\nresources. \n{noformat}\n>> I mostly agree with you here. Once app1's containers are released, app2 can get resources. CS will ensure same, I dont think preemption module need to do that.\n\n4.\nbq.Should there be some (possibly configurable) limit on the percent of containers preempted from App1? \nInstead of limiting from each app, I consider only a certain % of high priority app's demand. This can help to avoid over preemption cases. If we limit preempting container from an app, a higher priority app may loose some container. So for now, its better to clear lowest priority apps completely except its AM. On same line, apps could save some of its containers (critical, long running). For this, app itself can mark such containers.

Such apps will be skipped while calculating demand. I have added this support in POC patch itself.\n\nOverall these cases make sense, and thank you very much or sharing same.

Its a really a case to consider.\n\nWhile working on POC, [~leftnoteasy] has mentioned about a case of normalization. We have to consider that inter-queue preemption is done while doing preemption calculation and selection for intra-queue. In the initial version of POC, i tried to achieve the basic framework and a working prototype. But for the version, we need to normalize pre-selected containers before each round in intra-queue preemption. (i think we can consider user-limit and priority only for now)\nOn the same note, we also need to consider case where selected containers are not rejected in subsequent rounds. Also if same containers are again re-selected in next rounds, we can consider those containers are already selected and deduct from resourceToObtain. These cases are handled as of today. \n\nI think I can add the impl details of this scenario also in the document so that it can come in first cut.

as what you described\nStep 5 will not happen because there's 10 containers marked for preemption already.\n\nSo Step 4 will be repeated until:\n\n{code}\nQueue 1:\n   User1, Used=100, Pending=50\n   User2, Used=0, Pending=50\nQueue 2: Used=100,\n{code}\n\nOnce the inter-queue resource usage back to balanced, intra-queue preemption policy can start to preempt resources.\n\nSo the Step 5 will be:\n\n{code}\n10 container marked to be preemption for User1 from Queue 1, and after these container preempted, they will be picked up by User2 from Queue 1.\n{code}\n\n[~sunilg] please add your

I'm not sure of the best way to do that, but our users don't use application priority very much.\n\nPerhaps {{CapacitySchedulerConfiguration}} could have something like:\n{code}\n  /**\n   * For intra-queue preemption, priority based selector can help to preempt\n   * containers of lowest priority apps to find resources for high priority\n   * apps.\n   */\n  public static final String PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_APP_PRIORITY =\n      PREEMPTION_CONFIG_PREFIX + \"select_based_on_priority_of_applications\";\n  public static final boolean DEFAULT_PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_APP_PRIORITY = false;\n\n  /**\n   * For intra-queue preemption, minimum-user-limit-percent based selector can\n   * help to preempt containers to ensure users are not starved of their\n   * guaranteed percentage of a queue.\n   */\n  public static final String PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_USER_PERCENT_GUARANTEE =\n      PREEMPTION_CONFIG_PREFIX + \"select_based_on_user_percentage_guarantee\";\n  public static final boolean DEFAULT_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_USER_PERCENT_GUARANTEE = false;\n\n{code}\n\nAnd then {{ProportionalCapacityPreemptionPolicy#init}} can turn on intra-queue preemption if either one is set:\n{code}\n    boolean selectIntraQueuePreemptCandidatesByPriority = csConfig.getBoolean(\n        CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_APP_PRIORITY,\n        CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.DEFAULT_PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_APP_PRIORITY);\n    boolean selectIntraQueuePreemptCandidatesByUserPercentGuarantee = csConfig.getBoolean(\n        CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.PREEMPTION_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_USER_PERCENT_GUARANTEE,\n        CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.DEFAULT_SELECT_INTRAQUEUE_CANDIDATES_BY_USER_PERCENT_GUARANTEE);\n    if (selectIntraQueuePreemptCandidatesByPriority || selectIntraQueuePreemptCandidatesByUserPercentGuarantee) {\n      candidatesSelectionPolicies.add(new IntraQueueCandidatesSelector(this));\n    }\n{code}\n\nThen, in {{IntraQueueCandidatesSelector}} logic could be added to do either one or both intra-queue preemption policies. What do you think?\n\\\\\n\\\\\n----\n\\\\\n- Could headroom check allow priority inversion?\n\n{{PriorityIntraQueuePreemptionPolicy#getResourceDemandFromAppsPerQueue}}:\n{code}\n  // Can skip apps which are already crossing user-limit.\n  // For this, Get the userlimit from scheduler and ensure that app is\n  // not crossing userlimit here.

For example, in a situation like the following, {{App1}} from {{User1}} is already taking up all of the resources, so its headroom is 0. But, since {{App2}} is also from {{User1}}, the above code will never allow preemption to occur.

I cannot clearly think what it means in semantic, one example is, after we have user-limit preemption support, what happens if we only enable the user-limit preemption (without priority preemption enabled)?\n\n2) PCPP:\n- Unused imports / methods\n- getPartitionResource: avoid clone resources? Because we will clone resource twice for every app. If you concern about consistency, you can clone it once before starting preemption calculation\n- It seems to me, partitionToUnderServedQueues can be kept in AbstractPreemptableResourceCalculator.\nIn addition, Map<String, LinkedHashSet<String>> could be Map<String, List<String>>. (LinkedHashSet is not necessarily needed, because we won't have two TempQueuePerPartition with the same queueName and same partition)\n\n3) CapacitySchedulerPreemptionUtils:\n- deductPreemptableResourcePerApp, is following a valid comment?\nbq. // High priority app is coming first \n- Remove unnecessary param in method and new generic type (like new HashMap(...)), better to move to Intellij? :p\n- {getResToObtainByPartitionForApps}} can be removed, we can directly use policy.getResourceDemandFromAppsPerQueue\n\n4) FiCaSchedulerApp: \nMvoe getTotalPendingRequestsPerPartition to ResourceUsage? I can see we could have requirements to: getUsedResourceByPartition, getReservedReosurceByPartition, etc. in the future\n\n5) PreemptionCandidatesSelector:\n- All non-abstract methods can be static, correct?\n- All TODOs in comments are done, correct?\n\n6) IntraQueuePreemptionPolicy and PriorityIntraQueuePreemptionPolicy:\n- Overall: Do you think if the name: -Policy is too big? What it essentially do is computing how much resource to preempt from each app, how about call it something like IntraQueuePreemptionComputePlugin? Would like to hear thoughts from you and Eric for this as well.\n- Rename the PriorityIntraQueuePreemptionPolicy to FifoIntraQueuePreemptionPolicy if you agree with [my comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-4945?focusedCommentId=15494454&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-15494454]\n- PriorityIntraQueuePreemptionPolicy#getResourceDemandFromAppsPerQueue: \na. resToObtainByPartition can be removed from parameter\nb. IIUC, it gets resourceToObtain for each app instead of gets resourceDemand for each app, rename it properly?\nc. This logic is not correct:\n{code}\n        // If demand is from same priority level, skip the same.\n        if (!tq.isPendingDemandForHigherPriorityApps(a1.getPriority())) {\n          continue;\n        }\n{code} \nIt can only avoid highest priority in a queue applications preempt from each other, but it cannot avoid 2nd highest applications from each other. And the performance can be improved as well, I believe in some settings, maxAppPriority can be as much as MAX_INT. Please look for below comments/pesudo code for details.\n- computeAppsIdealAllocation:\na. Calling getUserLimitHeadRoomPerApp is too expensive, instead we can add one method in LeafQueue to get UserLimit by userName. Have a Map of username to headroom inside the method can compute user limit at most once for different user. And this logic can be reused to compute user-limit preemption\nb. {{tq.addPendinResourcePerPriority(tmpApp.getPriority(), tmpApp.pending);}} could be changed if you agree with above .c\nc. I think we should move the {{skip the same priority demand}} logic into this method. One approach in my mind is:\n{code}\n// General idea:\n// Use two pointer, one from most prioritized app, one from least prioritized app\n// Each app has two quotas, one is how much resource required (ideal - used),\n// Another one is how much resource can be preempted\n// Move the two pointer and update the two quotas to get:\n// For application X, is there any app with higher priority need the resource?\n\np1 = most-prioritized-app.iterator\np2 = least-prioritized-app.iterator\n\n// For each app, we have:\n// - \"toPreemptFromOther\" which initialized to (ideal - (used - selected)).\n// - \"actuallyToBePreempted\" initialized to 0\n\nwhile (p1.getPriority() > p2.getPriority() && p1 != p2) {\n    Resource rest = p2.toBePreempt - p2.actuallyToBePreempted;\n    if (rest > 0) {\n        if (p1.toBePreemptFromOther > 0) {\n        \tResource toPreempt = min(p1.toBePreemptFromOther, rest);\n        \tp1.toBePreemptFromOther -= toPreempt\n        \tp2.actuallyToBePreempted += toPreempt\n        }\n\t}\n\n\tif (p2.toBePreempt - p2.actuallyToBePreempted == 0) {\n        // Nothing more can be preempt from p2, move to next\n        p2 --;    \n\t}\n\n\tif (p1.toBePreemptFromOther == 0) {\n\t    // p1 is satisified, move to next\n\t    p1 ++;\n\t}\n}\n{code}\nd. After change c. getResourceDemandFromAppsPerQueue will simply return actuallyToPreempted for apps in a queue groupped by partition\n\n7) TempAppPerQueue:\n- It should be TempAppPerPartition\n- Is it possible to add a common class for app/queue to avoid dup logic?\n- Is it better to rename Temp- to something like AppPartitionSnapshot or QueuePartitionSnapshot?

Have a Map of username to headroom inside the method can compute user limit at most once for different user. And this logic can be reused to compute user-limit preemption\nMaybe we are talking about the same thing, but I just want to clarify that I am not advocating preemption based on headroom (user-limit-factor). I am advocating based on minimum user limit percent (MULP), which is the minimum guaranteed resource amount per user per queue.\n\n{quote}\nTo be honest, I haven't thought a good way that a list of policies can better solve the priority + user-limit preemption problem. Could you share some ideas about it. For example, how to better consider both in the final decision\n{quote}\nI believe that the two preemption policies (priority and minimum-user-limit-percent) are _mostly_ (but not completely) separate. I would say that priority preemption only considers apps from the same user, and MULP preemption only considers apps from different users.\n\nIf you look at the behavior of the capacity scheduler, I was surprised to find that it mostly ignores priority when assigning resources between apps of different users. I conducted the following experiment, without turning on preemption:\n\n# The cluster has only 1 queue, and it takes up all of the resources.\n||Queue Name||Total Containers||{{user-limit-factor}}||{{minimum-user-limit-percent}}||Priority Enabled||\n|default|24|1.0 (each user can take up the whole queue if no other users are present)|0.25 (if other users are present, each user is guaranteed at least 25% of the queue's resources; at max, 4 users can have apps in the queue at once; if less than 4 users, the scheduler tries to balance resources evenly between users)|false|\n# {{user1}} starts {{app1}} in {{default}} of {{priority1}} and consumes all resources\n# {{user2}} starts {{app2}} in {{default}} of {{priority2}}.\n||User Name||App Name||App Priority||Used Containers||Pending Containers||\n|user1|app1|1|24|76|\n|user2|app2|2|0|100|\n# I kill 12 containers from {{app1}} and the capacity scheduler assigns them to {{app2}}. Not because {{app2}} has a higher priority than {{app1}}, but because {{user2}} is using less resources than {{user1}} (the capacity scheduler tries to balance resources between users).\n||User Name||App Name||App Priority||Used Containers||Pending Containers||\n|user1|app1|1|12|76|\n|user2|app2|2|12|76|\n# At this point, what should happen if I kill another container from {{app1}}? Since {{app2}} is higher priority than {{app1}}, and since MULP is 25% (so {{user2}}'s minimum guarantee is only 6), you might think that the capacity scheduler will give it to {{app2}} (that's what I thought it would do). _But it doesn't!_ The capacity scheduler gives the container back to {{app1}} because it wants to balance the resources between all users.  And the table remains the same:\n||User Name||App Name||App Priority||Used Containers||Pending Containers||\n|user1|app1|1|12|76|\n|user2|app2|2|12|76|\n\nOnce the users are balanced, no matter how many times I kill a container from {{app1}}, it always goes back to {{app1}}. From a priority perspective, this could be considered an inversion, since {{app2}} is asking for more resources and {{app1}} is well above its MULP. But the capacity scheduler does not consider priority in this case.\n\nIf I try the same experiment, but with both apps owned by {{user1}}, then I can kill all of {{app1}}'s containers (except the AM) and they all get assigned to {{app2}}\n\nBecause the capacity scheduler behaves this way, I would recommend that the MULP preemption policy run first and try to balance each user's ideal assigned. The MULP policy would preempt from lowest priority first, so it would consider priority of apps owned by other, over-served users when deciding what to preempt, and consider priority of apps owned by the current, under-served user, when deciding ideal-assigned values.\n\nThen, I would run the priority policy but only consider apps within each user. As shown above, once the users are balanced between each other with regard to MULP, trying to kill containers from higher priority apps of other users will only cause preemption churn.\n\n[~leftnoteasy], as you said, we may be able to combine the two into one policy, and you may be right that this can be done without being too complicated. The thing I want to ensure is that the priority preemption policy doesn't try to kill high priority containers from different users that will only be reassigned back to the original user and cause preemption churn.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-09-16T18:32:54.760+0000","updated":"2016-09-16T18:32:54.760+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12957920/comment/15497045","id":"15497045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~leftnoteasy] and [~eepayne]\n\nLeafQueue#getAllApplications impl had that bug pointed by Eric.
