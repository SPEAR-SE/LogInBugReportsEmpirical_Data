The same protection can be covered by RMAuthenticationFilter.  It doesn't seem to cause harm when this is going through RMAuthenticationFilter path.  I am not sure if proxyserver should or should not issue DT when it is embedded on RM.  Thoughts?\r\n\r\n{quote}Should the proxy service even be using the RM's auth filter?{quote}\r\n2.  Probably for embedded case.  Both /proxy and /cluster can be configured to two different HTTP principals.  This might be problematic when checking if TGS session key is granted properly because the service principal names are the same on the same service port, but it appears there is two TGS session key initialized by Hadoop code to cause this problem.\r\n\r\n{quote}How/why does changing addFilter to addGlobalFilter fix the problem? Adding the filter to every context (even those explicitly registered to not be filtered) seems counterintuitive.{quote}\r\n3.  The global coverage ensures that all entry points are served by the same TGS session key.  Hence, it doesn't confuse Kerberos that there are two kerberos sessions initialized.\r\n\r\n{quote}I think we also need to root cause exactly what change caused the RM auth filter to be double registered so we can ensure we've correctly fixed the bug.{quote}\r\n\r\nI tried to peel the code to see if we can eliminate one of the registration, but it appears that we have spotty kerberos coverage when that happens.  The amount of code reuse make it impossible to decouple the threads and regroup them in the timely manner.  The trade off between refactoring httpServer2 code to get filter initialization configuration correct for special case vs global coverage of the same TGS session key.

I tried to reduce RMAuthenticationFilter to 1, and discover that it still has conflict between /proxy and /cluster.  I tried to disable SpnegoFilter, then /proxy become insecure.\r\n\r\nIn YARN-1553, webproxy was converted to use HttpServer2.Builder.  This change picked up webproxy initSpnego filter.  \r\nIn YARN-1482, code was modified to allow WebAppProxy to run in RM.  In HADOOP-10075 + HADOOP-10703 are written to apply handlers > context > filter > servlet globally.  Existing code which doesn't have handler applied, defineFilter applies to context.  This is all working fine, if there is only one context that enclosing all hadoop logic.  However, if multiple webapps are put on the same server, older code written pre-dated HADOOP-10703 may have separated context initialized with separated AuthenticationFilter that would result in request is a replay error.  \r\n\r\nA couple problems with Hadoop code misuse of web application:\r\n- Servlet code are setup to be context.  Context should be RM, webproxy, timelineserver.  Today, it is cluster, logs, static.\r\n- YARN servlet logic are written as Filter.\r\n- Handler logic are written as Filter.\r\n- Filter are applied to wildcard path and assuming it is applied globally, which may not be true.\r\n\r\nThis problem appears to have existed since creation of HttpServer2 and getting more complex to manage with introduction of jetty 9 upgrade.  A few JIRA like YARN-2397 are attempts to band-aid the general code reuse and specialized AuthenticationFilter.  Each of the pieces were evolved independently, and there was no conflicts until everything is put into RM.  One possible solution is to rewrite RMAuthenticationFilter, and AuthenticationFilter to become AuthenticationHandler, and it is applied globally.  This would be the same as turning RMAuthenticationFilter into a global Filter.\r\n\r\nI am not 100% sure if RMAuthenticationFilter should oversee all Kerberos login activity when proxyserver is in embedded mode, but I am more inclined to make it so after analyze the code.  I post here to see if anyone who are more familiar with YARN code base can shed some lights on best approach to address this issue.\r\n\r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-04-19T17:59:25.584+0000","updated":"2018-04-19T17:59:25.584+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13149605/comment/16461562","id":"16461562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=billie.rinaldi","name":"billie.rinaldi","key":"billie.rinaldi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233"},"displayName":"Billie Rinaldi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I took a look into the issue and am feeling okay about the conservative fix of making RMAuthenticationFilter global whenever it is enabled.

Chrome, IE, and Firefox all shares the similar logic.  Firefox and IE don't allow canonical DNS to prevent MITM attack.  Safari and Chrome supports canonical DNS with options to disable canonical DNS.\r\n\r\nFrom Server point of view, a single server can host multiple virtual hosts with different web applications.  This is technically possible to configure web server to run with multiple SPN.  It is incorrect to assume that same virtual host can serve two different SPN for two different subset of URLs.  All browsers do not support subset of URLs to be served by one SPN, while other subset of URLs to be served by another SPN.\r\n  \r\nIn Hadoop 0.2x, Hadoop components are designed to serve a collection of servlets (log, static, cluster) per port.  Therefore, AuthenticationFilter can cover the entire port by targeting the fixed set of servlet for filtering, that matches browser expectation without problem.  AuthenticationFilter was later reused in Hadoop 1.x and 2.x as Kerberos SPNEGO filter.\r\n\r\nThe current problem is only surfaced when multiple web contexts are configured to share on the same port with same server hostname, and each web contexts tried to initialize its own SPN.  This is not by design and it just happened due to code reuse and lack of testing.  For Hadoop 2.x+ to offer embedded services securely, the individual AuthenticationFilter can be turned into one [security handler|http://www.eclipse.org/jetty/documentation/9.3.x/architecture.html#_handlers] to match Jetty design specification.  This fall through the crack in open source when no one is looking because the first security mechanism for Hadoop was to implement a XSS filter (was committed as part of Chukwa) instead of security handler.  Unfortunately, Hadoop security mechanisms followed the bottom up approach to implement as filter instead of following web application design to write security handler as Handlers.  Due to lack of understanding that session persistence require authentication and authorization security mechanism to be built differently from web filters.\r\n\r\nThe one line change is to loop through all Context and ensure all contexts are registered with the same AuthenticationFilter to apply one filter globally to all URLs.  This is the reason that this one line patch can plug this security hole in the short term bug fix.  The long term solution is writing security handler to match handler design to ensure no API breakage during jetty version upgrade and improve session persistence in Hadoop web applications, which is beyond the scope of this JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-05-14T17:30:59.002+0000","updated":"2018-05-14T17:30:59.002+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13149605/comment/16481207","id":"16481207","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"cc [~rkanter] and [~tucu00] \r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eyang","name":"eyang","key":"eyang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Yang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-05-18T21:20:38.026+0000","updated":"2018-05-18T21:20:38.026+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13149605/comment/16483464","id":"16483464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~eyang] and [~kbadani],\r\n\r\nWould you please confirm that this jira is a blocker for 3.0.3 release?

prevent security filter to be applied multiple times.Â  I will commit this to branch 3.1 and trunk in a few hours if there is no objections.Â  Hadoop 3.0.x is removed from the target version because
