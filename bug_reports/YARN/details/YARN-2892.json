If they are indeed the same user then it includes the AMRMToken, otherwise it does not include it.\n\nThe problem arises from the fact that when an application is submitted, the RM  saves the short username of the user who created the application (See submitApplication in ClientRmService). Afterwards when the ApplicationReport is requested, the system tries to match the full username of the requester against the previously stored short username. \n\nIn a secure cluster using Kerberos this check fails because the principle is stripped from the username when we request a short username. So for example the short username might be \"Foo\" whereas the full username is \"Foo@Company.com\"\n\nNote: A very similar problem has been previously reported

Since we'd rather not modify the public interface of RMApp, maybe we should continue passing in the full username to _createAndGetApplicationReport_ and prior to AMRM security check we can use this full username to construct a short username. It seems a bit hacky but I'm not sure how else we can avoid not breaking the public interface. \n\nThe easiest way I can see doing this is by using something like the following:\n\n{code}\nUserGroupInformation remoteUser = UserGroupInformation.getRemoteUser(clientUserName);\nString shortUsername = remoteUser.getShortUsername();\n{code}\n\nAnother solution could be to do the following:\n\n{code}\n//if security is set to kerberos...\nHadoopKerberosName kbName = new HadoopKerberosName(clientUserName);\nString shortUsername = kbName.getShortUsername()\n{code} \n\nThe first solution is a bit strange but looks more attractive to me as it allows _RMAppImpl_ to stay agnostic to the underlying security framework.
