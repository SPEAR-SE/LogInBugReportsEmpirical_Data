Does it makes sense to add the memory monitoring flags as separate bits of information? \n      - this could allow a function like isPhysicalMemoryCheckEnabled to just return the flag instead of overloading the totalPMemValue when monitoring is disabled. \n   - is this needed: s/YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_PMEM_MB) * 1024 * 1024/YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_PMEM_MB) * 1024 * 1024L/ ? ( missing long qualifier on the last 1024 ) ? \n \n\n\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-20T21:29:33.564+0000","updated":"2013-03-20T21:29:33.564+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12636699/comment/13608427","id":"13608427","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the review Hitesh.
