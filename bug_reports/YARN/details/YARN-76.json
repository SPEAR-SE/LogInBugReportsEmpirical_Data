This command is executed in a process (say with PID 0001), which starts another Java process (say with PID 0002). When NM kills the AM, it send SIGTERM and then SIGKILL to the bash process (PID 0001). In Linux, the death of the bash process (PID 0001) will trigger the kill of the Java process (PID 0002). However, in Mac OS, only the bash process is killed.
