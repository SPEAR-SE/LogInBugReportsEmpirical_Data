MapReduce history requires the MapReduce ApplicationMaster to generate the history when it completes.  hadoop job -kill or mapred job -kill accomplishes the kill by having the client connect to the MapReduce ApplicationMaster for the job and asks it to kill the job.  Since this goes through the ApplicationMaster it allows the history to be generated properly.\n\nWhen the kill is done via YARN then the ApplicationMaster is not involved.  The ResourceManager kills the AM without the AM's knowledge.  This is similar to kill vs. kill -9 (i.e.: SIGTERM vs SIGKILL) in POSIX.  The former allows the application to perform cleanup tasks on the way down, while the latter mercilessly kills the process without any chance for cleanup.\n\nSince YARN does not allow the application to specify a cleanup task to be performed when the app dies the MapReduce framework doesn't get a chance to finish generating the history for the job.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-07-19T15:17:19.168+0000","updated":"2016-07-19T15:17:19.168+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12990606/comment/15384516","id":"15384516","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mnikhil","name":"mnikhil","key":"mnikhil","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikhil Mulley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"So, should apps always use app specific methods to kill their jobs but never use yarn kill unless really necessary.
