It should be a rare occurrence, and log availability is already a best-effort rather than guaranteed service.  Even if we try to retain the logs it has questionable benefit in practice, as the history of a job always points to the aggregated logs, not the node's copy of the logs, and thus the logs will still be \"lost\" from the end-user's point of view.  Savvy users may realize the logs could still be on the original node, but most won't know to check there or how to form the URL to find them.  If we always point to the node then that defeats one of the features of log aggregation, since loss of the node will mean the node's URL is bad and we fail to show the logs even if they are aggregated.\n\nSo for now I say we keep it simple and just cleanup the files on errors to prevent leaks.  Speaking of which I took a look at the patch.  It will fix the particular error we saw with TFiles, but there could easily be other non-IOExceptions that creep out of the code, especially as it is maintained over time.
