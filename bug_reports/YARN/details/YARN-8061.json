Assume there are 4 apps a1, a2, a3, a4 inside, who demand 3G, 2G, 1G, and 0.5G. a1 gets 3G minshare-starved resources, a2 gets 2G, a3 get 1G, they are all considered as starved apps except a4 who doesn't get any. \r\n\r\nAn app can preempt another under the same queue due to minshare starvation. For example, a1 can preempt a4 if a4 uses more resources than its fair share, which is 3G(12G/4). If a1 itself used more than 3G memory, it will preempt itself! I will create a unit test later. \r\n\r\nThe solution would check application's fair share while distributing minshare starvation, more details in method {{FSLeafQueue#updateStarvedAppsMinshare()}}.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"An application may preempt itself in case of minshare preemption","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yufeigu","name":"yufeigu","key":"yufeigu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240"},"displayName":"Yufei Gu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yufeigu","name":"yufeigu","key":"yufeigu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=yufeigu&avatarId=31240"},"displayName":"Yufei Gu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-8061/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3rmif:"}}
