The MapReduce ApplicationMaster kills tasks as soon as they report success via the umbilical connection, and sometimes that kill arrives before the task exits on its own.  In those cases the containers will be marked as killed by the ApplicationMaster.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-05-12T13:45:36.955+0000","updated":"2014-05-12T13:45:36.955+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613178/comment/13996054","id":"13996054","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=deepujain","name":"deepujain","key":"deepujain","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Deepak Kumar V","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"In my case the reducers were moved to COMPLETED state after 22 mins, they had reached 100% progress at 15 mins.

In my case the reducers were moved to COMPLETED state after 22 mins, they had reached 100% progress at 15 mins.\n\nHaving progress reach 100% but the task not completing for 7 more minutes is an unrelated issue.
