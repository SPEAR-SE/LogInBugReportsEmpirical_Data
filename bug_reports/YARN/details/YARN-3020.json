I did not follow the log past this introduction of AMRMClient.java in its present form and location.\n\nIn my code on my system (and I am supposing also in yours) each addContainerRequest() is taking about a second even without a sleep.  The heartbeat I set in createAMRMClientAsync() was 1000 milliseconds (1 second), so I set it to 10 seconds to rule out that the addContainerRequest() was somehow synchronous with allocate().  FWIW, for 10 containers requested, I got 17 containers with a heartbeat of 10 seconds.  One heartbeat call to allocate() produced 7 containers, the next call produced 10.  Each heartbeat on which the AMRMClient detects a change (in the number of containers the AM has \"add\"ed) that needs to be sent to the RM, it sends the then-current total not the diff.\n\nLimiting the AM to ~1 container request per second is impractical, so the bug is potentially initially helpful because the application does not have to wait 2 minutes to assemble 100 containers, all it needs to do is call addContainerRequest() about 15 times, taking about 15 seconds with a 1 second heartbeat.  The addContainerRequest() performance will need to be improved, or the limitation of 1 container per addContainerRequest() introduced in r1503960 2013-07-16 will need to be reversed.\n\nBut by the time one naively requests 100 containers, and get 5,050, The bug is probably hurting application and cluster performance.

Bear in mind that the elapsed time for making the client-api call to addContainerRequest() is not a measurement of the performance impact of the reported over-requests sent to the server and the resulting over-allocation of containers. It turns out my application has some extrinsic delay in issuing addContainerRequests which predominated in limiting the rate I measured and reported in the third paragraph of the comment immediately above.\n\nTo follow up, I measured addContainerRequest() timing with System.nanoTime().  The first call to addContainerRequest() takes around 5 milliseconds.  The rest take around half a millisecond on average.  Here are some statistics for calling addContainerRequest():  microseconds average=433 count=914 max=11202 min=223 .  I measure similar times for consecutive calls (without additional application delays in between addContainerRequest()s).\n\nWhen the over-request bug is fixed, I will still think it tedious to call 1000x for 1000 identical containers but many applications can probably afford the half second to do so.

You may think container has priority, capacity and resourceName, so that AMRMClient can get ResourceRequest via {{getMatchingRequests}}. But it is possible some applications may use the container for other propose (AMRMClient cannot understand application's specific logic). So AM should call {{removeContainerRequest}} itself.\n\nTo improve this, I think 1) we need add this behavior to YARN doc -- people should better understand how to use AMRMClient. And 2) maybe we should add a default implementation to deduct pending resource requests by prioirty/resource-name/capacity of allocated containers automatically (User can disable this default behavior, implement their own logic to deduct pending resource requests.)\n\nDoes this make sense to you?\n\nThanks,\nWangda","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-20T21:29:09.255+0000","updated":"2015-01-20T21:29:09.255+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12765864/comment/14285984","id":"14285984","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ywskycn","name":"ywskycn","key":"ywskycn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wei Yan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi, [~peterdkirchner], try to understand clearly your point.

The problem here is that if there are only removes for allocated containers, then the server-side bookkeeping is correct until the client sends the total.  The removes called for incoming assigned containers should not be forwarded to the RM until there is at least one matching add, or a bona-fide removal of a previously add-ed request.\n\nI suppose the current implementation could be defended because its error is:\n\t1) \"only\" too high by the number of matching incoming assignments,\n\t2) persists \"only\" for the number of heartbeats it takes to clear the out of sync condition\n\t3) results in spurious allocations \"only\" once the application's intentional matching requests were granted.\nI maintain that spurious allocations are worst-case and especially damaging if obtained by preemption.\n\nI want to suggest an alternative that is simpler and accurate, and limited to the AMRMClient and RM. The fact that the scheduler is updated by replacement informs the choice of where Yarn should calculate that total for a matching request.\nThe client is in a position to accurately calculate how much its current wants differ from what it has asked for over its life.\nThis suggests a fix to the synchronization problem by having the client send the net of add/remove requests it has accumulated over a heartbeat cycle,\nand having the RM update its totals, from the difference obtained from the client, using synchronized methods.\n(Note, this client would not ordinarily call remove when it received a container, as the scheduler has already\nproperly accounted for it when it made the allocation).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peterdkirchner","name":"peterdkirchner","key":"peterdkirchner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Peter

D Kirchner","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Hi Wei Yan,\nMy point, adjusted to take the \"expected usage\" into account, is that when matching requests and/or allocations are spread over multiple heartbeats, too many containers are requested and received.\n\nSo, suppose my application calls addContainerRequest() 10 times.\n\nLet's take your example where the AMRMClient sends 1 container request on heartbeat 1, and 10 requests at heartbeat 2, overwriting the 1.\nSay also that the second RPC returns with 1 container.\n\nThe second request is high by one, i.e. 10, because the application does not yet know about the incoming allocation.\nSubsequent updates are also high by approximately the number of incoming containers.\nMy application heartbeat is 1 second and the RM is typically allocating 1 container/node/second so I'd expect 10 containers coming in on the third heartbeat.\nPer expected usage, my AMRMClient would have sent out an updated request for 9 containers at that time.\nMy application would zero-out the matching request on the fourth heartbeat and release the nine extra containers (90% more) that it received that it never intended to request.  \n\nIn the present implementation, with the AMRMClient keeping track of the totals, removeContainerRequest() properly decrements AMRMClient's idea of the outstanding count.\nBut due to this information being a heartbeat out of date vs. the scheduler's, (pending a definitive fix) a partial fix would be that the AMRMClient should not routinely update the RM with this matching total, whenever the scheduler's tally is likely to be more accurate.\nOccasions when the RM should be updated are when there is a new matching addContainerRequest(), i.e. the scheduler's target could otherwise be too low, or when the AMRMClient's outstanding count is decremented to zero.\n\n\nPlease see my response to Wangda Tan 30 Jan 2015.\nThank you.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peterdkirchner","name":"peterdkirchner","key":"peterdkirchner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Peter
