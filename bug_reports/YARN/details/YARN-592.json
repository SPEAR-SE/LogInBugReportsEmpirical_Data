Node Manager graceful Shutdown\n     If we shutdown NM while running job, it is aggregating for all the containers in it and renaming the .tmp aggregate file. After the NM starts again, it is creating the .tmp aggregate file and doing the aggregation for the completed containers.  And finally it is not renaming this .tmp file because aggregate file already exist. When we try access logs fior tasks, it gives for the tasks which all executed before NM goes down.\n \n2. Node Manager abrupt kill : \n   If we kill NM while running job after running some containers, it is having the .tmp aggregate file for the application on that host. After restart it is overwriting the existing .tmp file and continuing the aggregation with this. After completing the aggregation for that job, it contains the logs for the tasks which executed after restart. Here it doesn't contain the tasks which got executed before the NM goes down. And also after aggregation it deletes the logs directory from the  local log dir. \n\nIn the attached patch, you can find the fix for these two above cases.\n\n   1. If the aggregate file already exist, then creating .tmp file and copying the previously aggregated logs into new .tmp file and deleting the old aggregated file.\n   \n   2. If the .tmp aggregate file already exist, after completion of the application reading the container logs from the local log dirs and aggregating for the containers which has not yet done.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-17T11:19:48.577+0000","updated":"2013-05-17T11:19:48.577+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643561/comment/13702823","id":"13702823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ojoshi","name":"ojoshi","key":"ojoshi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634"},"displayName":"Omkar Vinit Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just looked at your patch....

Graceful shutdown of NM and start again \n2. NM Crash(or abrupt kill) and start again \n\n\nbq.•are you assuming that after nm restarts application for which containers were running on that node manager will again get new container on the same node manager? at present NM doesn't remember the applications which were running on it across restart. Also RM doesn't inform NM about all the running applications in the cluster.\nYes, This Jira is mainly to address the case where containers running for the same application before and after NM restart. It is the important case because NM gets the application completed event and deletes the all container logs(including the container logs which ran before crash) for that application, and those logs(not aggregated) will not be available in the HDFS as explained in the previous comment. If NM doesn't get application completed event from RM then the logs atleast will be availble in the local logs dir.\n \nbq.•Now across NM restart applications might be still running or it might have just finished before restart. Do you want to upload the logs for both scenarios? at present we upload logs only when application finishes...\nThis patch is trying to upload logs for the applications which run before and after NM restart. If the application gets completed after NM crash and before starting NM, atleast logs for the containers ran on that node can get from NM local logs dirs. \n\nIf the NM gets stopped properly, presently NM uploads logs for all the running containers before going down. This case we may not need to handle anything.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-09T11:20:27.649+0000","updated":"2013-07-09T11:20:27.649+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643561/comment/13706495","id":"13706495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ojoshi","name":"ojoshi","key":"ojoshi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ojoshi&avatarId=16634"},"displayName":"Omkar Vinit Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just to be sure I might be wrong.... I am bit skeptical about .tmp file... are you sure it contains all the logs? My understanding is that it was still in the process and didn't finish with all.
