To make incompatible changes, we need to deprecate it for a major release first. In that sense, we should do a fix for trunk as well. I am open to adding a new notion of API compatibility for class extensions, and call out potential incompatibilities on major releases. I am also open to adding a new annotation called Extendable if we think that is helpful. \n\nIn the patch, the methods throw UnsupportedException. I had suggested this in an offline discussion with Sangjin, but I am not sure about it now. With this update, the downstream classes would continue to compile. This, however, can lead to RuntimeExceptions which is likely worse than compile time issues. I guess it depends on whether these methods end up being called. I can't think of a good solution, but thought I should bring this up.

No subclass/user of this class that exists today would be affected because they do not invoke the new methods as obviously they don't know the new methods. The only downside is later if a new subclass is created and forgets to override these methods (which will not be caught by the compiler). But then I suppose these classes are not really to be subclassed by users of Hadoop other than test or mock cases.\n\nAnother way to solve it would be to provide real implementations that would work for all cases.

If someone subclasses this to provide an alternate implementation, calling these methods would lead to RTE.\n{quote}\n\nYes, I agree that it is a very valid concern, as a runtime exception is a poor substitute for a compile-time error. I think a mitigating circumstance here is that these classes are normally extended only by the *canonical* implementation (protobuf impl): {{ContainerStatusPBImpl}} for {{ContainerStatus}}, and {{NodeReportPBImpl}} for {{NodeReport}}. Thus, the real likelihood that these classes would be extended by other classes would be pretty small, but it cannot be ruled out. In practice, the only times these are extended might be test classes (mock classes).\n\nIn that sense, actually it could be an argument *for* not moving this change to the trunk. By doing so, we would be extending this window of potential trouble into 3.0. Since 2.8 has not been released, we could consider this as adding compatible default implementation methods which will then be made abstract in 3.0. Thoughts?\n\n{quote}\nThe reason I am raising this concern is to see if there is a need for one more annotation that clarifies our intent about users extending classes to be plugged in.\n{quote}\n\nI do agree that we probably need another audience annotation for whether users may extend/implement classes (which I also proposed in the original email thread):\n{quote}\nIt could be feasible to have an interface as Public/Stable for users (anyone can use the API in a stable manner) but Private for implementers. The idea is that it is still a public interface but no third-party code should not subclass or implement it. I suspect a fair amount of hadoop's public interface might fall into that category. That itself is probably an incompatible change, so we might have to wait until after 3.0, however.\n{quote}\n\nOne practical difficulty I see is for test classes. One key need to extend/implement the interface is because users need to provide a mocked test class. If we declare these interfaces are off limits to implement/extend, then they would need to stick with pure mocking via mocking libraries. I'm not sure how onerous that requirement would be.\n\ncc [~stevel@apache.org] for his thoughts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-11-01T16:22:44.841+0000","updated":"2016-11-01T16:22:44.841+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12974281/comment/15637268","id":"15637268","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ping for more discussions on this.

That's created an obligation: don't break things wherever possible; this JIRA is essentially covering a situation where that wasn't quite met.\n\nNow people seem to be arguing the other way: if we add new methods, we don't want to provide default implementations, in case people don't implement them. Maybe —but the current policy implemented on these classes broke my mocking test code even though I wasn't using the new methods; again: a failure. To make things worse, I don't think I could even implement the new method in a class which could then be compiled against 2.7.x, as it's parameters were new datatypes.
