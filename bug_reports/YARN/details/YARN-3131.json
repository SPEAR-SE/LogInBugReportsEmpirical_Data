around to processing the submission request.  The concern is if the scheduler is running behind or takes a long time to process the submit request then we can starve the RM of IPC handler threads and end up blocking other clients.  That's why currently the YARN application submission process is a two-phase process, first submit then followed by a polling loop where the client checks if the app ended up in the right state.  If we want to make these potentially long-running calls synchronous then we should prioritize server-side asynchronous processing such as proposed by HADOOP-11552.\n\nYarnRunner \"works\" because it bothers to do one extra appreport after the app submission completes to verify the app is still in a non-failed/killed state.

The issue mainly stems from the fact that in Tez, we start an AM and then submit work to it directly.

Referring to my earlier comment, does it make more sense to do the simple checks inline instead of doing them as part of the app state machine?\n\nI believe the main issue is that when an app is submitted it must first persist the app to the state store which could take some time.  There was some concern originally that this would be too expensive to process inline.  This design came from YARN-549, maybe [~zjshen] has some additional input as to whether it would be reasonable to do more of the app submission processing inline.\n\nbq. We added a unit test for this and have seen it failing randomly on a minicluster as catching the failure on the first getAppReport() call is not reliable.\n\nAh, the state machine transitions for an app rejected by the scheduler look like this:\n\nNEW -> NEW_SAVING -> SUBMITTED -> FINAL_SAVING (still seen as SUBMITTED in an AppReport) -> FAILED\n\nSo if we look at the first app report that isn't NEW/NEW_SAVING we might still see SUBMITTED just before FAILED.  We'd have to also continue polling during the SUBMITTED state to verify it wasn't rejected.  When things are running normally the SUBMITTED state is usually very short-lived, which would explain the flaky test.\n\nbq. The issue mainly stems from the fact that in Tez, we start an AM and then submit work to it directly.\n\nSo is it important to know the AM is actually running?  An AM could take an indeterminate amount of time to eventually launch if submitted to a crowded queue, and the AM could fail to run in a number of ways before that (e.g.: killed by user, fail to launch due to JVM or container launch context issues, etc.).  Seems like there would need to be other failsafes in place besides just the fact that the scheduler accepted the job.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-17T21:15:08.498+0000","updated":"2015-02-17T21:15:08.498+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12772189/comment/14324980","id":"14324980","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

I do not think that continuously polling until RUNNING is a good idea. The most common case on a busy cluster is that an app can be submitted at time X but not start running until a long time later.\n\nThe patch does not cause the client to poll until the job is RUNNING.  It polls until the job has progressed past the SUBMITTED state.  The SUBMITTED state is a brief transient state before the ACCEPTED state.  So the client will wait approximately as long as it does today, and it fixes that flaky submit unit test in Tez.  It will not block until the AM is actually running.\n\nbq. As I mentioned earlier, I still believe that doing some basic checks in-line in ClientRMService itself and throwing an exception back straight away is probably a better idea than polling for any RUNNING/FAILED state. \n\nI agree that a blocking method is much easier on the client, but I don't think this is an easy change to make in the short term.  Again I think it requires a major change to the RPC layer and the RM to support server-side asynchronous call handling, otherwise we have to throw an army of threads at the client service to avoid blocking other clients and that has scaling issues.  We could probably add an API to the scheduler to do an in-line sanity check on the requested queue (which is a backwards-incompatible change for schedulers not in the Hadoop repo).  However there are many other things that could go wrong during submission that take a long time to perform, such as saving the application state and renewing delegation tokens.  I'm not sure it's a win if we check for one thing in-line that could go wrong but still have to poll for all the other things that could go wrong.  In the end, Tez and other YARN clients need to know if the app was accepted or not.  The queue being wrong is just one of the ways the submit could fail.\n\nContinuing to poll in the SUBMITTED state also meshes with the thoughts on the SUBMITTED state being something the client probably shouldn't see anyway.  See the discussion about NEW_SAVING and SUBMITTED in YARN-3230.\n\nThanks, Chang, for updating the patch.  Please investigate the unit test failure, as it looks like it could be related.  My only nit on the patch is it would be a bit clearer and more efficient if we used EnumSet constants to capture the set of states we're waiting the app to leave and the set of states that are failed-to-submit states.\n\nI suppose another way to solve this problem is to take the approach discussed in YARN-3230 and have the RM not expose the NEW_SAVING and SUBMITTED states to the client -- they would just see NEW.  We'd have to leave the states in the enumeration for backwards compatibility, but we'd stop exposing them in app reports.

We can just simply check for failToSubmitStates? Why do we also need to check for waitingStates?\n\nIf we only check for failToSubmitStates then we'll continue to loop waiting for those failed states.  We need to check for waitingStates because that's the typical looping condition.  We need to keep polling for a new application report as long as the app is in the NEW, NEW_SAVING, or SUBMITTED state since those states indicate the RM hasn't finished accepting the app yet.  When it's not in one of the waiting states, we need to check if its one of the failed states to decide to throw rather than just return indicating it was successful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-25T22:35:23.729+0000","updated":"2015-02-25T22:35:23.729+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12772189/comment/14337463","id":"14337463","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
