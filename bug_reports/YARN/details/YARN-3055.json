Most unfortunate.\n\nThe renewer looks like it may turn into a DOS weapon.  Renewing a token returns the next expiration.  The renewer uses a timer to renew 90% before expiration.  After the last renewal, the same expiration (\"the wall\") will be returned as before.  90% of \"the wall\" eventually becomes a rapid fire renewal.

Jason posted my patch we use internally on YARN-3439 which is duped to this jira.  I'm updating it to handle the proxy refresh cases and will post shortly.  The current semantics of the conf setting and the 2.x changes have been nothing but production blockers.

It's actually very desirable.  Years back, a job submitted with bad tokens - that was destined to fail - would be launched anyway.  The tasks failed to connect, ipc level retries occurred, then higher level retries occurred, and yarn generally caught all exceptions and retried.  Tasks were retried, perhaps the app attempt was retried, etc.  In the end, a job that _clearly was going to fail_ might tie up cluster resources for 20+ minutes.  Why was it launched when a failed renew could have prevented the problem?  Not to mention the renewer was hardcoded to assume the expiration interval was 24h...  So much for being able to stress test the renewer with <1m expirations.\n\nThe potential DOS problem is when a token has reached end of life expiration.  Let's say the token can be renewed twice.    The third and subsequent renews return the same expiration.\n# t1 = submit + renew\n# t2 = t1 + renew\n# t3 = t2\n# t4 = t2\n\nThe renew timers fire 90% of the delta between now and the next expiration.  So as end of life expiration approaches, the timer fires with an increasing frequency.  50 threads doing that virtually non-stop would not be pretty.  The solution is stop renewing when the next expiration equals the last expiration.  That can be addressed in another jira that's not a blocker because if tokens aren't renewed forever then it's a rare situation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-08T19:51:21.500+0000","updated":"2015-04-08T19:51:21.500+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12767062/comment/14485987","id":"14485987","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
