That concern definitely makes sense, and in general YARN-6163 seems like a good change.\n\nHowever, what I'm seeing is that only considering RRs for one node actually causes some of my apps to remain starved for quite a long time. The series of events that happens in a loop is:\n\n1. The app is correctly considered to be starved\n2. The app has many RRs, several of which can be satisfied, but only one RR is actually considered for preemption as per this JIRA's description\n3. That particular RR happens to be for a node on which no containers can be preempted for the app, so the app remains starved\n\nSince the order of the list of RRs is the same each time through the loop, the same RR is always considered, no containers are preempted, and the app remains starved, even though it has other RRs that could be satisfied.\n\nI haven't thought enough yet about what a solution would look like, but it seems like we should be able to keep the benefits of YARN-6163 while also avoiding this issue.

Is it reasonable to make sure to include at least one RR for which locality is relaxed, and/or the RR is for a rack or * in the list of RRs that we check, even if that means checking a lower-priority RR?\nThe relaxed locality versions should probably be considered based on delay scheduling configs. And, it is not clear whether to consider lower priority ones or not. Maybe, we can start with not considering and revisit based on how things fare in production.

All three of those suggestions make sense to me.\n\nI've attached a patch for considering a configurable number of RRs. It seems simplest to me to create separate JIRAs for prioritizing the RR(s) to check and honoring delay scheduling in preemption -- does that seem reasonable?\n\nEDIT: A couple of questions I had about the patch:\n\n* I don't have a good sense for how to pick the default number of RRs to look at, and the choice of 10 for {{MIN_RESOURCE_REQUESTS_FOR_PREEMPTION_DEFAULT}} was fairly arbitrary. Happy to change that to something more reasonable if someone else has better intuition there.\n* If adding a new configuration point as in the patch makes sense, where should I add docs for it? My guess is {{yarn-default.xml}}, but I wasn't completely sure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Steven+Rand","name":"Steven Rand","key":"steven rand","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steven Rand","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2017-08-13T20:26:15.018+0000","updated":"2017-08-13T20:30:30.019+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13092704/comment/16125051","id":"16125051","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue}  0m 21s{color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n|| || || || {color:brown} Prechecks {color} ||\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green}  0m  0s{color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 2 new or modified test files. {color} |\n|| || || || {color:brown} trunk Compile Tests {color} ||\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 15m 41s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green}  0m 41s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green}  0m 28s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green}  0m 40s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} findbugs {color} | {color:green}  1m  7s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green}  0m 26s{color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n|| || || || {color:brown} Patch Compile Tests {color} ||\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green}  0m 39s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green}  0m 36s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green}  0m 36s{color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:orange}-0{color} | {color:orange} checkstyle {color} | {color:orange}  0m 25s{color} | {color:orange} hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager: The patch generated 9 new + 98 unchanged -
