It's similar to the problem we saw in MAPREDUCE-6230 which is the same kind of AMRM token updating code, just in the MR-AM code rather than the AMRMClientImpl code.\n\n# The RM creates an AMRM token as part of setting up the AM's launch context.  That token is created with an empty service name, see AMRMSecretManager.createAndGetAMRMToken.\n# The RM then pokes this token into the launch context credentials, using the token's service name as the key.  See AMLauncher.setupTokens and Credentials.addToken.  We now have an AMRM token in the credentials mapped under an empty service name as the key.\n# When the AMRMClient receives an updated AMRM token it updates the service name of the token _before_ it pokes it into the credentials.  See AMRMClientImpl.updateAMRMToken.  Therefore we are adding the token using a non-empty service name as the key in the credentials token map.\n# After updating the credentials we now have _two_ AMRM tokens in the credentials map, one with an empty service name key (but a non-empty service name on the token itself) and one where the service name key equals the token's service name.  In other words, we failed to replace the existing AMRM token in the credentials\n\nAlso for a secure setup, we're updating the wrong UGI.  IIUC the ClientRMProxy will use the UGI obtained from the current user when performing the connection to the RM, so updating the login user rather than the current user can update the wrong UGI if we're currently running in a doAs context where the UGI isn't the login UGI.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-27T19:26:29.282+0000","updated":"2015-01-27T19:26:29.282+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770398/comment/14294032","id":"14294032","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"In general it seems very hazardous to assume nobody else will ever try to put a token into a credentials map associated with an empty service name.  It's just begging for two unrelated tokens to accidentally clobber each other.  IMHO the RM should add the AMRM token to the credentials using a well-known identifier that the client can also use when updating it.  For example, rather than the RM poking the token in with an empty service name, it could do something like this instead:\n\n{code}\n    // Add AMRMToken\n    Token<AMRMTokenIdentifier> amrmToken = createAndSetAMRMToken();\n    if (amrmToken != null) {\n      credentials.addToken(AMRMTokenIdentifier.KIND_NAME, amrmToken.getService(), amrmToken);\n    }\n{code}\n\nAnd clients could expect to associate any updated AMRM token from the RM in a similar fashion, poking it into the credentials using the KIND_NAME alias rather than relying on the implicit service name mapping done with UserGroupInformation.addToken(Token) form.   That way we're helping to isolate the token from other tokens.  The client would be free to update the service name of the token and know that when it pokes it back into the credentials it will be replacing the existing token.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-27T19:31:42.792+0000","updated":"2015-01-27T19:31:42.792+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770398/comment/14294201","id":"14294201","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"thanks for reporting this issue, Jason !\nIIUC, the root cause is that {{ClientRMProxy#setAMRMTokenService}} updates the service name of the token, but doesn't update the service key which is empty.

AFAIK there's no way to know what key/alias a given token is associated with in the credentials, which makes it particularly tricky to make sure we're updating the right one.  At least using a non-empty string will help us avoid colliding with other, non-AMRM tokens accidentally.  The only way I know to fix this the \"right\" way is if the RM knew, at the time of the AM launch context creation, what service name the AM would use to locate the RM.  It could then set the token service name properly before putting it in the credentials (and not require fixing up the service name by the client).

Jason, does the patch work on secure cluster too? \n\nI didn't test this particular patch on a secure cluster, however I did test the same kind of change in MAPREDUCE-6230 on a secure cluster.  That patch did not work if I let it update the login user instead of the current user.  The current user is what the RPC layer is going to use (indeed, most of the purpose doAs exists is to specify which UGI the RPC layer will use), so I have no idea why we would try to circumvent that and update some other UGI.\n\nbq. In MRAppMaster#initAndStartAppMaster, will it work if we insert the correct key/alias when adding credentials into appMasterUgi ?\n\nYes, I suppose there is one way to change what key/alias is associated with a token in Credentials and that's to create a complete copy of the credentials and specify the new alias when adding the token to the copy.  Since innitAndStartAppMaster is doing that, it could explicitly specify the key/alias by manually copying the credentials and special-casing the AMRM token.  Seems simpler to just re-use the alias set by the RM if that can work.  Or just add a UGI/Credentials API to update the service name of a token that also updates its key/alias in the credentials map so subsequent token stores will overwrite that token.  Or maybe a bit cleaner to have an API that explicitly says to replace one token with another, since the client can hunt down the old AMRM token using its updated service name.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-28T22:10:08.915+0000","updated":"2015-01-28T22:10:08.915+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770398/comment/14296003","id":"14296003","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
