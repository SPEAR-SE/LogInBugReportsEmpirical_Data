Couple of comments on the latest one (71-6.txt)\n\n- The ResourceLocalizationService is already creating a FileContxt instance - that can be used.\n- The rename/exception code is the same across the 3 top level dirs and can move into a function.\n- The patch needs some formatting fixes (missing spaces after \"+\", \",\" etc)\n- Haven't looked at the unit test yet, but I don't think it belongs in TestNodeStatusUpdater.\n\nIn terms of the approach of moving dirs and scheduling them for background deletion - this seems reasonable to me. Once concern I have though is that this could cause some load on the NMs after they're restarted (especially on systems with a large dist cache and disks). This effectively ends up affecting performance. Anyone else have thoughts on this ? Maybe background / inline deletion should be configurable ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-12T02:32:47.268+0000","updated":"2013-03-12T02:32:47.268+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543540/comment/13600584","id":"13600584","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"1.Reuse the FileContxt instance\n2.put rename/exception code into a new function.\n3.create new test java file , testNodeManagerReboot.java, and add new test case","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-12T22:48:52.900+0000","updated":"2013-03-12T22:48:52.900+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543540/comment/13600599","id":"13600599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
