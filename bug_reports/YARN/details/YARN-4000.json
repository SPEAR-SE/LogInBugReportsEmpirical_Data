indicate any error and instead posts an app rejected event back to the app.  However before that event can be processed the RMAppImpl recovery proceeds to recover RMAppAttemptImpl events.  When it tries to recover an app attempt the scheduler blindly assumes that an app attempt added event means there's a corresponding app.  In this case there is no app since it was earlier rejected, hence the NPE.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-07-30T22:32:21.906+0000","updated":"2015-07-30T22:32:21.906+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12850438/comment/14662861","id":"14662861","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~jlowe] / [~leftnoteasy], your thoughts on this ?\nNot let RM start in this case or just fail the app ?\n\nI think latter because configuration like this(adding leaf queues to an existing queue) is a valid and supported configuration in CS.

These can be accomplished by restarting the RM but at that point we're doing an unrelated queue setup and trying to avoid things that are \"hard\" to accomplish.  If they were easy, we'd just support them as refreshable options rather than requiring a restart.  Supporting these kinds of config changes during work-preserving RM restart essentially requires us to tackle them as if we were refreshing, because apps and containers aren't getting wiped off the cluster between the changes.  That means we need to hammer out exactly what the semantics are if we don't declare it to be outright wrong to set up the configs like that.\n\nKilling an app when its queue disappears, either by being deleted or by having it suddenly become a parent queue, is a bit severe, especially if it was an accident (e.g.: someone typo'd the queue name in the list of child queues when adding an unrelated queue).  However I'm not sure we have a lot of other great options.  We could move the application to another queue so it can survive, but then the question is what queue to use.  There may not be a default queue and/or the user may not have permissions on any other queue.  Or all other queues could already be at max app capacity, etc.\n\nAnother option is to put the app in limbo and \"pause\" it, where it won't get any more resources but we won't kill any outstanding containers.  Basically we're waiting for the user to move it themselves so it can progress.  But in the interim the accounting is messed up because cluster resources are being consumed by something that isn't in a queue.\n\nSo for now, killing it seems to be the path of least resistance if the RM has to survive.  Agree with Karthik that the fail-fast config seems appropriate for determining whether the user would like the RM to fail to come up with that config or kill apps to survive.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-08-10T14:43:02.394+0000","updated":"2015-08-10T14:43:02.394+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12850438/comment/14680408","id":"14680408","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 to what [~jlowe]'s suggestion, we should kill app (if rm.fail-fast is false) or fail RM (if rm.fail-fast is true).\n\nThis is similar to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3764, we need to consider LeafQueue's movement as well. \nCurrently RM restart will be succeeded (haven't verified, just my guess) if we move a leaf queue from one parent to another during restart.

Application is being killed by user right on RM restart. This is an existing problem though. Do you think so ?\nYou mean user killing the application and we killing the application too at the same time ? But RM will first do the recovery and then only open any of the ports while transitioning to active. So ClientRMService or ResourceTrackerService wont even start till recovery is done. So most probably by the time kill from user comes, all the recovery related events should be processed. Even if they are not processed, they will be ahead in the dispatcher queue. A KILL event if app is already KILLING would be ignored by RMAppImpl.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-09-22T20:36:32.732+0000","updated":"2015-09-22T20:36:32.732+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12850438/comment/14903400","id":"14903400","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq. Is this the case? I think in current code, RM is still ignoring these orphan containers?\nIn recoverContainersOnNode, if we do not find application in scheduler the flow in RM if I look at trunk code is as under:\n# AbstractYarnScheduler#killOrphanContainerOnNode will be called if application is not found in scheduler, which will in turn post CLEANUP_CONTAINER event (for containers which have not finished). This event will be handled by RMNodeImpl. Although here we will be sending one CLEANUP_CONTAINER event for each container even though all containers for a running app will have to be cleaned up. Maybe this can be refactored to send one event only with all the containers for an app and node. But cleaning up a lot of containers like this maybe a rare scenario.\n# Anyways going further, in RMNodeImpl, this event will be processed in CleanUpContainerTransition. Here the container will be added to a set containersToClean.\n# When heartbeat from NM comes, ResourceTrackerService#nodeHeartbeat will call RMNodeImpl#updateNodeHeartbeatResponseForCleanup. In this method, response will be populated with containers to cleanup from the set containersToClean. And hence these containers are reported back to NM in HB Rsp.\n\nOn NM side, flow is as under:\n# In NodeStatusUpdaterImpl, these containers to cleanup will be retrieved from HB Rsp and CMgrCompletedContainersEvent will be dispatched.\n# In ContainerManagerImpl, this event will be processed and a ContainerKillEvent created for each container. \n# Now depending on the state of the container, ContainerImpl will send a CLEANUP_CONTAINER event to ContainersLauncher which will then send a TERM/KILL signal to container.
