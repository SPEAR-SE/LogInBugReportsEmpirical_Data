IMHO, it's better to normalize the requested resource to the multiple of the min value, which is also not larger than max value. For example min = 1024, max = 2560, resource = 2300. If only min value is considered, the resource will be normalized to 3072. Then, if max value is considered, the resource should be reduce to the max multiple of min value, but no larger than max value, i.e., 2048.\n\nOtherwise, if the exception is anyway to be thrown in normalization, Client and ApplicationMaster of distributed shell should be modified accordingly, because the request resource are reset to the max value there if it is larger than the max value.

Modify the boundary case of judging valid resource value (\"< 0\" => \"<= 0\").\n\n2. maxMem doesn't need to be the multiple times of minMem.\n\n3. To fix YARN-382, in RMAppManager, AM CLC still need to be updated after request normalization is executed, such that AM CLC knows the updated resource if possible, which will be equal to the resource of the allocated container. To ensure the equivalence, assert is added in RMAppAttemptImpl$AMContainerAllocatedTransition. Changes in YARN-370 is also reverted.\n\nTherefore, if this jira is fixed, YARN-382 can be fixed as well.\n\n4. InvalidResourceException, which is extended from IOException, is created and used when the requested resource is invalid in terms of its numbers. Modify the related functions to either throw or capture the exceptions. In particular, in the transitions of RMAppAttemptImpl, when the exception is captured the attempt will transit to FAILED state.\n\nWhen YARN-142 gets fixed, the customized exception need to be updated.\n\n5.

AM container request should be validated and normalized in ApplicationMasterService.submitApplication() as the first thing, even before sending it to RMAppManager. Task container requests should be validated in ApplicationMasterService.allocate() as the first thing before calling scheduler.allocate(). This is like a sanity check. This also ensures that we are not calling into the scheduler and changing its internal state (eg it could return completed container or newly allocated container which would be lost if we throw an exception).\nRMAppAttempImpl could assert that the allocated container has same size as the requested container.\n\nNormalization should simply cap the resource to the max allowed. Normalize can be called from anywhere and so its not necessary to always validate before normalizing. In fact we could choose to normalize requests > max to max instead of throwing an exception.\n\nValidate should not throw an exception IMO. Its like a helper function that tell if the value is valid or not.

Was it supported earlier or does the patch introduce this support?\n{quote}\n\nYes, the patch introduces the support. It is already there in your previous patch. I inherit it and and some description in yarn-default.xml. I'm fine with whether the function need to be supported or not. One risk I can image if the function is supported is that AM memory can exceeds \"yarn.nodemanager.resource.memory-mb\" when DISABLE_RESOURCELIMIT_CHECK is set.

For example, RMAppAttemptImpl#ScheduleTransition#transition doesn't require to do normalization because the resource has been validated during the submission stage. For another example, RMAppAttemptImpl#AMContainerAllocatedTransition#transition supplies an empty ask. \n\n{quote}\nUnrelated to this patch but when throwing/logging errors related to configs, we should always point to the configuration property to let the user know which property needs to be changed.
