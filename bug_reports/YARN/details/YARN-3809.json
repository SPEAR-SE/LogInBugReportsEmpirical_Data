That is used by every client of the ContainerManagementProtocol, which includes AMs, etc.  AMLauncher.getContainerMgrProxy is a more appropriate place, although there we still don't want to create a new config every time we create an NM client proxy.  Creating configs is expensive.  An even better place to put this change is in the AMLauncher constructor, where it can create a copy of the conf then set the IPC config in it, which in turn will be passed to the YarnRPC code to create the proxy.\n\nThe new properties should have entries in yarn-default.xml for documentation purposes.\n\nNit: \"container-management\" is probably not going to be clear to most users what it means.  I think it would be clearer to use \"nodemanager\" since that's used in many other places, so I suggest a property name like \"yarn.resourcemanager.nodemanager-connect-retries\".\n\nSince we're changing the code that sets up the AM launcher thread pool, it'd be really nice to give each of the threads in that pool a descriptive name.
