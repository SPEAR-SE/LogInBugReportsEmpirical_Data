One can\nalso trigger this by \"errantly\" running the following in a tight loop:\ncurl -H \"Content-Type: application/json\" -X POST -d '{ \"renewer\" :\n\"hdfsdu\" }' -u : --negotiate\nhttp://f-bcpc-vm2.example.bloomberg.com:8088/ws/v1/cluster/delegation-token\n\nHowever, what I can't find is any limitation of the number of delegation\ntokens per user; nor can I find a way to see where the requests are coming\nfrom. (I.e. I would like if I could get the IP of clients requesting\ntokens; though the znodes do have the user to at least to track down the\nwho -- but not the where, often something one must do when a cluster user\nhas an errant job.)\n\nIn the shoes of YARN-2962, perhaps some remediation could be a namespace\nin ZK per user - so one can only denial-of-service themself, or YARN could\neven raise an exception if more tokens than some threshold are\noutstanding.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"YARN RM can be crashed requesting too many delegation tokens","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clayb","name":"clayb","key":"clayb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401"},"displayName":"Clay B.","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=clayb","name":"clayb","key":"clayb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=clayb&avatarId=22401"},"displayName":"Clay B.","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-7106/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3jba7:"}}
