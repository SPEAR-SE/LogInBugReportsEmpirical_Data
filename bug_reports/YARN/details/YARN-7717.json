I'm pretty confused on indentation rules in C code for hadoop. It appears that the code doesn't follow the same rules as Java hadoop code. In container-executor.c, a bunch of if statements have the following lines indented 4 spaces, while it's only 2 in docker-util.c. Looks like the culprit might just be inconsistency in container-executor.c not always following the same rules as Java hadoop code.
