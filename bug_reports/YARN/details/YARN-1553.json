We don’t want a user’s http request in a https setting to dictate this.\n - WebAppProxyServlet changes: What’s the use of AMUrlScheme? Just cache the conf and use WebappUtils.useHttps()?\n - TestRMWebServicesApps: Put some validation of the logsURL like before.\n\nWebappUtils\n - loadSslConfiguration(): Not using the passed in conf at all.\n - Add a bit of javadoc for this method\n\nYarnConfiguration:\n - Mark both the new keys that are added as @Private\n - Both RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP and RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTPS point to RM_WEBAPP_HTTPS_ADDRESS !\n - YARN_HTTP_POLICY_KEY: Fix formatting\n- getRMDefaultPortNumber() method should use the new method instead of using RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP directly.\n- Remove useHttps() method and only use WebappUtils.useHttps()?

In the few places that we used “//“, should we retain the old behavior and explicitly use the URL with scheme?\n\nThis is a general way of handling links for both http and https. Previously we've used your proposed scheme in the old HDFS UI, it was quite error-prone.\n\nbq. getRMDefaultPortNumber() method should use the new method instead of using RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP directly.\n\nIt is a static method so I don't quite see choosing between {{RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTP}} / {{RM_SERVICES_ADDRESS_CONF_KEYS_HTTPS}} are possible.
