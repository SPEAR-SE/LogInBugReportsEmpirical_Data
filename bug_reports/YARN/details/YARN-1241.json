Because this thread runs only every half second, app start can be delayed by up to a half second.  The changes required to make the property work for parent queues are a good opportunity for solving this problem as well.\n\nI propose splitting apps in leaf queues into runnable and non-runnable lists, and keeping a count of runnable apps in parent queues.  Determining an application's runnability at add-time will only require looking at the size of the runnable list of the leaf queue and the numRunnable in all the parent queues.\n\nThen, when an application is removed, we need to check to see whether any applications can now be made runnable.  We find the highest queue in the hierarchy that's a parent of the application's queue and that was previously at its maxRunningApps capacity.  We go through the apps in all leaf queues under that queue in order of start time to see if any can be made runnable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-26T17:00:51.112+0000","updated":"2013-09-26T17:00:51.112+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12670592/comment/13782276","id":"13782276","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Will post a rebased patch on latest trunk with your suggestions except where discussed below.\n\nbq. Should we make this a synchronized method along with other accessors of runnable and non-runnable appScheds? In case, we make the scheduler multi-threaded?\nI think you're right that this will ultimately need to be synchronized when we remove the super-coarse synchronization that we have currently. But, as a bunch of methods in similar situations currently aren't synchronized, I'd rather do it in a separate JIRA where we can take this on all at once.\n\nbq. Making a mental note. The assumption here is that we don't use demand to determine fairness between schedulables. Correct?\nCorrect\n\nbq. Should we even consider the demand for non-runnable schedulables?\nMy thinking I think it's more useful for a cluster operator to know about the total amount of resources demanded by all jobs submitted to the cluster.  E.g. someone might look at a queue's demand because they want to know whether anybody in it is waiting for anything, and leaving out the non-runnable apps would mask this from them.\n\nbq. MaxRunningAppsEnforcer should be singleton?\nAs there's only a single FairScheduler per RM, there will only end up being single instance. If for some reason we wanted to run multiple FairSchedulers in a process (for testing maybe), we would need a MaxRunningAppsEnforcer for each.\n\nbq. I am assuming the ListMultimap choice is to maintain the ordering and give preference to the earliest submitted job within a queue. Wondering if it would make sense to use any other metric than submit time for \"improved fairness\"?\nRight.  Definitely sounds conceivable to me that we might want to order them by something else in the future, but I don't we need to make the data structure more general until then.\n\nbq. IIUC, we are trying to check if the completing of this app makes any other applications runnable now? Shouldn't we break out of the loop as soon as we encounter a queue with zero non-runnable apps?\nYeah that's what we are trying to check.  childqueueX might have no pending apps itself, but if a queue higher up in the hierarchy parentqueueY has a maxRunningApps set, an app completion in childqueueX could allow an app in some other distant child of parentqueueY to become runnable.  I'll update the comment to try to explain a little more of what's being done.\n\nbq. Also, would be nice to have separate unit tests for MaxRunningAppsEnforcer.\nYou're right.  I will add a couple in.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-09T21:28:06.552+0000","updated":"2013-10-09T21:28:06.552+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12670592/comment/13791010","id":"13791010","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
