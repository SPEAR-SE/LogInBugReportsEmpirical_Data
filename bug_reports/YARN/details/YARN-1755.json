The web proxy is necessary for security reasons which are described on the Apache Hadoop website (http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/WebApplicationProxy.html).  The web application proxy is a part of YARN and can be configured to run as a standalone proxy. Currently, the RM itself supports web services. Adding support for all the web service calls in the web app proxy allows it to support failover and retry for all web services. The changes involved are the following â€“\na.\tAdd support for web service calls to the RM web application proxy and have it make the equivalent RPC calls.\nb.\tAdd support for failover and retry to the web application proxy. We can refactor a lot of the existing client code from the Yarn client.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"375756","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Add support for web services to the WebApp proxy","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12696985/comment/14524224","id":"14524224","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~vvasudev], do we still want to do this ? otherwise, we can close it out ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-01T22:55:24.287+0000","updated":"2015-05-01T22:55:24.287+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12696985/comment/14528769","id":"14528769","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Closing as won't fix - standby RM's redirect clients to the active RM removing the need for this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-05-05T16:40:20.528+0000","updated":"2015-05-05T16:40:20.528+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-1755/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1sp7z:"}}
