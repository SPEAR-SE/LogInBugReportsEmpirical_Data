I think we should use \"hadoop.proxyusers\" instead of introducing \"yarn.resourcemanager.proxyusers\".\n\nKMS and HTTPFS are using this feature as well, but using their individual prefix before \"proxyusers\". I think it makes sense because each component can edit its own proxyusers. In particular, it's desired in single-node cluster. Thinking about the property name again, should we use \"yarn.resourcemanager.webapp\" to be consistent with the existing YARN config names?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-10-10T17:09:29.810+0000","updated":"2014-10-10T17:09:29.810+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12746635/comment/14167137","id":"14167137","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks for pointing out the KMS and HTTPFS examples.
