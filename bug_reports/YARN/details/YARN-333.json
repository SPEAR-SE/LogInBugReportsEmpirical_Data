For example, your jobconf states 'default' as queue, and the fair-scheduler converts the queue to the user primary group\n*2 For a running job, via the fair-scheduler UI, it is possible to change the queue of the job (enforcing queue ACLs)\n\nWhile there are a few minor quirks (the JobInProgress does not get update to the right queeu), this works fine and you can see the new queue in most of the UI (scheduler owns most of the UI that shows queues).\n\nIn Hadoop 2, using fair-scheduler:\n\n*1, this is still doable but all the feedback to the user is provided by the RM which does not know about the queue name change. Thus there is a split-brain perception and it can lead to wrong decisions by admin trying to troubleshoot cluster utilization\n\n*2, this is not currently possible\n\n\nI see 2 ways to go about:\n\n*A make the necessary changes for the fair-scheduler to be able to provide #1 and #2 as a fair-scheduler only solution\n\n*B make the necessary changes so all schedulers support this capability\n\nTo do #A, the fair-scheduler should be able, via the RMContext, change the queue of job in the RM. This would take care of #1 and #2. Still it is the responsibility of the fair-scheduler to provide an end-point to the user/admin to perfom #2.\n\nTo do #B, the ClientRMProtocol would have a new 'changeQueue(String queueName)' method, the YarnScheduler would have a new 'String getActualQueue(String queueName)' method. On job submission the RM would call the scheduler 'getActualQueue()' method to resolve the actual queue for the job (this takes care of #1). On a 'changeQueue()' call, the RM also calls the scheduler 'getActualQueue()'.\n\nNote that on both approaches, the scheduler is still responsible for enforcing queue ACLs as it is done today.\n\nThe benefit I see in #B, is that will be consistent for the different scheduler implementations. It will also leverage the existing client RPC, so no need to worry about a different endpoint and the security considerations this means.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-04-18T20:01:45.376+0000","updated":"2013-04-18T20:01:45.376+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626907/comment/13635837","id":"13635837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"In case is not clear, I favor #B","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-04-18T23:35:46.428+0000","updated":"2013-04-18T23:35:46.428+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12626907/comment/13682909","id":"13682909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Uploading a patch that adds a setQueue method to RMApp, allowing a scheduler to change the name of an application.
