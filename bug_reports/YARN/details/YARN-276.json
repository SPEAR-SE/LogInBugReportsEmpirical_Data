See the formular bellow.\n\n1. clusterResource * maximumApplicationMasterResourcePercent = minAllocation * maxActiveApplications.\n\nmaxActiveApplications is computed by assuming each application only requires minAllocation. In fact, AM container may require more. Therefore,\n\n2. clusterResource * maximumApplicationMasterResourcePercent = minAllocation * maxActiveApplications = (minAllocation_1 + minAllocation_2 + ... + minAllocation_k) <= (requestedResource_1 + requestedResource_2 + ... + minAllocation_k), where k = maxActiveApplications.\n\nHence when maxActiveApplications applications are activated and they require more than minAllocation resource, such that more than maximumApplicationMasterResourcePercent of clusterResource may be used by AMs, and even clusterResource is likely to be exceeded.\n\n@nemon's solution looks good, which is actually a more restrict bound of the max allowed active applications. Whenever an application is to be activated, the following criteria is checked.\n\n3. clusterResource * maximumApplicationMasterResourcePercent - ApplicationMasterResource >= requestedResource.\n\nThe issue here is that when this criteria is met, maxActiveApplications should be met as well, because this one is more restricted.

The main reason being its useful to show to users so that they know what limit they might be hitting.  Otherwise their job could be waiting to activate and the UI doesn't show them any limits they might be hitting.  The overAMUsedPercentPerUser should use the Capacity not maxCapacity.  \n\nThe per user checks need to taking into account the minimum user percent as well as the user limit factor (like it did in previous version of the patch). Ideally this is dynamically figured out instead of it being hardcoded like before since you could have a user limit % at like 20%, but if there is only 2 users each user really gets 50%.  That could be complicated based on the timing of things. The downside to the dynamic is that it makes it much harder for users to understand why there job might not be launched.   It might make more sense to keep the formula similar to before where it uses both user limit factor and user limit percent for now and file a separate jira to investigate making that more dynamic.  That jira could also look into addressing the amresource percent applying to the absolute max capacity.  \n\n- can you update the web services documentation (./hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/ResourceManagerRest.apt.vm)\n\n- we can remove the \"Per Queue\" from the web ui: Max AM Resource Per Queue Percent. I think we can remove the \"PerQueue\" bit from the REST web services too: maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent -> maxAMResourcePercent\n\n- we are keeping the AM used resource percent at the user level.  It might be nice to print output this atleast through the REST webservices. It would be nice to have in the UI too but I'm a bit afraid its going to get to cluttered there. \n\n- the REST webservices print out of the amUsedResources should be of type ResourceInfo so that you get it in separated fields like:\n<amResourcesUsed>\n<memory>4096</memory>\n<vCores>2</vCores>\n</amResourcesUsed>\n\nThe old format that we kept for backwards compatibility was: <usedResources><memory:4096, vCores:2></usedResources>. We don't need that format since this is new.\n\n\n- TestApplicationLimits - remove the old comment -      // set max active to 2\n- TestApplicationLimits - why are you multiplying by the userLimitFactor?\n+    Resource queueResource = Resources.multiply(clusterResources,\n+        queue.getAbsoluteCapacity() * queue.getUserLimitFactor());\n\n- what are the changes in TestClientTokens.java?\n\n- In the MiniYarnCluster why are we setting the AM resource percent to 100%?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-06T21:38:08.929+0000","updated":"2013-06-06T21:38:08.929+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624401/comment/13683151","id":"13683151","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nemon","name":"nemon","key":"nemon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931"},"displayName":"Nemon Lou","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Many test cases(both in YARN and MapReduce project) will fail because we have a more stringent AM used resource percent limit than before .These test cases fail to obtain an AM container.That's why i set the AM resource percent to 100% for both MiniYarnCluster and MockRM. May be i should change these failed test cases but there will be a lot of work to do.Or we can change default value in capacity-scheduler.xml both in  project hadoop-yarn-server-tests and hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager.
