Templeton","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the patch, [~pvillard].  Unfortunately, the {{getGroups()}} method makes no distinction between a user with no groups and a failure retrieving a user from the cache.  I think the cheapest way to deal with that is to add a log message that explain why the group mapping is not being applied.  Seems like it should be warn or info, probably warn.  It's a scenario that's undesirable and should be addressed no matter which reason it fails.  The better solution would be to update the API to throw different exceptions, but that could be a pretty big change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=templedf","name":"templedf","key":"templedf","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=templedf&avatarId=24879"},"displayName":"Daniel Templeton","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-02T00:26:38.049+0000","updated":"2017-03-02T00:26:38.049+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13047490/comment/15891737","id":"15891737","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pvillard","name":"pvillard","key":"pvillard","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=pvillard&avatarId=32654","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=pvillard&avatarId=32654","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=pvillard&avatarId=32654","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=pvillard&avatarId=32654"},"displayName":"Pierre Villard","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Yeah agreed [~templedf].
