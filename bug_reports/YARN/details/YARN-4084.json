The problem comes when I use -Dmaven.test.skip=true which restricts the test code compilation. For this comment sake let me allow to tell that maven.test.skip option skip both the test code compilation and test case execution whereas skipTests skips only execution (not compilation).\n\nThis may sound unethical to compile source code without compiling test source code and in-fact for open source community this may never be a scenario. But I ran into one requirement wherein my Continuous Integration environment, I have to make a complete build as fast as possible where every minute counts. In such a case disabling the test code compilation saves close to 3 to 4 minutes.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vpp9380","name":"vpp9380","key":"vpp9380","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541"},"displayName":"Ved Prakash Pandey","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-08-26T18:34:24.704+0000","updated":"2015-08-26T18:34:24.704+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12858873/comment/14715338","id":"14715338","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vpp9380","name":"vpp9380","key":"vpp9380","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=vpp9380&avatarId=22541"},"displayName":"Ved Prakash Pandey","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I realize that my patch enforces to use the {{-Penable-yarn-server-test-module}} option to have normal builds.
