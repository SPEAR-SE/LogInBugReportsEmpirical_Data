Thanks a lot for your prompt reply. :) 20000 jobs on the JHS resulted in a ~13 Mb file. (I can see that there's a lot of whitespace in the file, which we can probably get rid of). Anyway, I timed how much time it takes for the browser to download and render this on my machine. It took about 35 seconds. When I rendered the locally saved file, it took 11 seconds. Here's an HTML file containing a table with 20000 rows. It again took 12 seconds. \n\nIt seems to me that the majority of the time (35-12) was taken in downloading the file. I don't know why it would take so long, but it did :(\n\nI'll try to do some more tests with DataTables with deferred rendering. If that is fast, I would like it too, so that I can graph that data in MAPREDUCE-4747.
