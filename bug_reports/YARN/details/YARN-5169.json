I noticed that in RM's SystemMetricsPublisher code, we're creating {{SystemMetricEvent}} s which will always have timestamps. Those timestamps are typically generated by the call-sites of each system metrics publisher call. For example, in {{appACLsUpdated}} call, the update time is generated in RMAppManager#createAndPopulateNewRMApp. Similarly, appFinished method of SMP is called in RMAppImpl, when we perform the final state transition to final state. We also generate the finish time at that time. Maybe we'd like to provide a similar mechanism in the NM? That is to say, we can have NMMetricsEvent exposed in NM's source code, and create those events when we publish the data (instead of using timestamps of existing events)? I think we may put part of this work in trunk, but one concern is the newly introduced NMMetricsEvent will not be used in trunk but just in YARN-2928 branch...
