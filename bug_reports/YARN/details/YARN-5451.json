The localization service starts a localizer then expects that localizer to phone in via heartbeats to control it.  It doesn't track the pid or any other way to normally control it.  The problem with using a timeout interval at the Shell level is that it puts a hard limit on how long to localize something, and there may be cases where we want to keep localizing because good progress is being made (e.g.: large docker container download).  The other issue is that during NM restarts we no longer have a Shell instance associated with those processes since they are no longer children of the new NM process.\n\nIMHO the clear indication something is amiss is that startLocalizer returns void.  There's no pid or cookie of some kind to associate with the localizer instance.  It's fire-and-forget.  Once we start the localizer we can't stop it without it voluntarily heartbeating, and if the localizer goes rogue and refuses to heartbeat or respond properly to heartbeat commands the NM can't force it to stop like it can with normal containers.  The localizer should be tracked like containers are tracked so we can control them like we can control containers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-08-03T14:37:52.414+0000","updated":"2016-08-03T14:37:52.414+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12993647/comment/15406159","id":"15406159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vvasudev","name":"vvasudev","key":"vvasudev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Vasudev","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.
