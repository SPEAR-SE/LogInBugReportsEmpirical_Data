RM-NM already sync on running application state. This payload could piggyback on that.\n3) A container on an NM could query the NM about its own AM's payload. This local API could be secured by a local token and available to only containers running on the local node.\n4) This payload would be used by the containers to reconnect with the AM (in case systems dont use external solutions like zookeeper for such tracking.\n\nThis sounds reasonably light-weight, scalable and self-contained. All the interested parties would be informed within 2*(NmHeartbeat) time interval.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-11T22:15:47.055+0000","updated":"2014-01-11T22:15:47.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12683932/comment/13993962","id":"13993962","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Created a couple of sub-tasks based on an offline discussion with Anubhav, Bikas, Jian and Vinod.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-09T21:51:52.127+0000","updated":"2014-05-09T21:51:52.127+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12683932/comment/15096860","id":"15096860","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Hi [~vinodkv], [~jianhe] and [~kasha@cloudera.com], is this feature already completed?
