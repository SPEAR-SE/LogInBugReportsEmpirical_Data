Can you take a look at the updated patch. \n\nLooked into this more carefully. Updated patch changes both ClientRMService and ApplicationMasterService. I believe we have three cases based on the state and kind of application.\n* Applications that have already reached a final state - do nothing, trivially log success.\n* Applications that aren't in a final state yet - kill / unregister the application\n** UnmanagedAM - falsely acknowledge kill/ unregister so they don't retry\n** ManagedAM - return false, so they keep retrying\n\nSubmitted the patch to see what Jenkins has to say. Still need to add unit tests.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-07T05:07:09.160+0000","updated":"2014-03-07T05:07:09.160+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699253/comment/13923591","id":"13923591","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
