The first job controlled the cancellation of the token.\nCorrect.\n\nbq. This prevented completion of sub-jobs from canceling tokens used by the main job.\nOnly, partially true. More common case to avoid was the completion of the launcher job itself canceling tokens to be used by the sub-jobs.\n\nbq. As of YARN-2704, the RM now tracks tokens on a per-app basis. There is no notion of the first/main job. This results in sub-jobs canceling tokens and failing the main job and other sub-jobs.\nAFAIR, this code never had the concept of a first job. An app submits tokens, there was a flat list of tokens, everytime an app finishes, RM will check if the CancelTokensWhenComplete flag is set, and ignore the cancelation of this app if the flag is set.

AFAIR, this code never had the concept of a first job.

Or we can take another solution to have an application group Id to indicate a group of applications like oozie case and tie the token lifetime with the group, and drop this flag completely. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-18T01:29:44.201+0000","updated":"2014-12-18T01:29:44.201+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761893/comment/14250968","id":"14250968","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 to the idea of groups.  canceling/not canceling the token the way we do now seems kinda hacky.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-18T01:35:51.736+0000","updated":"2014-12-18T01:35:51.736+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761893/comment/14251013","id":"14251013","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"uploaded a patch:\n- the patch adds a new map which keeps track of all the tokens.

Findbug warnings appear to be unrelated.\n\nI'm wondering about the change in the removeApplicationFromRenewal method or remove.  If a sub-job completes, won't we remove the token from the allTokens map before the launcher job has completed?  Then a subsequent sub-job that requests token cancelation can put the token back in the map and cause the token to be canceled when it leaves.  I think we need to repeat the logic from the original code before YARN-2704 here, i.e.: only remove the token if the application ID matches.  That way the launcher job's token will remain _the_ token in that collection until the launcher job completes.\n\nThis comment doesn't match the code, since the code looks like if any token wants to cancel at the end then we will cancel at the end.\n{code}\n          // If any of the jobs sharing the same token set shouldCancelAtEnd\n          // to true, we should not cancel the token.\n          if (evt.shouldCancelAtEnd) {\n            dttr.shouldCancelAtEnd = evt.shouldCancelAtEnd;\n          }\n{code}\nI think the logic and comment should be if any job doesn't want to cancel then we won't cancel.  The code seems to be trying to do the opposite, so I'm not sure how the unit test is passing.  Maybe I'm missing something.\n\nThe info log message added in handleAppSubmitEvent also is misleading, as it says we are setting shouldCancelAtEnd to whatever the event said, when in reality we only set it sometimes.  Probably needs to be inside the conditional.\n\nWonder if we should be using a Set instead of a Map to track these tokens.  Adding an already existing DelegationTokenToRenew in a set will not change the one already there, but with the map a sub-job can clobber the DelegationTokenToRenew that's already there with its own when it does the allTokens.put(dtr.token, dtr).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-12-18T15:42:24.899+0000","updated":"2014-12-18T15:42:24.899+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761893/comment/14252045","id":"14252045","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"thanks for your comments, Jason !\n\nbq. I'm wondering about the change in the removeApplicationFromRenewal method or remove.\nIf launcher job first gets added to the appTokens map, DelegationTokenRenewer will not add DelegationTokenToRenew instance for the sub-job. So the tokens in removeApplicationFromRenewal will return empty for the sub-job when the sub-job completes. So the token won’t be removed from the allTokens. My only concern with a global set that is that each time an application completes, we end up looping all the applications or worse (each app may have at least one token).\nbq.

RM is the designated renewer so it should renew the token every so often. But because there's a bug in DelegationTokenRenewer, RM just forgets the token and won't renew the token automatically. So we should fix this in DelegationTokenRenewer to keep track of the token and renew the token properly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-19T22:06:42.722+0000","updated":"2014-12-19T22:06:42.722+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761893/comment/14275183","id":"14275183","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"It seems this JIRA will cause the token is not renewed properly if it's shared by jobs (oozie), I filed a JIRA YARN-3055, please take a look.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitliuyi","name":"hitliuyi","key":"hitliuyi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-01-13T13:32:19.274+0000","updated":"2015-01-13T13:32:19.274+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12761893/comment/14721909","id":"14721909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Pulled this into 2.6.1.
