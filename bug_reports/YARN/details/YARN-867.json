and inform the AM. \n\nHere is how it works:\n\nWe will use containerManagementProtocol. Basically, AM will need to send the AuxiliaryServiceCheckRequest with ApplicationId as parameter frequently (We can set the period as 3s or 5s), and we use ContainerManagementProtocol to send this request to all the ContainerManager that this AM knows. Then those ContainerManagers will send the response back with the information whether there is any AuxiliaryService with this appId is failed, and related diagnositics. \n\nAt ContainerManagerImpl side, for all the registered  AuxServices, if any of them fails, instead of simp lying throwing out of the exceptions to the dispatcher, we will catch the exceptions, and save them with appId and exception message into a AuxServiceFailureMap. In that case, when one containerManager receives  AuxiliaryServiceCheckRequest, it can check AuxServiceFailureMap with the appId, and send back the response with whether this is any  AuxServices with this appid fails.\n\nAttached a sample code for this proposal.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-14T18:27:38.462+0000","updated":"2013-08-14T18:27:38.462+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13740042","id":"13740042","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Might be good to break this down in a subset of jiras.

And for informing the AM, instead of adding more protocol changes, we can fail the container setting a proper diagnostic and may be a custom exit-code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-15T02:47:03.876+0000","updated":"2013-08-15T02:47:03.876+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13745794","id":"13745794","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.Let's just handle the NM crash scenario here.

I think that we can use a easier way to solve this issue. This is the proposal :\nIf auxServices throw out the exceptions, we still need to catch them, after that, we can fail the related container by send the containerExitEvent with ContainerEventType.CONTAINER_EXITED_WITH_FAILURE. Also we need to provide the proper diagnostic and custom exit-code. Eventually, this container will transfer to Completed state. Then we can inform the RM thru the node heartbeat. In that case, the related RMContainer will get this diagnostic info and custom exit-code, also will go to completed state. So, when AM do the heartbeat, it will the list of completed containerStatus. After that, AM just need simply check the exit code to find out whether there is any auxService fail.\n\nAttached is the sample code for this propsal","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-21T05:37:01.839+0000","updated":"2013-08-21T05:37:01.839+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13746503","id":"13746503","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~vinodkv] Are we making the call that an issue in service handling is considered a container failure?

This patch still handles the AuxServicesEventType.APPLICATION_INIT and handles exceptions at the container level. \n\nI thought about moving AuxServicesEventType.APPLICATION_INIT into application. But I do not think that we will get any benefits. The reasons are :\n1. There are two newly events : AuxServicesEvent.CONTAINER_INIT and AuxServicesEvent.CONTAINER_STOP. We need to handle them at container level.\n2. Even if we move AuxServicesEventType.APPLICATION_INIT into application, we will have two options :\n   a. We will not start any containers until all the AuxServices finish their APPLICATION_INIT. If we choose this, that definitely simplify the problem. When there is any exceptions from APPLICATION_INIT on AuxServices, just simply kill the applications. But does it make sense that we need to block all the containers ?\n   b. We can let AuxServices do APPLICATION_INIT and container starts at the same time, if this is the case, we will go to the same process as now. Because, when the container receives the CONTAINER_EXITED_WITH_FAILURE event, we can not guarantee which state the container is, maybe at killing state, LOCALIZED state, etc. Any state is possible.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-12T17:52:22.648+0000","updated":"2013-09-12T17:52:22.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13765730","id":"13765730","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

And, do not fail the container if an exception is thrown. \n   - A simpler check could be done to match the service metadata from the ContainerLaunchContext and ensure that the service is configured on the NM in question. \n\nUsing the above, at the very least, we can catch issues related to mis-configured NMs where the shuffle service is not configured. This is way simpler as it could be done a simple synchronous check when handling the startContainers rpc call. This could be targeted to 2.1.2/2.2.0\n\nAs for the failing containers, I propose that we target fixing the feedback of failed containers back to the AM on service handling errors in 2.3.0. For the 2.3.0 targeted jira, I would prefer to increase the scope of this to design for differentiating critical vs non-critical services so as to have the framework in place to understand which service's errors result in failed containers. \n\nComments? \n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-03T16:07:01.767+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T16:07:01.767+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13785338","id":"13785338","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Simply logging and taking no action for catch Throwable whenever an aux service is invoked for handling the container related events ( app init, container start, container stop, app cleanup )","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xgong","name":"xgong","key":"xgong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Xuan Gong","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-10-03T16:54:15.895+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T16:54:15.895+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13785364","id":"13785364","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"the try/catch should be around each aux service method invocation so a failure of a given service does not affect delivery to other services.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-10-03T17:14:00.946+0000","updated":"2013-10-03T17:14:00.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12654046/comment/13785371","id":"13785371","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
