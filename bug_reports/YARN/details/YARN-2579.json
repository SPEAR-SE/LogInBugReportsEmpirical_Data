I am assuming we want to keep the changes to a minimum in this patch, and do a follow-up JIRA to clean this up better. I would love to work on the follow-up; noticed a few discrepancies while working on YARN-2010, that continue to exist with this patch as well. \n\nFunctionally, the patch looks good to me. In the interest of unblocking 2.6, I am +1 to committing it as well, but would like to point out some follow-up work that I see. Filed YARN-2814 to work on these items.\n\nI see the following follow-up items to simplify the surrounding code and improve readability, if we do commit the existing patch.\n# Get rid of RMFatalEventDispatcher and RMFatalEvent* altogether.\n# Given all other events are specific to RMActiveServices, we should move the dipatcher also into RMActiveServices.\n# I am not a fan of having a pointer to the RM in the store as well, particularly since we have RMContext primarily to hold the information other classes need. I am concerned about more classes needing this information in the future. \n# Add a shutdownOrTransitionToStandby method in the RM to transparently handle non-HA and HA cases.\n# Unrelated to this patch: we should make the existing {{transitionToStandby(boolean)}} private, and add a package-private {{transitionToStandby()}} to be called from AdminService and EmbeddedElectorService. \n# Instead of calling ExitUtil#terminate at multiple places in the RM, we should have a {{protected shutdown()}} method that does this and can be overridden in MockRM for better testing.
