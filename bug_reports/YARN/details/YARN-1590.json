Couple of questions:\n\nbq. It is true mainly for RM, NM, WebProxy, and JHS rpc service. Looks like it is working fine for webservice authentication.\nI didn't understand what you meant by it is working for webservice? Which webservices? RM? And you meant SPNEGO auth?\n\nI've checked HDFS and we aren't doing it for DataNodes. I can see why - usually you won't setup VIP for the slaves. Is that correct? If so, shall we also follow the same here for NodeManagers?\n\nBefore YARN-1505, we (mistakenly) had localhost:9099 as the address for the proxy-server. Being a central service, it makes sense for the web-app proxy to have a named port, so set the default to 9099?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-04T04:44:29.184+0000","updated":"2014-02-04T04:44:29.184+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688356/comment/13891062","id":"13891062","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"New patch that addressed Vinod's comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-02-04T19:28:07.116+0000","updated":"2014-02-04T19:28:07.116+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688356/comment/13891065","id":"13891065","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
