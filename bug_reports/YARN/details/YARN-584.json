Steps taken to manually verify patch\n       1. Tested the patch on my machine with queues and sub queues \n        example : \n        a. root -> [root.queue1 and root.queue2]\n        b. root->[ root.queue1->[root.queue1.queuea , root.queue1.queueb] and root.queue2]\n\n       Test Cases\n        i. First time page is loading properly : success.\n        ii. Open (Expand) a queue and reload the page , the queue that was opened earlier should be open after page is reloaded : success.\n        iii. Expand (Open) and Unexpand (Close) few queue's and reload the page again, the queue which were unexpanded before page reload should be unexpanded even after reload and the one which were in expanded state should be in expanded state ie. page should look the same even after reload with respect to queues open/close state. : success.\n\n        Tested in chrome (version 30.0.1599.101), Safari(Version 6.1 (7537.71)) and Firefox(version 20.0)\n        System : Mac OS X (version 10.7.5)\n\n3.
