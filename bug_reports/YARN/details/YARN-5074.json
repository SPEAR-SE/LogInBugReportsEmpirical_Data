App2 can get a container-id with number > 1.\n\nFrom what I can see, there're two issues that container id could be skipped when works with reservation-continuous-looking:\n\n*Issue#1, multiple containerId will be skipped*\nIn LeafQueue#assignContainer \n{code}\n    // Create the container if necessary\n    Container container = \n        getContainer(rmContainer, application, node, capability, priority);\n{code}\n\nHappens before successfully allocate or reserve container.\n\nSo if LeafQueue relaxed checks considered reserved resource, it is possible that unnecessary getContainer call happens.\n\nThis issue only exists in branch-2.7. Branch-2.8/branch-2/trunk will not create containerId unless it allocate or reserve new container.\n\n*Issue#2, single container id will be skipped:*\nThis issue exists in both of branch-2.7 and branch-2.8+.\n\nWhen one container (c1) is reserved at host1, and later it is cancelled to allocate another container (c2) at a different host, containerId of c1 will be skipped.\n\nUploading a demo test to reproduce this issue in branch-2.7:","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-11T23:53:53.105+0000","updated":"2016-05-11T23:53:53.105+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12968073/comment/15281019","id":"15281019","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"CC: [~jlowe]/[~nroberts]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-05-11T23:55:45.937+0000","updated":"2016-05-11T23:55:45.937+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-5074/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2xoq7:"}}
