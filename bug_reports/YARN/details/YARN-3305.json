As indicated in YARN-3305, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3996 is trying to fix the problem. YARN-3996 is currently work-in-progress, but we need to back port some of it immediately to unblock Myriad. Once YARN-3996 is fully fixed, it needs to be fully back ported. I've requested Sarjeet to raise two bugs for this (one to provide an immediate fix and second to back port YARN-3996 once it's resolved).\n    \n    Currently, the latest Myriad builds are effected by this change. The problem is that, the AM container resources are normalized during app submission with ```scheduler.getminimumResourceCapability()```, which comes from yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-{mb,vcores,disks}. These values are set to \"0\" by Myriad. Hence, the AM container allocated will be of zero size and is killed by NM as soon as it is launched.\n    \n    The reason why Myriad needs yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-{mb,vcores,disks} to be 0 is for discussed in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MYRIAD-139.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-12-08T00:17:25.485+0000","updated":"2015-12-08T00:17:25.485+0000"}],"maxResults":27,"total":27,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-3305/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i26i6n:"}}
