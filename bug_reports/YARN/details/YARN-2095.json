Would you agree that there should be a log entry from Yarn in this case?\n\nClay,\n\nWhat I noticed is that your reducers were overloaded and were on the brink of running out of memory. The Java heaps were running at 99% and continuously GC’ing while the app was reading from disk. So it was trying it’s best to process the job with limited resources. I agree with you that it would be helpful if the container could put out a log message that there was GC issues to help with debugging.\n\nThanks,","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-23T22:17:02.610+0000","updated":"2014-05-23T23:13:30.755+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-2095/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1vwev:"}}
