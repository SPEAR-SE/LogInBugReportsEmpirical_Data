That's utilizing an existing interface rather than adding a new one.  It's confusing to have two get state methods (current vs. container, but it _is_ a container so...), although I realize it derives from the undesirable situation of having two ContainerState types.  I suppose we could also just expose an isComplete() predicate method since callers are only checking for COMPLETE.\n\nThat being said I'm not totally against adding the yarn.api.records state in a new method, just think it's not really necessary.  If we continue along that route then ContainerImpl.getCurrentState needs the Override decorator.  Also ContainerImpl is now an usused import, and should continue to be unnecessary regardless of which route we pursue.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-11-07T19:30:13.181+0000","updated":"2014-11-07T19:30:13.181+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753577/comment/14202530","id":"14202530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. what's the reasoning to avoid checking for the DONE state?\nThe only reason is to consistent with the check in {{NodeStatusUpdaterImpl#getContainerStatuses}} where it's checking ContainerState.COMPLETE rather than DONE. i can just change it check DONE instead of adding a new method. updating the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-07T19:40:00.030+0000","updated":"2014-11-07T19:40:00.030+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12753577/comment/14202578","id":"14202578","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
