We could have done it at a per-user level.  copying comments from vinod in YARN-5098:\nbq. Overall, I think we can simplify this code if we simply always manage our own tokens for localization and log-aggregation for long-running applications / services. Today, it's too complicated: for the first day, we use the user's token T, second day we get a new token T' but share it for all the apps originally sharing T, after RM restart we use a new token T'' which is different for each of the apps originally sharing T.
