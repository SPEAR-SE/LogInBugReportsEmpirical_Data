This triggers localization per app in the node just once and using a local file I don't incur into any unnecessary extra latency with HDFS.\n\n* Possible solution 1: trigger resource localization always to force the LCE localization and ensure creation of the usercache/USER even if there are not application/private resources to localize.\n\n* Possible solution 2: the LCE launcher should call mkdirat at usercache/USER and do the chmod before launching the container process, if the dir already exists because of localization this is a NOP. the mkdirat happens before doing the setuid to launch the container process.\n\nI prefer option 2 because it will avoid triggering the localization thread and it will avoid adding extra latency to containers without localization.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-10-05T03:07:59.172+0000","updated":"2013-10-05T03:07:59.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672438/comment/13786909","id":"13786909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"We ran into this with distributed shell itself.
