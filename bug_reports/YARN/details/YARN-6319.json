While I agree with you that post-callback can completely avoid race condition, linearizing container cleanup and app cleanup will unnecessarily slow down the application state transition process which other tasks, such as log aggregation, depend on. Especially when you have a lot of containers for a given application, previously the app dir cleanup task can be running concurrently with all container cleanup tasks, now it will need to wait for all container cleanup tasks to finish. The point I wan to make is that the race condition is safe to have as long as we ignore the fileNotException error during deletion. I notice YARN-2902 add the code to ignore FileNotExistent error code for LCE. Is it included in the version where you ran into this issue?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=haibochen","name":"haibochen","key":"haibochen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haibo Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-03-16T22:11:42.267+0000","updated":"2017-03-16T22:11:42.267+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13049961/comment/15929330","id":"15929330","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zhiguohong","name":"zhiguohong","key":"zhiguohong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Zhiguo","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Chongqing"},"body":"[~haibochen], the post-callback will not linearize container cleanup.

In cases where deletion threads are occupied/delayed, it can take some time to finish the last container cleanup task. Again, I don't think this is a dependency that we need to have. Even though we may potentially need to change two containerExecutors for option 1, the change should be fairly self-contained and does not change the rest of the flow.
