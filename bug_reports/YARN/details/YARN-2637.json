does not appear to be being populated in the CapacityScheduler case (but it should be, and the information is available in the submission / from the resource requests of the appliction) - populate this value, and then add a Resource property to LeafQueue which represents the resources used by active application masters - when an application starts, add it's amResource value to the LeafQueue's

I think that this actually needs to be a per cluster (rather than a per-queue) limit, based on the name & the behavior most seem to expect - except that there can be a per-queue override to the value, and most other \"values like it\" end up being evaluated at the queue level.  It seems as though either this should be a global value or possibly based on a portion of the cluster (perhaps the queues baseline portion of the cluster, then adjusted).  Most likely, the right approach is to make the \"usedAMResources\" a single per-cluster value by attaching it to the parent queue (so, abstract cs queue instance of the root queue) - which wouldn't be difficult - and then it would be per-cluster as it probably should be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-19T07:49:42.784+0000","updated":"2014-11-19T07:49:42.784+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14217583","id":"14217583","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Go ahead and allow cores to be part of the am resource limit...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-11-19T08:05:57.154+0000","updated":"2014-11-19T08:05:57.154+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14220611","id":"14220611","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patch which passes existing unit tests in the resourcemanager/capacity scheduler area.

Other things so named (userlimit, at least) are actually a percentage - and the name of this parameter tends to suggest that - but it is actually just a float value (so you would use .1 to limit to 10 percent of cluster resource, not 10...).  I did take a pass at making the change, it looks doable (with quite a few more test changes...).  On the one hand, it seems like the time to make this change, as the meaning of the value is changing considerably as it is.  On the other hand, it may be more impact than we want - as users who have configured, say, .3, will still have about the same behavior on a sizable cluster as they do today with the change as it is now, but if we modify it to actually behave as a \"percent\" value (e.g. / 100), then it will have a far more limiting impact (if the users do not adjust their configuration).  Thoughts?  Myself, I can see arguments both ways, though I'm leaning toward making the change to remove all of the \"surprise\" factor of how this parameter works...

Exception messages here should be more meaningful than \"c1\", or \"c2\".\n\nyup - fixed\n\nbq. The log level here should be info or warn level rather than debug level. In most cases, LOG.debug() should be under block of LOG.isDebugEnabled().\n\nSo, I had made this debug rather than something higher because I'm not sure we always care, and it doesn't represent a failure case - this is normal/expected case, and other similar cases for not starting the app don't log at all.  But, I can see that it will be helpful to know this, and I don't think that it will result in excessive logging - so I went ahead and made it an \"info\" level, sound good?  BTW, the \"isXYZenabled\" idiom is to save the cost of evaluating the argument construction for the log message as these can be very expensive, but for cheap cases like this (a string literal) it's not necessary as the only cost is going to be the same evaluation for logging which will happen during the call\n\nNow for the more complicated one:\n\nbq. Looks like maxAMResourcePerQueuePercent is a allowed percent for AM resource in each queue. So we may should calculate amLimit per queue rather than aggregate all applications together. \n\nSo, yes and no - the current behavior actually takes the maxAM... which is set globally and it apportions it out based on the queue's baseline share of the cluster - so if the maxam was say, 10%, and a given queue had 50% of the cluster, it would have an effective maxampercent value of 5% (it's translated into \"how many apps can I have running\" based on the minallocation of the cluster rather than actual am usage - which is the problem which prompted the fix - but the important thing to get here is the way the overall maxampercent is apportioned out to the queues)  There is also the option to override on a per queue basis, so that, in the above scenario, if you didn't like the queue getting the 5% based on the overall process, but you were happy with how other queues were working using the config, you could just override for the given queue.\n\nWhen I tried to translate this into something which was actually paying attention to the real usage of the ams, two approaches seemed reasonable:\n\n1. Just have a global used am resource value, use the global am percent everywhere (not apportioned) - this way the total cluster level effect is what we want - in this case, the subdivision of the amresource percent value is replaced with a total summing of the used resource amongst the queues.  You can still override for a given queue if you want \"this queue to be able to go higher\", which has the effective result of allowing one queue to go higher than the others, this could starve other queues (bad) but that was already possible with the other approach, albeit in a different way (when the cluster came to be filled with AM's from one particular queue.). \n\n2.  We could subdivide the global maxampercent based on the queue share of the baseline (as before) and then have a per-queue amresource percent (and amused) which are evaluated - this would not be a difficult change from the current approach, but I think it is problematic for the reason below \n\nThe main reason I took approach number one over two is that I was concerned that with a complex queue structure where there was a reasonable level of subdivision in a smallish cluster you could end up with a queue which can effectively never start anything because the final value is too small to ever be able to start one of the larger AM's we have these days.  By sharing it globally this is less likely to happen because that \"unused am resource\" allocated out to other queues which have a larger share of the cluster is not potentially sitting idle while \"leaf queue a.b.c\" has a derived maxampercent of say 2%, which translates into 512mb, and so can never start an application master which needs 1G (even though, globally, there's more than enough ampercent to do so).  It's the \"this queue can never start an am over x size\" that concerns me.  There are other possible ways to handle this with option 2, but I'm concerned that they would add complexity to the behavior and change the behavior more than is needed to correct the defect.\n\n[~djp]  Make sense?  Thoughts?  I may take a go at option 2 so we can evaluate it, but I'm concerned about the small cluster/too much subdivision scenario being problematic.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-03T17:53:50.219+0000","updated":"2014-12-03T17:53:50.219+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14233323","id":"14233323","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~cwelch],\nI think option#2 makes more sense to me, since each allocation will check queue's capcity limit only.

Since we already have MAXIMUM_AM_RESOURCE_SUFFIX, it should be enough to define how much resource could be used for AMs in a queue. And other fields of LeafQueue like {{maxActiveApplicationsPerUser}} doesn't have such a manual configuration as well. It is possible that {{maxActiveApplicationsPerUser}} and {{maxActiveApplications}} (which set manually) not match.\n\nIs there any actual requirements to add the two manual parameter? I prefer to drop the two options to keep the patch simple if there's no actual requirements.\n\nSome minor comments:\n1. The two checks may not be necessary, they will never be null:\n{code}\n+      if (application.getAMResource() == null) {\n+        throw new RuntimeException(\"Application getAMResource returned 'null'\");\n+      }\n+      if (usedAMResources == null) {\n+        throw new RuntimeException(\"Queue's usedAMResources is 'null'\"); \n+      }\n{code}\n\n2. FiCaSchedulerApp constructor\nSimilar to above, when amRequest will be null? And also when amRequest.getCapability() will be null? \nThis seems dangerous to me:\n{code}\n+    if (amResource == null) {\n+      amResource = Resource.newInstance(0, 0);\n+    }\n{code}\nYou should throw exception when amResource == null is illegal, a valid case I can think about is unmanaged AM, could you check that?\n\n3. MockRM:\nWhy this is needed? Is there any issue of original default value?\n{code}\n+  protected void setTestConfigs(Configuration conf) {\n+    conf.set(\n+    CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.MAXIMUM_APPLICATION_MASTERS_RESOURCE_PERCENT,\n+    \"1.0\");\n+  }\n{code}\n\nAnd also similar change in TestResourceManager/TestCapacityScheduler\n\n4. TestApplicationLimits\nCan you add a test for accumulated AM resource checking? Like app1.am + app2.am < limit but app1.am + app2.am + app3.am > limit. Since you have such logic in LeafQueue.\n\nThanks,\nWangda \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-12T07:48:58.312+0000","updated":"2014-12-12T07:48:58.312+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14250877","id":"14250877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Update with some changes based on [~leftnoteasy] 's comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-18T00:28:11.213+0000","updated":"2014-12-18T00:28:11.213+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14250908","id":"14250908","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~leftnoteasy] updated patch with some changes based on your comments - details below:\n\n(first the lesser comments):\n\nbq. 1. The two checks may not be necessary, they will never be null\n\nSo, yes and no.  When running \"for real\", no, never will be.  We have a multitude of mocking cases for tests, however, and at times they were.  I put these in to make the exceptions easier to understand in those cases.  As I had (previously) tracked them all down, I'll go ahead and remove these as you suggest, though I have mixed feelings about that, due to the fact that they may cause confusion for a developer down the road...\n\nbq. 2. FiCaSchedulerApp constructor\n\nSo, I have left this in - there are a plethora of different places/ways in which these are being mocked in tests, and without this it's necessary to make a great many rather intricate changes to the test mocking.  If no value is provided when running in the \"real\" case during submission this is the default anyway, it did not seem dangerous to propagate that here for the test cases which do not travel that path and therefore are subject to npe's\n\nbq. MockRM: Why this is needed? Is there any issue of original default value?\n\nTests were depending on the previous, incorrect behavior to run - the actual size of the AM's vs the cluster size was such that many tests will fail as their applications will not start (they are, effectively, \"very small clusters\").  We have targeted tests specific to the max am logic where this is not in play - for other cases I want to make sure it is \"out of the way\" so that they can concentrate on what they are testing, hence the change in value.\n\nbq. TestApplicationLimits - Can you add a test for accumulated AM resource checking? Like app1.am + app2.am < limit but app1.am + app2.am + app3.am > limit. \n\nYes, I think that's a good test to add - done\n\n-re maximumActiveApplications - this is a good question.  Before this change it was possible to effectively set this value by just doing a bit of math because the \"pretend\" AM size was a fixed value.  Now that the real AM size is being used instead, and it can vary, it's no longer possible to effectively set a \"maxActiveApplicaitons\" using the amresourcelimit.  When interacting with some folks who were doing system testing, and while going through the unit tests, I found that people were, in some cases, expecting to be able to do that/ depending on it.  We also had some unit tests which had the same expectation.  Based on these existing cases I was concerned that, without this, we would be taking away a feature that I know is being used.  I think of it is a \"backward compatibility\" requirement and I do think we need it / it has practical value.  I've not seen maxActiveApplications per user being used in this way, and it would be more difficult to do that anyway, so I did not add that ability (I'm of the same opinion that it's better not to add something where there is not a clear need for it.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-18T00:49:11.629+0000","updated":"2014-12-18T00:49:11.629+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14250987","id":"14250987","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Changing this is not something which belongs in the scope of this jira because it represents a rationalization/overhaul of mocking throughout this area (resource manager, schedulers), it is non-trivial and not specific to or properly within the scope of this change.

We shouldn't make our code consistent with previous bad code style. :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-06T01:45:06.302+0000","updated":"2015-01-06T01:45:06.302+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14265537","id":"14265537","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"reformatted some sections of testleafqueue, commenting the null check for rmcontext.getscheduler in ficaschedulerapp to see how widespread that condition is in the tests.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cwelch","name":"cwelch","key":"cwelch","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Craig Welch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-01-06T01:50:11.998+0000","updated":"2015-01-06T01:50:11.998+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12745371/comment/14265625","id":"14265625","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

The approach I use fits with the original logic in CSQueueUtils which allows a user the greater of the userlimit share of the absolute capacity or 1/# active users (so if there are fewer users active than would reach the userlimit they can use the full queue absolute capacity), the only correction being that we are using the actual value of resources by application masters instead of one based on minalloc\n\n-re 2 - Actually, the snippet provided is not quite correct, some schedulers provide a cpu value as well.  In any case, for encapsulation reasons it's better to use the scheduler's value in case its means of determining this changes in the future. \n\n-re 3 - I can't see this making the slightest difference in understandability - since these test's paths don't populate the rmapps I would simply be individually putting mocked ones into the map instead of the single mock + matcher for all the apps.  The way it is seems clearer to me as all of the mocking is together instead of distributing the (mock activity, if not mock framework...) process of putting mock rmapps into the collection throughout the test\n\n-re 4 - interesting, those were already there, but I also couldn't see why.
