Unfortunately, that method looks like it depends on {{QueueCapacities#getNodePartitionsSet}} and {{ResourceUsage#getNodePartitionsSet}}, which were implemented as part of YARN-2696. I am afraid that once we start pulling on that dependency chain, it will get complicated very quickly.\n\nAFAICT,  including all cluster node labels as implemented in the current patch will produce the correct results, it just may traverse more labels than it needs to, and the non-relevant ones will result in 0. Including all relevant labels is especially important when calculating values for the used capacity bar graph to be displayed on the parent and root queues' bar graphs in the capacity scheduler UI page.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-04T22:48:20.577+0000","updated":"2016-03-04T22:48:20.577+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12945893/comment/15192009","id":"15192009","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching {{YARH-4752-branch-2.7.002.patch}}. It addresses some of the checkstyle warnings. The findbugs warning is regarding {{ZKRMStateStore}}, which version 001 of this patch didn't change. This false findbugs warning looks to be documented in YARN-4328.\n\nRegarding unit tests, I have been trying to decide the best approach. I would like to start up a MiniYARNCluster in order to get as close to a labeled environment so that this patch can be tested. However, starting up a MiniYARNCluster, configuring multiple nodes, configuring multiple queues, configuring labels, and launching containers on both labeled and non-labeled queues will be a lot of testing overhead for a patch that will only be integrated into 2.7. There are a couple of unit tests that could be used as models, but I don't see anything that already does what would be needed.\n\n[~sunilg] and [~jlowe], I would appreciate your opinion on the best unit test approach.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-12T23:51:30.356+0000","updated":"2016-03-12T23:51:30.356+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12945893/comment/15192080","id":"15192080","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 21s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} test4tests {color} | {color:red} 0m 0s {color} | {color:red} The patch doesn't appear to include any new or modified tests.

IIUC, the computation of total-used-capacity-considers-all-labels seems wrong:\nIn your patch it is Σ(queue.label.used_capacity), actually it should be Σ(queue.label.used_resource) / S(root.label.total_resource)\n{quote}\nI think you are talking about {{getAllUsedCapacityConsideringLabels}}. IIUC, in this patch, used capacity is calculated correctly by {{CSQueueUtils#updateQueueStatistics}} when it is called by {{LeafQueue}} to allocate resources. {{updateQueueStatistics}} calls {{AbstractCSQueue#getAllUsedResourcesConsideringLabels}} to retrieve all resources consumed by the queue, including labeled resources. It then divides the consumed resources by the queue's limit:\n{code}\n  public static void updateQueueStatistics(\n...\n    Resource usedResources = childQueue.getAllUsedResourcesConsideringLabels();\n...\n      usedCapacity = \n          Resources.equals(queueLimit, Resources.none()) ? 0 :\n          Resources.divide(calculator, clusterResource, \n              usedResources, queueLimit);\n...\n    childQueue.setUsedCapacity(usedCapacity);\n{code}\nEven still, this patch is, perhaps, not ideal. When used capacity, absolute used capacity, and available resources are set, these metrics are associated with {{NO_LABEL}}. So, although the metrics reflect all used resources for a queue (even at parent levels), they are not set per label but just gathered in with {{NO_LABEL}}. In order to associate the resources with a label, I think the interface to {{CSQueueUtils#updateQueueStatistics}} may need to change.\n\nLet me get a more precise view of what it would take to backport YARN-3362.\nThanks again.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-03-28T22:33:31.574+0000","updated":"2016-03-28T22:33:31.574+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12945893/comment/15218335","id":"15218335","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"[~leftnoteasy] / [~sunilg]:\n\nYARN-3362 (Add node label usage in RM CapacityScheduler web UI) is dependent upon parts of both YARN-3361 (CapacityScheduler side changes to support non-exclusive node labels) and YARN-4162 (CapacityScheduler: Add resource usage by partition and queue capacity by partition to REST API). In turn, YARN-3361 is dependent on YARN-3356 (Capacity Scheduler FiCaSchedulerApp should use ResourceUsage to track used-resources-by-label.).\n\nThe dependencies are as follows:\n- YARN-3362 depends on YARN-3361 for the new method {{AbstractCSQueue#accessibleToPartition}}\n- YARN-3362 depends on YARN-4162 for addition of the {{CapacityScheduler}} parameter to {{CapacitySchedulerInfo}} constructor\n- YARN-3361 depends on YARN-3356 for the modifications to {{LeafQueue#canAssignToUser}}\n\nI am not comfortable with pulling all of these changes back into 2.7, especially the changes for non-exclusive node labels.

In order to get the updated changes to {{CSQueueUtils#updateQueueStatistics}} that set used capacity per label, I would need to backport YARN-2696. I did not do that since it also had other dependencies and was more invasive than I felt was needed.\n-- Instead, I added a {{getUsedCapacity}} method to {{AbstractCSQueue}} that takes a label and returns the computed used capacity for the queue for that label.\n- The {{RMNodeLabel}} class is named {{NodeLabel}} in 2.7.\n- The {{CapacitySchedulerInfo}} constructor doesn't have the {{CapacityScheduler}} parameter in 2.7, so I left it out (as you suggested previously).\n- The YARN-3362 patch has a dependency on {{AbstractCSQueue#accessibleToPartition}} which was not in 2.7. Rather than backport YARN-3361 as well, I just recrated {{accessibleToPartition}} in this patch (as you suggested previously).\n- One of the changes for {{CapacitySchedulerInfo#getQueues}} in YARN-3362 added a check to skip non-accessible queues. In 2.7, there are 2 loops that iterate over the queues whereas in 2.8, there is only 1. I put the check in the first loop because the first loop is filtering the queues to be processed by the second loop \n- I modified {{AbstractCSQueue#allocateResource}} and {{releaseResource}} to intersect with all labels in the passed {{nodeLabels}} set if the accessible node labels included the {{ANY}} selection. Without this, queue usage for root would not be preserved per-partiton and the root queue's bar graph would not display any usage at all for specific partitions.\n- Modified {{LeafQueue#getUser}} to sum all labeled and unlabeld used resources for a user on a queue. Without this, the {{Used Resource}} in the {{Active Users Info}} section would be 0.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-04-09T19:19:59.623+0000","updated":"2016-04-09T19:19:59.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12945893/comment/15233742","id":"15233742","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 19s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 6m 5s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 24s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.8.0_77 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 27s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.7.0_95 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green} 0m 40s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 33s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 15s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} findbugs {color} | {color:red} 1m 2s {color} | {color:red} hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager in branch-2.7 has 1 extant Findbugs warnings. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 20s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.8.0_77 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 24s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.7.0_95 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 0m 29s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 21s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed with JDK v1.8.0_77 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 0m 21s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 24s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed with JDK v1.7.0_95 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 0m 24s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} checkstyle {color} | {color:red} 0m 37s {color} | {color:red} hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager: patch generated 88 new + 1596 unchanged - 43 fixed = 1684 total (was 1639) {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 30s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 12s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} whitespace {color} | {color:red} 0m 0s {color} | {color:red} The patch has 2046 line(s) that end in whitespace.
