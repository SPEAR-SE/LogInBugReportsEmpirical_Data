In terms of code organization, I would like for us to create a helper method (okayToReserveResources) that would check the maxShare for all containers and maxAMShare for AM containers. \n\nAlso, looking at the code, I see fitsInMaxShare method is a static in FairScheduler.

IMHO, It is not good to add if (isValidReservation) check in FSAppAttempt#reserve because all the conditions checked in isValidReservation are already checked before we call FSAppAttempt#reserve, it will be duplicate code which will affect the performance.\nIs it possible to avoid the checks before the call, and do all the checks in the call. The reasoning behind this is to have all reservation-related code in as few places as possible. If this is not possible, we can leave it as the patch has it now.\n\nbq.

If this is not possible, we can leave it as the patch has it now.\nIMHO, it is not possible because {{FSAppAttempt#reserve}} will only be called from {{assignContainer(node)}}, if we move all the condition checks into {{FSAppAttempt#reserve}}, it may return early, which will cause failing to reserve or allocate container for other priorities, also since {{assignReservedContainer}} won't call {{FSAppAttempt#reserve}}, we still need keep {{isValidReservation}} check in {{assignReservedContainer}}.\n\nbq. Instead of adding the check to assignContainer(node) can we add it to assignContainer(node, request, nodeType, reserved)?\nIMHO, It will have problem, if we add it to {{assignContainer(node, request, nodeType, reserved)}}, then {{getAllowedLocalityLevelByTime}}/{{getAllowedLocalityLevel}} will be called before the check instead of after the check, which will change the Scheduling behavior, also it will affect the performance(late check will increase CPU usage).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zxu","name":"zxu","key":"zxu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"zhihai xu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-04T05:19:41.071+0000","updated":"2015-06-04T05:19:41.071+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12830303/comment/14574746","id":"14574746","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the clarifications, Zhihai.
