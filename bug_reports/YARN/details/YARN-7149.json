So it appears YARN-5889's change to try to balance the growth of users violated the preemption monitor's forecasting of resource assignments.  One way to fix this is to change the preemption monitor's forecasting calculations to use the old user limit calculations, however I'm wondering if we should revisit the decision to change the user limit calculations in YARN-5889.\n\nI understand the desire to try to balance user growth, but it seems like this is going to significantly slow container assignment when there are multiple active users to solve a problem that I'm not sure is a real problem in practice.  If I understand the concern properly, we want to try to avoid a situation where one user can quickly rush ahead to their full user limit, well ahead of the other users, and then before the other users get to their same limit something happens (e.g.: more users become active, cluster loses capacity, etc.).  That window should be very small in practice (i.e.: a few seconds to a few tens of seconds) because the user limit should reflect capacity that is available right now.  The speed at which the user limit is reached should only be limited by the heartbeat rate of the nodes and how picky the container requests are.\n\nI'm concerned about the new approach because it looks like it will significantly slow down container assignments.  For example there are two users, A and B, each with a single active application that is asking for many more containers than the queue can provide.  User A's app is ahead of user B's app in the queue, and the queue is initially almost empty.  Before the user limit change, the user limits for each user would be 50% since they are the only two active users in the queue.  As nodes heartbeat into the scheduler, the scheduler would aggressively assign containers, likely more than one for each heartbeat, to user A until the 50% user limit is reached.  At that point it would switch to assigning containers to user B, again likely more than one per node heartbeat.  Unless the container requests are very picky, it should only take two rounds or so of node heartbeats to satisfy both users which should only be  a small number of seconds.  With the new limit calculation, the user limits for A and B are going to be only the minimal increment over what they're using.  Therefore each node heartbeat will only assign one container to each user rather than multiple since it will keep running into the user limit before it grows.  The end result is it will take a lot more node heartbeats to get everything assigned.  That will be perceived as a slow scheduler to users.  Do we really need to keep the assignments balanced as users grow to their limit?  It looks like it will be a significant performance hit to do so since we will keep hitting the limit on each node heartbeat, cutting short the number of containers we would normally assign per heartbeat.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-09-06T14:52:05.246+0000","updated":"2017-09-06T14:52:05.246+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13099297/comment/16155619","id":"16155619","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks [~eepayne] for the detailed analysis.

I think the optimization made in YARN-5889 had two parts, one for allocation to make it gradually shared for all users (Jason has given a very detailed explanation on this), second is for preemption part. For this preemption calculation, we have to consider all users resource as some could be non-active as well.

Here I think we have to use {{getResourceLimitForAllUsers}} instead of {{getResourceLimitForActiveUsers}}\nNo, I don't think so. {{LeafQueue#getTotalPendingResourcesConsideringUserLimit}} is called during pre-preemption when attempting to calculate the total amount of resources that would be assigned to a queue if resources were to suddenly free up (by preemption). When these resources are freed up, the scheduler will use {{getResourceLimitForActiveUsers}} when deciding the amount of these resources to give to the queue. They should both use {{getResourceLimitForActiveUsers}}, which is calculating user limit for active users only.\n\nI would like to still pursue [~jlowe]'s suggestion about reverting to the pre-YARN-5889 behavior.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-09-06T18:40:10.131+0000","updated":"2017-09-06T18:40:10.131+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13099297/comment/16155872","id":"16155872","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.

IMHO, the old behavior was more consistent with the expectations of the MULP in a capacity scheduler. That is, the first users with asking apps are elevated to their user limit as quickly as possible in a FIFO order. So, the thing I'm confused about is what the use case would be for raising all asking users more evenly in a capacity scheduler context.
