This has already been happening to LinuxContainerExecutor\n and related functionality - refactored resource handler/cgroups handler, support for new resources types. \n\nAbout YARN-3291 : The patch for this JIRA already moves in the direction described in this JIRA. DockerContainerExecutor is changed to be a child of LinuxContainerExecutor (along with some minor changes to LinuxContainerExecutor itself). In addition, there are changes to the native code in the linux-specific container-executor tool which has so far only been used by LinuxContainerExecutor. I don’t believe this JIRA is a dupe of YARN-3291 - the scope differs quite a bit - more sub-tasks are to be added to this JIRA for various pieces of functionality that need to be built. \n\nthanks,\n-Sidharta ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sidharta-s","name":"sidharta-s","key":"sidharta-s","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sidharta Seethana","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-05-10T04:32:02.319+0000","updated":"2015-05-10T04:32:02.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828536/comment/14541069","id":"14541069","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just looked at this and YARN-3291 JIRA.\n\nThe main direction of both of these JIRAs as I understand is to reuse code from (a) the container-executor binary and (b) the java LinuxContainerExecutor code; so as to setup things correctly.

I think we need to revisit this and have a way to share the same code across Docker support for Windows and Linux. Another goal to keep in mind is to have DockerContainerExecutor be completely OS agnostic. As in certain cases Docker client might actually be talking to a daemon on a remote machine or a VM (which maybe Linux or Windows). Would love to hear some thoughts on how to achieve Docker support for Windows by reusing all the good work being done here.\n\nThanks!\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hrsharma","name":"hrsharma","key":"hrsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Sharma","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-12-01T03:28:16.952+0000","updated":"2016-12-01T03:28:16.952+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12828536/comment/16540726","id":"16540726","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ebadger","name":"ebadger","key":"ebadger","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Badger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"We have closed out Phase 1 of Docker container support and are now moving onto Phase 2.
