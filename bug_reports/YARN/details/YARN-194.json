Adding the ability to append to multiple log streams simultaneously is not possible in the current aggregated log format.\n\nIt would be nice to have some mechanism to get the NM to clean up logs, as currently each time the NM restarts log files are being leaked.  This has been fixed for container local directories and the distributed cache via YARN-71, but logs have been ignored.  Seems like we should be consistent about these two.
