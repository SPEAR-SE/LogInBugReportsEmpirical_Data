For example, preemption and reservation of long running containers have different implications from regular ones.\n\nPreemption of resources in YARN today works by killing of containers. Obviously, preempting long running containers is different and costlier for the apps. For many long-­lived applications, preemption by killing will likely be not even an option that they can tolerate.\n\n[Task] P​reemption also means that scheduler should avoid allocating long running containers on borrowed resources.\n\nOn the other hand, today’s scheduler creates reservations when they cannot fit a container on a machine with free resources. When making such reservations for containers of long running services, the scheduler shouldn’t queue the reservation behind other services running on a node ­ otherwise the reservation may get stuck unfulfilled forever.\n\n[Task] P​reemption and reservations logic thus need to understand if an application has long running containers and make decisions accordingly.\n\n[Task] ​There is an existing JIRA Y​ARN-­1039 (Add parameter for YARN resource requests to indicate \"long lived\"​) which was filed to address some of this special recognition of service containers. The options were between a boolean flag and a long representing the life­cycle, though in practice I think we will need to have both.\n{quote}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"[Umbrella] Recognizing services: Special handling of preemption, container reservations etc.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[{"id":"12662433","key":"YARN-1039","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12662433","fields":{"summary":"Add parameter for YARN resource requests to indicate \"long lived\"","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1","statusCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2","id":2,"key":"new","colorName":"blue-gray","name":"To Do"}},"priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/7","id":"7","description":"The sub-task of the issue","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21146&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Sub-task","subtask":true,"avatarId":21146}}},{"id":"12664396","key":"YARN-1079","self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12664396","fields":{"summary":"Fix progress bar for long-lived services in YARN","status":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/status/1","description":"The issue is open and ready for the assignee to start work on it.","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/statuses/open.png","name":"Open","id":"1","statusCategory":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/statuscategory/2","id":2,"key":"new","colorName":"blue-gray","name":"To Do"}},"priority":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/priority/3","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/images/icons/priorities/major.svg","name":"Major","id":"3"},"issuetype":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issuetype/7","id":"7","description":"The sub-task of the issue","iconUrl":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/viewavatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=21146&avatarType=issuetype","name":"Sub-task","subtask":true,"avatarId":21146}}}],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-4724/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2t8sv:"}}
