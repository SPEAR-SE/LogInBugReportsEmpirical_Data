This is different from user-limit, if we skip it, first application with large resource request may be starved. \n\nAnother problem in your example is, app1 shouldn't reserve container in node_1 because app_1's AM is running on that node too. Queue continuous reservation looking can solve this problem.\n\nClosing it as won't fix.

With my patch for reservations continue looking it should actually look at node 2 and take that one and unreserve node 1.
