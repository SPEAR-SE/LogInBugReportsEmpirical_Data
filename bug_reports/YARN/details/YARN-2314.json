When adding a new proxy to the cache and it should remove an entry, it simply grabs the least-recently-used proxy and tries to close it.  If the entry is currently in use then an entry isn't immediately removed and that means we're running with a cache larger than configured.\n\nThis can get far worse on a big cluster.  For example, if the least-recently-used proxy is currently performing a call that is stuck on socket connection retries, the LRU entry could take quite a while before it closes.  During that time each new proxy created will make the same attempt to close that proxy and fail to do so.  That means that the cache size is now N-1 larger than it should be when it finally does close where N is the number of proxies created while the LRU entry was busy.\n\nOn a large cluster with thousands of nodes a proxy hanging on one node could allow the cache to have thousands of more proxies in it than configured.  Since each proxy is a thread, that's thousands of threads, and all those thread stacks can blow container limits on the AM (or address limits if it's a 32-bit AM).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-17T18:32:55.730+0000","updated":"2014-07-17T18:32:55.730+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14066376","id":"14066376","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"While there is cache mismanagement going on as described above, a bigger issue is how this cache interacts with the ClientCache in the RPC layer and how Connection instances behave.  Despite this cache's intent to try to limit the number of connected NMs, calling stopProxy does *not* mean the connection and corresponding IPC client thread is removed.  Closing a proxy will only shutdown threads if there are *no* other instances of that protocol proxy currently open.  See ClientCache.stopClient for details.  Given that the whole point of the ContainerManagementProtocolProxy cache is to preserve at least one reference to the Client, the IPC Client stop method will never be called in practice and IPC client threads will never be explicitly torn down as a result of calling stopProxy.\n\nAs for Connection instances within the IPC Client, outside of erroneous operation they will only shutdown if either they reach their idle timeout or are explicitly told to stop via Client.stop, and the latter will never be called in practice per above.  That means the number of IPC client threads lingering around is solely dictated by how fast we're connecting to new nodes and how long the IPC idle timeout is.  By default this timeout is 10 seconds, and an AM running a wide-spread large job on a large, idle cluster can easily allocate containers for and connect to all of the nodes in less than 10 seconds.  That means we cam still have thousands of IPC client threads despite ContainerManagementProtocolProxy's efforts to limit the number of connections.\n\nIn simplest terms this is a regression of MAPREDUCE-3333.  That patch explicitly tuned the IPC timeout of ContainerManagement proxies to zero so they would be torn down as soon as we finished the first call.  I've verified that setting the IPC timeout to zero prevents the explosion of IPC client threads.  That's sort of a ham-fisted fix since it brings the whole point of the NM proxy cache into question.  We would be keeping the proxy objects around, but the connection to the NM would need to be re-established each time we reused it.  Not sure the cache would be worth much at that point.  If we want to explicitly manage the number of outstanding NM connections without forcing the connections to shutdown on each IPC call then I think we need help from the IPC layer itself.  As I mentioned above, I don't think there's an exposed mechanism to close an individual connection of an IPC Client.\n\nSo to sum up, we can fix the cache management bugs described in the first comment, but that alone will not prevent thousands of IPC client threads from co-existing.  We either need to set the IPC timeout to 0 (which brings the utility of the NM proxy cache into question) or change the IPC layer to allow us to close individual Client connections.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-18T14:05:28.332+0000","updated":"2014-07-18T14:05:28.332+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14070954","id":"14070954","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi @","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-22T21:40:41.395+0000","updated":"2014-07-22T21:40:41.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14070967","id":"14070967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jlowe], I'm interested in looking into the cache overflow side of this issue (Sorry about the last comment that I mistyped my keyboard and sent it out...). After checking your comments and the code, I think a quick fix would be, when adding a new proxy into the cache and the cache is full, instead of only relying on (and trying to delete) the least recently used item, the cache should keep checking through the whole list to find one item that is not being used by a RPC, and replace it at that place. There is one scenario that this may not actually help, and that would be the whole list of cached items are used by RPCs. I would like to check with you to see if this is a frequent case in your cluster, and if not, if this quick fix would work for the cache overflow problem. Thanks!

If we don't handle the corner case then we'll continue to grow the proxy cache beyond its boundaries as we do today, and that AM will explode with thousands of threads for what may be a temporary network outage.\n\nWhile debugging this I wrote up a quick prototype patch to try to fix the cache so that it keeps the cache under the configured limit.  Attaching the patch for reference.  However as I mentioned above, simply keeping the NM proxy cache under its configured limit means nothing if we don't address the problems with connections remaining open in the IPC Client layer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-22T22:00:39.683+0000","updated":"2014-07-22T22:00:39.683+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14071018","id":"14071018","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~jlowe]!

Basically the cache doesn't have more functionalities other than just cache the connection.\n\nIt doesn't even do that, because if we cache the connection to the NM then we leak threads.  When a cache entry is purged the RPC Client thread (tied to the NM socket connection) can linger because the RPC layer doesn't provide a way to force a connection to be closed due to protocol refcounting.  We need to set the RPC idle timeout to 0 as a workaround to force the connections to close so we don't leak threads.  Therefore all the cache is doing is caching the proxy objects with no connection behind them.  Those objects will reconnect to the NM each time we make a call.\n\nNot sure saving the proxy objects themselves is worth it -- would be interesting to prove this cache helps in a meaningful way before we assume we need it.

If you have evidence where Tez absolutely has to have this cache enabled that would be good to share.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-14T19:54:27.801+0000","updated":"2014-10-14T19:54:27.801+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14171429","id":"14171429","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To be clear, my question was only to clarify if Tez would get the benefits without doing anything because the defaults are correct.

IIUC, mayBeCloseProxy can be invoked by MR/NMClient, but proxy.scheduledForClose is always false. So it won’t call the following stopProxy.\n\nproxy.scheduledForClose is not always false, as it can be set to true by removeProxy.  removeProxy is called by the cache when an entry needs to be evicted from the cache.  If the cache never fills then we never will call removeProxy by the very design of the cache.  This patch doesn't change the behavior in that sense.  I suppose we could change the patch so that it only caches the proxy objects but not their underlying connections.  However I have my doubts that's where the real expense is in creating the proxy -- it's much more likely to be establishing the RPC connection to the NM.\n\nbq. once ContainerManagementProtocolProxy#tryCloseProxy is called, internally it’ll call rpc.stopProxy, will it eventually call ClientCache#stopClient\n\nClientCache#stopClient will not necessarily shut down the connection.  It will only shutdown the connection if there are no references to the protocol by any other objects, but the very nature of the ContainerManagementProtocolProxy cache is to keep around references.  Therefore stopClient will never actually do anything in practice as long as we are caching proxy objects.  That's why I mentioned earlier that the RPC layer itself needs to change to add the ability to shutdown connections or change the way the ClientCache behaves to really fix this if we want to continue to cache proxy objects at a higher layer.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-23T19:28:53.100+0000","updated":"2014-10-23T19:28:53.100+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12728006/comment/14181869","id":"14181869","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Jason,  thanks for your explanation.\nbq.
