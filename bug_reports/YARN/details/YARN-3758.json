The container size needs to be big enough to hold the entire process, not just the heap, so it needs to also consider the overhead of the JVM itself and any off-heap usage (e.g.: JVM code, data, thread stacks, shared libs, off-heap allocations, etc.).  If you set the heap size to the same size as the container then when the heap fills up the process overall will be bigger than the heap size and YARN will kill the container.\n\nCouple of things to check:\n- Does the job configuration show that it is indeed asking for only 256 MB containers for tasks?  Check the job configuration link for the job on the job history server or the configuration link for the AM's UI while the job is running.\n- Check the RM logs to verify what minimum allocation size it is loading from the configs and what request size it is allocating per task","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-06-02T15:07:24.995+0000","updated":"2015-06-02T15:07:24.995+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12834511/comment/14572628","id":"14572628","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Had looked into code for CS and FS.
