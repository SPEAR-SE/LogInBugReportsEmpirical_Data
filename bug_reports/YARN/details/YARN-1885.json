Generally, we should not add events to states where the transitions can never happen, that’ll hide bugs.\nAgree, and I think SUBMITTED is also cannot happen, because an app with SUBMITTED state doesn't launch any container, so NMs will not have the app in runningApplication list.

Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #1804 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1804/])\nYARN-1885. Fixed a bug that RM may not send application-clean-up signal to NMs where the completed applications previously ran in case of RM restart.
