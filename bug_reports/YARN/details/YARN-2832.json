However, the logic is very wrong. For an incorrect parameter that does not pass the \"shouldRun\" check, _serviceStart()_ would never be called because the _NodeHealthScriptRunner_ instance does not have the chance to be created (see the code snippets above).\n\n{code:title=/* NodeHealthScriptRunner.java */|borderStyle=solid}\n  protected void serviceStart() throws Exception {\n    // if health script path is not configured don't

logic should be put in the serviceInit() in NodeHealthCheckerService instead of serviceStart() in NodeHealthScriptRunner.\n\nSee the attachment for the simple
