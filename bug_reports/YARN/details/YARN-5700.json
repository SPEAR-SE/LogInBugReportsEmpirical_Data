However, this checks for the liveContainers list. Once the container is completed, it will quickly be taken out of this list. I think we can instead use {{waitForContainerToComplete()}} to check for the last set of finished containers. Something like this:\n\n{noformat}\n-    rm1.waitForState(nm1, containerId2, RMContainerState.RUNNING);\n+    NMContainerStatus completedContainer =\n+        TestRMRestart.createNMContainerStatus(am1.getApplicationAttemptId(), 2,\n+        ContainerState.COMPLETE);\n+    rm1.waitForContainerToComplete(app1.getCurrentAppAttempt(), completedContainer);\n{noformat}\n\n2) YARN-4807 changed {{waitForState()}} in MockRM.java so that it quietly returns false on failure instead of throwing an exception. In 2.8 and below, the code would call an {{assertNotNull()}} on the container to make sure that it wasn't null and throw an exception if it was. Since 2.9+ quietly returns false instead of throwing an exception, the test waits for the timeout and then continues with the test once {{waitForState()}} returns (even though it returned false). We could fix the test to check for a false return value, but there are most likely other tests that also depend on {{waitForState()}} throwing an exception on failure instead of checking the return value. So I would think that it'd be better to put the {{assertNotNull()}} back in. \n\n[~kasha], [~yufeigu] (reporter/assignee from YARN-4807), what do you think about adding the {{assertNotNull()}} back into {{waitForState()}}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ebadger","name":"ebadger","key":"ebadger","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Badger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-10-04T22:23:17.613+0000","updated":"2016-10-04T22:23:17.613+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13009275/comment/15859807","id":"15859807","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ebadger","name":"ebadger","key":"ebadger","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eric Badger","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Revisited this and I cannot reproduce the failure.
