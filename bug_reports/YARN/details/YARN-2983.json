Although the operation(get/put/remove,etc) itself on a ConcurrentHashMap is thread-safe, but a series of multiple {{ConcurrentHashMap#get}} (say, in a for loop) are not. \n\nFor instance, in code below, we are calling rmContext.getRMApps()#get in a loop. Now a ConcurrentHashMap#get can return null if the key doesnt exist. But there is no null check inside this for loop before dereferencing the value returned i.e. rmApp. Although all the applicationattempts  have been fetched for the queue just above the for loop, but as this block of code is not synchronized, there is a possibility that another thread may delete RMApp from the ConcurrentHashMap at the same time. This can happen when an app finishes/completes and number of completed apps exceed the config  {{yarn.resourcemanager.max-completed-applications}}.\nI think there should be a null check inside this for loop, otherwise a NPE can occur.\n\n{code:title=ClientRMService#getQueueInfo}\npublic GetQueueInfoResponse getQueueInfo(GetQueueInfoRequest request)\n      throws YarnException {\n  .....\n  if (request.getIncludeApplications()) {\n    List<ApplicationAttemptId> apps =\n    scheduler.getAppsInQueue(request.getQueueName());\n    appReports = new ArrayList<ApplicationReport>(apps.size());\n    for (ApplicationAttemptId app : apps) {\n      RMApp rmApp = rmContext.getRMApps().get(app.getApplicationId());\n      appReports.add(rmApp.createAndGetApplicationReport(null, true));\n    }\n  }\n  ......\n}\n{code}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12327585","id":"12327585","description":"2.7.0 release","name":"2.7.0","archived":false,"released":true,"releaseDate":"2015-04-20"}],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12688574","id":"12688574","filename":"YARN-2983.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-12-21T12:26:26.984+0000","size":1266,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12688574/YARN-2983.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"NPE possible in ClientRMService#getQueueInfo","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12763113/comment/14255156","id":"14255156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
