I was wondering why you chose to only have it in the root pom.xml. Because right now I'm doing it so that each component pom file has the excludes in it.  I don't see the technical difference in those approaches. If there is a big benefit in having one report I can change, but on the other hand if we ever split projects apart again putting them in the component pom files makes more sense.  Right now my current patch has it split. I'm just finishing testing it.
