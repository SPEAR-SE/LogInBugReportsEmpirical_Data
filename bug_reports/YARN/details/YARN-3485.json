And normally, for non-drf policy, max memory usually is set arbitrarily without real meaning.\n# I think even if headroom of fair and fifo maybe got wrong value in cpu dimension, MapReduce will not request wrong number of map and reduces. Because MapReduce use ResourceCalculatorUtils.computeAvailableContainers() to compute how much containers to ask. It will use min containers computed by two dimensions. As MAPREDUCE-6302, I think if it's related with headroom, it is probably wrong in both dimensions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peng.zhang","name":"peng.zhang","key":"peng.zhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Peng Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-04-15T03:22:17.800+0000","updated":"2015-04-15T03:22:17.800+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12820936/comment/14495742","id":"14495742","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peng.zhang","name":"peng.zhang","key":"peng.zhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Peng Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"max -memory- *cpu*  usually is set arbitrarily without real meaning.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peng.zhang","name":"peng.zhang","key":"peng.zhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Peng Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-04-15T06:33:27.266+0000","updated":"2015-04-15T06:33:27.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12820936/comment/14511913","id":"14511913","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~peng.zhang] - I am not sure I understand your latest comments. \n\nFairScheduler's Fifo and Fair policies don't consider CPU max resources when calculating headroom.
