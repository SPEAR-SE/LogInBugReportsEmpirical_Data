I believe it's because of how JobInProgress is resetting scheduling opportunities.  When it allocates a node-local or rack-local task it resets the opportunities, but if it allocates a non-local task then it explicitly avoids resetting the opportunities, with a comment stating as such.  YARN's CapacityScheduler resets the scheduling opportunities for any container allocated.\n\nSo one potential fix is to emulate the 1.x behavior and not reset scheduling opportunities when we end up assigning a non-local container.  Another is to have the CapacityScheduler track the active nodes/racks and filter requests for nodes/racks that aren't in that list when we normalize the ask list from the AM.  This would keep us from waiting around for scheduling opportunities that will never help us meet locality for an ask that's off-cluster.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-06T16:57:06.261+0000","updated":"2012-11-06T16:57:06.261+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614816/comment/13492589","id":"13492589","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thought a bit about filtering the AM's requests based on what resources are \"active\" (i.e.: nodes/racks we know about and are capable of launching containers), but it's a bit complicated with the latch-like protocol used between the AM and the RM.  Definitely possible, just a bit complicated.  In the interest of getting something working in this area sooner rather than later, here's a patch that emulates the behavior in 1.x where we don't reset the scheduling opportunities when allocating off-switch containers.\n\nLike 1.x, this still has an initial scheduling penalty for jobs that ask for containers on many off-cluster resources, but the job doesn't keep paying the penalty after each off-switch container is allocated.  Ideally we shouldn't be paying the penalty at all, hence the idea of filtering locality requests based on what is capable of being local, but we can tackle that riskier proposition in another JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-07T18:58:17.697+0000","updated":"2012-11-07T18:58:17.697+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614816/comment/13492610","id":"13492610","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"From a quick look the patch looks good.
