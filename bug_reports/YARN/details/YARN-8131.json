If not, we should write a different one to test querying/writing out subapp data. It should not be an CLI option.\r\n\r\nThe flow name, version and flow run id are inputs as CLI options and that is different from a sub-app query. If we set the wrong example in DS, then it is likely to confuse frameworks about using subapp data. Let's have a good example for sub-application data. \r\n\r\nOne thing is for sure, the data should be written \"logically\" by the AM to timeline service without caring/knowing where exactly the data ends up in the backend. Meaning, if it is a flow level value, it's stored at the flow level. If it's an application metric, it's at the app level. The AM need not be concerned that there are two tables at the backend, flow & application. All it should care for is, that this particular value belongs to flow level, that particular value makes sense at the app level and some other third value makes sense at the sub-app level. \r\n\r\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vrushalic","name":"vrushalic","key":"vrushalic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10433","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10433","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10433","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10433"},"displayName":"Vrushali C","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-04-09T17:28:09.832+0000","updated":"2018-04-09T17:28:46.881+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13151001/comment/16430992","id":"16430992","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Primarily DS is used for verifying YARN service features.
