IIRC that was added a long time back to prevent the AsyncDispatcher from calling System.exit which was occurring a lot during unit tests.  Since the default is false, unit tests that cause the dispatcher to crash don't cause the entire JVM to exit.  The places in the code where it's not a test (i.e.: daemons, MRAppMaster, etc.) explicitly set it to true so the JVM will exit on error.  If we simply change the default then we're back to unit tests exiting JVMs which isn't ideal.  To change the default to true we'd have to track down all the unit tests that need to change the setting to false before running the test.\n\nAsyncDispatcher should be using ExitUtil rather than calling System.exit directly, although we still have the issue of which way the exit behavior defaults and which ones need to override.  I bet the default was chosen to be false since the number of places in the code that need it to true are far fewer than the ones that need it to be false.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-02-21T18:26:48.547+0000","updated":"2014-02-21T18:26:48.547+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12696602/comment/13908719","id":"13908719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Also, this would be an incompatible change for all other systems using Yarn's AsyncDispatcher code.
