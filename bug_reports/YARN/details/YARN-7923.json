Jira is responding to follow up work for HADOOP-14077.  The original goal of HADOOP-14077 is to have ability to support multiple ACL lists.  When checking for proxy user authorization in AuthenticationFilter to ensure there is a way to authorize normal users and admin users using separate proxy users ACL lists.  This was suggested in [HADOOP-14060|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-14060?focusedCommentId=15875737&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#comment-15875737] to configure AuthenticationFilterWithProxyUser this way:\r\n\r\nAuthenticationFilterWithProxyUser->StaticUserWebFilter->AuthenticationFIlterWithProxyUser\r\n\r\nThis enables the second AuthenticationFilterWithProxyUser validates both credentials claim by proxy user, and end user.\r\n\r\nHowever, there is a side effect that unauthorized users are not properly rejected with 403 FORBIDDEN message if there is no other web filter configured to handle the required authorization work.\r\n\r\nThis JIRA is intend to discuss the work of HADOOP-14077 by either combine StaticUserWebFilter + second AuthenticationFilterWithProxyUser into a AuthorizationFilterWithProxyUser as a final filter to evict unauthorized user, or revert both HADOOP-14077 and HADOOP-13119 to eliminate the false positive in user authorization.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12342130","id":"12342130","name":"3.0.1","archived":false,"released":true}],"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Refine
