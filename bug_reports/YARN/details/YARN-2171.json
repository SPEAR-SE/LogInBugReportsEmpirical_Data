applications with a large number of cluster nodes) then the CapacityScheduler lock is held by that scheduler loop most of the time.  As AMs heartbeat into the RM to try to get their resources, the capacity scheduler code goes out of its way to try to avoid having the AMs grab the scheduler lock.  Unfortunately this one was missed to get this one integer value.  Therefore they end up piling up on the scheduler lock, filling all of the IPC handlers of the ApplicationMasterService and the others back up on the call queue.  Once the scheduler releases the lock it will quickly try to grab it again, so only a few AMs end up getting through the \"gate\" and the IPC handlers fill again with the next batch of AMs blocking on the scheduler lock.  This causes the average RPC response times to skyrocket for AMs.  AMs experience large delays getting their allocations which in turn leads to lower cluster utilization and increased application runtimes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-06-17T14:45:34.928+0000","updated":"2014-06-17T14:45:34.928+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12721702/comment/14033944","id":"14033944","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch to use AtomicInteger for the number of nodes so we can avoid grabbing the lock to access the value.
