It looks like it might not be affected in the same way, since it doesn't use LocalDirsHandlerService and just uses the underlying LocalDirAllocator.  I don't think the latter will auto-update the list of bad/good directories, since it doesn't appear to update unless something tries to write through it or the conf is updated.\n\nI think it could be problematic in that the ShuffleHandler will likely continue to search disks that later go bad or fail to search disks that were bad/full on startup and later became good.  If we start persisting bad/full disks across NM restart then it seems likely a map task could deposit shuffle data on a disk the ShuffleHandler will fail to search with its stale view of the disks on startup.  What do you think?  Should be addressed as a separate JIRA if a problem, but I'm trying to think of other places in the NM where we would have a similar bug and only searching good dirs for reading rather than also checking the full disks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-06-25T21:41:02.799+0000","updated":"2015-06-25T21:41:02.799+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12840650/comment/14602044","id":"14602044","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Yes this also looks like a problem.
