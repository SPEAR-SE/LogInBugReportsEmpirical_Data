I've verified that the tests pass on Mac (does not have setsid), Ubuntu (does have setsid), and Windows.  Here is an explanation of the changes:\n\n# Discussion on YARN-359 concluded that we should refactor {{getCheckProcessIsAliveCommand}} and {{getSignalKillCommand}} from {{ContainerExecutor}} back to {{Shell}}.  I'm taking the opportunity to do it now while we're working on this code.  {{isSetsidSupported}} used to return true for Windows, with the rationale being that this flag really means \"are process groups supported\".  This didn't work out in practice, because there is too much logic that is very specific to using setsid.  This had been causing the calls to winutils to prepend a '-' character to the job ID, which is incorrect.\n# \"winutils task kill\" had been terminating the job with exit code 1, but some of the YARN code depends on seeing a Unix-style exit code from signalled child processes, which is 128 + signal.  (See {{ContainerLaunch#call}}.)  The Windows {{TerminateJobObject}} API is most analogous to a kill signal, so I've changed task.c to use 128 + 9 = 137.\n# {{TestNodeManagerShutdown}}, {{TestContainerManager}}, and {{TestContainerLaunch}} were using bash scripts and signals for testing.  I wrote alternatives for Windows that use cmd and winutils.  Note that there is no equivalent to bash's ability to trap a signal, so on Windows, the assertions need to check for process existence instead.\n# Some test working directories have been shortened by switching from {{Class#getName}} to {{Class#getSimpleName}}, similar to several prior patches.\n# {{TestContainerManager}} had been requesting memory in bytes, but the API actually uses megabytes.  I'm guessing that the API changed from bytes to MB at some point, but we forgot to update this test.  This caused a very interesting problem.  {{ContainerImpl#LaunchTransition}} would apply a conversion from bytes to MB, which would cause an overflow to exactly 0.  Then, {{ContainersMonitorImpl#isProcessTreeOverLimit}} would see that the container uses > 0 MB and decide to kill it.  This is a race condition that would cause the test to fail unpredictably on Windows.  I hadn't seen the problem on Mac or Ubuntu, where it seems we were just getting lucky.  I've changed the test code to use MB.\n# {{TestContainerLaunch#setNewEnvironmentHack}} uses reflection to modify the environment during the test.
