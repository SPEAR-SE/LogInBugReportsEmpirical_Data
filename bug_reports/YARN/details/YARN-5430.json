It looks like the IP is not populated immediately, which is okay; I can retry getting the container status until the IP exists. When the IP doesn’t exist yet, getIPs throws an NPE on ContainerStatusPBImpl line 283. It seems like it would be better for it to return null in this case rather than throwing an exception. Another issue is that it looks like the hostname returned by getHost has a newline at the end. Perhaps this should be trimmed off in DockerLinuxContainerRuntime.getIpAndHost.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=billie.rinaldi","name":"billie.rinaldi","key":"billie.rinaldi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=billie.rinaldi&avatarId=30233"},"displayName":"Billie
