container and send containerStatus to RM in heartbeat ONLY ONCE. NM keeps this container until RM piggybacks to NM saying container can be removed. \n# RM releases the resources which are allocated for containers. And sends back to NM for removing container from NM's tracking.\n# In AM heartbeat to AM, RM sends completed containers details to AM\n\nICO NM Restart, NM sends outstanding NMContainerStatus lists to RM during NM registration. This status has boh RUNNING and COMPLETED containers.These containers status never send again by RM. But on NM registration , RM(RMNodeImpl.AddNodeTransition#transition) is processing only RUNNING containers. COMPLETED containers are ignored. The impact from this is Resources which are being allocated to these containers never be released from RM. At this time, RM state is completely inconsistent with actual cluster state. \n\nApplication is hanging because in the above inconsistent state, RM never allocate new containers which are asked by AM.So AM will be keep waiting for containers from RM.\n\nEarlier to YARN-2997 fix, it should work fine because those completed containers which are sent in NM registration are sent again in 1st heartbeat of NM. So RMNodeImpl handles completed containers in nodeHeartBeat event. The bug was hidden before yarn-2997 because NM was sending duplicated container status.

Majority of processing containerStatus code is same.\n\nbq. we don't remove containers that have completed from the launchedContainers map which seems wrong\nI see, yes. completed containers should be removed from launchedContainers.\n\nbq. I don't see why we would process container status sent during a reconnect differently than a regular status update from the NM\nIIUC it is only to deal with NMContainerStatus and containerStatus. But I am not sure why these both created differently. What I see is containerStatus is subset of NMcontainerStatus. I think containerStatus would have been inside NMContainerStatus. \n\nbq. Is below condition valid for the newly added code in ReconnectNodeTransition too ? \nYes, it is applicable since we are keeping old RMNode object.\n\nbq. Add timeout to the test, testAppCleanupWhenNMRstarts -> testProcessingContainerStatusesOnNMRestart ? and add more detailed comments about what the test is doing too ? \nAgree. \n\nbq. Could you add a validation that ApplicationMasterService#allocate indeed receives the completed container in this scenario?\nAgree, I will add\n\nbq. Question: does the 3072 include 1024 for the AM container and 2048 for the allocated container ? \nAM memory is 1024 and additional requested container memory is 2048. In test, number of request container is 1. So AllocatedMB should be AM+Requested i.e 1024+2048=3072","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2015-02-18T09:01:27.867+0000","updated":"2015-02-18T09:01:27.867+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12774867/comment/14326191","id":"14326191","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Attached the patch addressing all the above comments..
