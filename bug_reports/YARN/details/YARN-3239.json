So the proxy won't receive the fragments specified by the user, they are automatically stripped off.\n\nAh, yes that makes sense.  I'm +1 on the patch then.\n\nbq. Not sure how we can even combine fragments - isn't only one fragment applicable against a URI?\n\nThat's what I was wondering about and thinking we may want to complain if both the app and the client are trying to mess with fragments at the same time.  However it sounds like we won't have the ability to tell if the client is using a fragment since it doesn't send it to the server.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-23T22:30:40.096+0000","updated":"2015-02-23T22:30:40.096+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776573/comment/14335280","id":"14335280","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Any other comments?
