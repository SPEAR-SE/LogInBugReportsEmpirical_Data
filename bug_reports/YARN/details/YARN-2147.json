Looking at the exception logged at the RM side the full stacktrace shows that it was timing out trying to grab a delegation token from a remote server for webhdfs.  Those kinds of details need to be conveyed back to the client, either via the full stacktrace from the RM exception or via a more informative exception message when delegation token renewal fails during app submission.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-06-11T16:32:13.675+0000","updated":"2014-06-11T16:32:13.675+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12720612/comment/14029771","id":"14029771","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=airbots","name":"airbots","key":"airbots","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730"},"displayName":"Chen He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I make changes that can log all tokens when it fails to renew them.
