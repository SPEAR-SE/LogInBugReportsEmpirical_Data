How about adding concrete tests as a first step of generic tests on YARN-2051? What do you think, Junping Du?\nThat sounds good to me. We should add some concrete tests for some highly suspected PBImpls as the first step and refactor to/add more generic tests later. In this case, the original constructor (the one without parameter) is wrong as the object created with viaProto=false and builder to be null at the same time. We should add a unit test here. \n\nOn code format, please try to follow our code convention in hadoop wiki - Sun/Oracle java programming convention (only difference is using 2 indentations instead of 4). In this convention, we have:\n{code}\nNote: if statements always use braces {}. Avoid the following error-prone form:\nif (condition) //AVOID!
