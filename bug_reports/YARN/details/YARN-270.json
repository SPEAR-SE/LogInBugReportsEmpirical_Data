Granted this is not the same code, but it was caused by asynchronously handling events and buffering up the data so when we got behind we eventually got OOMs.  I think we will continue to see more issues as we scale up until we solve it generally, or every single client API call will have to be updated eventually to avoid overloading the system.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-12-18T15:10:48.900+0000","updated":"2012-12-18T15:10:48.900+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12623798/comment/13535188","id":"13535188","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I don't see it yet, but a comprehensive proposal can clarify what you have in mind I suppose.

We recently saw what appears to be a very similar issue show up on an MRAppMaster.  We still don't understand exactly what triggered it, but a job that would typically take 5 to 10 mins to complete was still running 17 hours later because the queue filled up which caused the JVM to start garbage collecting like crazy which in turn made it so it could not process all of the events coming in, which made the queue fill up even more. We plan to address this in the short term by making the JVM OMM much sooner than is the default, but it is still just a band-aid on the underlying problem that unless there is back pressure there is always the possibility for incoming requests to overwhelm the system.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-07T15:00:35.808+0000","updated":"2013-01-07T15:00:35.808+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12623798/comment/13601284","id":"13601284","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"changing this to not be a blocker since we have worked around and some of subtasks complete.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-03-13T16:03:31.099+0000","updated":"2013-03-13T16:03:31.099+0000"}],"maxResults":11,"total":11,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-270/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i14p3r:"}}
