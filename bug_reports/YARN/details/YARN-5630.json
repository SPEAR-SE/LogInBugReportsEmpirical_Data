In other words, if the container version is 0 then we don't store the key and instead infer that if the version key is missing then the container version must be zero.  I assume we already do this when upgrading from 2.7 to 2.8.  This would preserve the ability to downgrade as long as nothing uses the increase container resource feature that needs the new version key.  If something uses the increase container resource capability only then do we lose the ability to downgrade.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-09-09T12:43:05.989+0000","updated":"2016-09-09T12:43:05.989+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13003848/comment/15477044","id":"15477044","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch that only stores the container version key if the version is non-zero.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-09-09T13:20:11.068+0000","updated":"2016-09-09T13:20:11.068+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13003848/comment/15477115","id":"15477115","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 13s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 6m 58s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 26s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green} 0m 17s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 26s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 12s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} findbugs {color} | {color:green} 0m 40s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 17s {color} | {color:green} trunk passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 0m 22s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 28s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 0m 28s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} checkstyle {color} | {color:red} 0m 16s {color} | {color:red} hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager: The patch generated 1 new + 17 unchanged -

It adds another user-visible phase to the rollback procedure and places the burden on admins, requiring them to either know what keys are valid/appropriate to specify for the command or that they need to run a special script which embeds this knowledge.  Also simply removing the keys from the database is not going to be a proper downgrade procedure.  Those keys represent state that is important to preserve on a restart, and if we ignore it then we are dropping a user request for a container.  That's not going to be OK in the general case, as that may prevent a container from launching properly or having the proper properties when it is launched.  Depending upon the nature of the feature that added the new store keys, we may not be able to support the downgrade at all short of failing the container because we can't execute it as requested.\n\nIn the short term I think we should commit something similar to this patch to unblock the 2.8 release.  IMHO we should be OK if we support downgrades from 2.8 to 2.7 if the user does not leverage the new features in 2.8 (i.e.: container increase/decrease, queuing, etc.).  Once those features are used then a downgrade may not work.  This mirrors what was done for the epoch number in container IDs between 2.5 and 2.6.  Downgrades worked as long as the new work-preserving RM restart wasn't performed after upgrading to 2.6.  In general if we are careful only to use new store keys when they are absolutely necessary then we can support rollbacks as long as users don't use the new features added in the new release.  \n\nAfter unblocking 2.8 we can then work on the data-driven key ignoring in YARN-5547.  That will help cover another set of features where a simple delete of the keys is sufficient to perform the downgrade.  That would then leave the features where we can't just ignore keys, and we'll have to come up with some other approach or state to users that downgrades do not necessarily work once that new feature is being used.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-09-12T14:33:06.908+0000","updated":"2016-09-12T14:33:06.908+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13003848/comment/15484432","id":"15484432","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asuresh","name":"asuresh","key":"asuresh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun Suresh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In that case... +1 for the latest patch..\n\nbq. it adds another user-visible phase to the rollback procedure and places the burden on admins, requiring them to either know what keys are valid/appropriate to specify ..\nNot necessarily.
