When the RM times out the node it cannot contact the node to tell it to kill all the containers, and it forgets that those containers are there after the RM failover.  Then later when the NM re-registers it will tell the RM that it has these containers that should be dead.  The NM was never told they should be dead, and the RM forgot about them before the NM re-registered.\n\nIf the application has exited in the interim then the containers will be killed as part of app shutdown handling, but as long as the app is still active then it looks like the containers will be allowed to exist despite the RM previously telling the AM that they were gone.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-10-19T19:11:40.329+0000","updated":"2015-10-19T19:11:40.329+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12905892/comment/14964387","id":"14964387","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"yes, this's a problem in our cluster, our NM hangs for a long time because some thread we added not exit and we have not merge YARN-3585.  this happended  weeks ago,  logs are lost.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-10-20T02:06:16.715+0000","updated":"2015-10-20T02:06:16.715+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12905892/comment/14964388","id":"14964388","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"thanks [~jlowe] , you have explained very clearly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-10-20T02:07:41.096+0000","updated":"2015-10-20T02:07:41.096+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12905892/comment/14984585","id":"14984585","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandflee","name":"sandflee","key":"sandflee","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"sandflee","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Is there any plan to store NM info?
