If we use a default of zero we cannot distinguish when its unavailable versus zero usage.

I propose we make all the defaults consistently -1.\nThat's an incompatible change which sounds not necessary for now.  \n\nbq. I can fix the metrics as well to use this to implement tracking unavailable case. Opened YARN-3392 for that.\nAgree that we should have some fix on metrics side later. But even that, with changed all default values to -1, it is still a incompatible behavior with old released version. So I propose to go patch here (after fixing a minor test failure) in 2.7 given this is a blocker and we can fix YARN-3392 later in 2.8.

I think consistent and reasonable return values should be given a higher priority over compatibility.\nAgree on the priority here. However, having consistent and reasonable return values doesn't have to break compatibility (or consistent behaviors) - just like the way I proposed above, we can consistently return resource value to 0 if they are unavailable and we have an additional flag to mark if resource is available or not. \n\nbq.

In either case, I would like for the container usage metrics to see if the usage is available before logging the same.\nI agree both ways can work. However, I think adding a boolean method sounds better, at least former. More important, it doesn't break any consistent behavior of previous releases. We don't need to break it if we don't have to. Isn't it?\n\nbq. Since it is not too much work or risk, I would prefer we fix both in 2.7. This is solely wearing my Apache hat on.

Overall the API looks usable and will fix the issues.\nThanks for confirmation on this. That is important.\n\nbq. But the implementation has to do a lot of duplication of code to implement the boolean api. The CPU isAvailable is straightforward but the memory calculations seem to rely on duplicating code that does the actual calculation.\nI admit that there are some duplicate code (with getting CPU/Memory values) here. The reason I didn't do more refactor work is less risk of changing existing logic at this moment. I think we can refactor it later (in next release) to reuse logic for boolean API and get values. Anyway, this belongs to implementation not API and we don't have to finalize it now. \n\nbq. Wouldn't using it as -1 be easier instead of duplicating code to keep it as 0?\nFirst, replacing default memory resource from 0 to -1 also take extra effort and extra checking resource value is not -1 in calculating resource.\nSecond, like I mentioned above, the consumer side (ContainerMetrics, MR resource counter, new TimelineService, etc.) need to handle -1 explicitly and existing MR resource counter never have negative value for memory resource before.\nLast but not the least, as a public API, negative resource value is always more misleading than boolean API for resource available.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2015-03-27T12:30:25.080+0000","updated":"2015-03-27T12:30:25.080+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12780350/comment/14384439","id":"14384439","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I too feel the same w.r.t the code duplication.

Given there were no external developers using this before and this is the first release where we are making this public, I think we should go with the -1 approach.\n\nI also think we should clearly javadoc this class saying this should not be used for external users, it is more of an SPI for developers to extend and include their own process-tree implementation. (Writing it that way, I don't see this to be public at all, but we screwed up way back when we made this a user-visible configuration). For doing this, we should make the getResourceCalculatorProcessTree() an @Private method.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-03-27T19:20:24.313+0000","updated":"2015-03-27T19:20:24.313+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12780350/comment/14384830","id":"14384830","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Thanks [~vinodkv] for comments! \nAgree that the second comment is very important, and we should put it on public interface now.\nFor boolean API VS. negative value, sounds like more people may prefer the later one so far.

But it was never usable in practice as ResourceCalculatorProcessTree itself was private and so could have gone through multiple compatible/incompatible changes.\n - I don't know of anyone outside of Hadoop MapReduce as ResourceCalculatorProcessTree is neither public nor documented.\n    -- Besides Tez, that is.\n - 2.7.0 is the first release where we are trying to make it public: YARN-3296.\n - The API is only for developers to extend and create a new implementation. Users could never use it directly. MapReduce used it, but I think long term CPU millis for the container should come from YARN.\n    -- Except, Tez is also using it\n\nThat said, let's do this\n - Recreate the old APIs and deprecate them.\n - Remark the getResourceCalculatorProcessTree() API as Public.\n\nHere or another JIRA.
