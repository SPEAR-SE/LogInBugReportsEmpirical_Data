[~gezapeti], you've been looking at this issue more than I have; what do you think?\nIt should be a pretty simple if statement check, but my only concern is that if Hadoop 3 requires Oozie to check if Kerberos is enabled, and Hadoop 2 doesn't, Oozie will need to know if it's using Hadoop 2 or Hadoop 3, which it currently has no idea.  Unless there's some clean and easy way to do that?\n----\nI know that [~andrew.wang] really wants to get alpha2 out very soon, so perhaps we're best off reverting it for now and continuing this discussion for the beta1 release?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-12-14T02:02:52.541+0000","updated":"2016-12-14T02:02:52.541+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12862316/comment/15747232","id":"15747232","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"ok, let's revert it from trunk.
