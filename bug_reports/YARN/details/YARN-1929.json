In addition to overriding EES#becomeActive, we can override synchronized  methods or change their behaviour(CompositeService#stop,  AS#transitionToActive, RM#transitionToActive) to sleep with synchronization(a bit different, but like TestRetryCacheWithHA#DummyRetryInvocationHandler). Then we can reproduce deadlock situation step by step in test cases.\n\nIMHO, we shouldn't touch ASE, because it's also used in NameNode HA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi Ozawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-14T15:46:16.554+0000","updated":"2014-04-14T15:46:16.554+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707946/comment/13968458","id":"13968458","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
