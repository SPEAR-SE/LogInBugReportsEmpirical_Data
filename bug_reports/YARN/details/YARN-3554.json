We didn't even have this functionality until 2.6 because of rolling upgrades, and NMs don't take that long to recover in a rolling upgrade.  They recover in tens of seconds rather than tens of minutes.  Therefore I don't think it makes much sense to spend a lot of time trying to connect to an NM beyond a few minutes.  The chances of successfully connecting after a few minutes of trying is going to be very low, and NMs fail all the time anyway.  So if we spend all that extra time trying for essentially no benefit, all we've done is prolonged the application recovery time for no good reason.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-29T13:38:51.549+0000","updated":"2015-04-29T13:38:51.549+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12825658/comment/14519576","id":"14519576","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Agree with you [~jlowe], but what do you feel the ideal timeout should be, 3 mins /  5 mins ?

I'm missing how RM failover leads to a mass killing of containers due to this proposed change.  This is not a property used by the NM, so the NM is not going to start killing all containers differently based on an updated value for it.  The only case where the RM will use this property is when connecting to NMs to launch AM containers, and it will only do so for NMs that have recently heartbeated.
