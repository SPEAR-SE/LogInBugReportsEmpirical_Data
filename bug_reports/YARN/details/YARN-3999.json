So this service will not be reinitialized on every RM switch. Thinking that this would lead for processing stale events even after RM is in standby. If any case, the same RM becomes active SystemMetricsPublisher  dispatcher publishes stale events plus recovered application events. Anyway events processing will happen in the sequential order if same RM comes back Active. But issue may can ocure when the different RM becomes active i.e \n# RM1 is active and publishing the events\n# RM1 is transitioning to standby,and some events are in the queue to be updated in the timeline sever\n# RM2 become active and recovered the applications. When application got finished, RM2 systempublisher publishes app status as finished.\n# RM1 is still processing the events for app which would process bit late i.e after RM2 processed.\n\nDoesn't it cause problem?
