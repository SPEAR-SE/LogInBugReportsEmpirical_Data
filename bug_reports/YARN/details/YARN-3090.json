I kicked the tires on this patch and discovered it doesn't work.  I forced the container executor to throw a runtime exception but it wasn't logged.\n\nIt turns out I was mistaken in my earlier analysis.  The afterExecute method normally does not receive any exception because it only reports exceptions the _FutureTask run method_ throws, and normally that doesn't throw anything.  It stores any exception thrown by the underlying Runnable and almost always throws nothing itself.  Therefore afterExecute sees no exception even if one escaped during deletion, and we log nothing.  I mistakenly assumed that the thread pool executor would pass any exception stored by the FutureTask to afterExecute, but that's not the case.\n\nTo log the escaped exceptions we'd need to do something like this in afterExecute:\n\n{code}\n    @Override\n    protected void afterExecute(Runnable task, Throwable exception) {\n      if (task instanceof FutureTask<?>) {\n        FutureTask<?> futureTask = (FutureTask<?>) task;\n        if (!futureTask.isCancelled()) {\n          try {\n            futureTask.get();\n          } catch (ExecutionException e) {\n            exception = e.getCause();\n          }\n        }\n      }\n      if (exception != null) {\n        LOG.warn(\"Exception during execution of task in DeletionService\",\n            exception);\n      }\n    }\n{code}\n\nA couple of other nits on the patch:\n* The new class should be private\n* The log message should be an ERROR rather than a WARN since this should only occur when an exception escaped the exception handling already in place for deletion.  Those kinds of exceptions are usually pretty bad (like NPEs).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-04T17:04:25.469+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T17:04:25.469+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12769439/comment/14307204","id":"14307204","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~jlowe], oh is it so.
