Since currently log aggregation is asynchronous from app execution, the app will often have exited before the aggregation completes even when there isn't an issue accessing the aggregation filesystem.  If we need to provide a way for apps to know for certain that all of their container logs have been aggregated then we'd need to have log aggregation support a notification service or minimally a way for AM's to query nodes to see if an aggregation of a container has completed.\n\nDoes it make sense to split this into two parts?  We can use this JIRA to have NMs become UNHEALTHY while they are having issues accessing the aggregation filesystem (and add retries in such cases), and file a separate JIRA to add the log aggregation status/notification feature.  The former would still be useful to have without the latter.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-08-21T16:37:32.973+0000","updated":"2012-08-21T16:37:32.973+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603639/comment/13584711","id":"13584711","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I encountered this when trying to start a NM and a namenode at the same time.  The NM shut down because the namenode was in safe mode.  Having the NM die in this way introduces a dependency in the order that services are started.\n\nLog aggregation is checked each time an app is run on a node, and the app is immediately killed if a log folder cannot be used for it.  Thus, merely removing the NM killing itself on startup doesn't introduce any correctness issues.  The worst that could happen is that time could be wasted by scheduling more containers on a node we already know has connection issues to the namenode.\n\nAttached a patch that removes the NM killing itself on startup.  At initApp time, if verifyAndCreateRemoteLogDir has not been successfully completed, it is called again, and the app is failed if it fails.  If initApp fails five consecutive times, the NM sets its status to unhealthy.\n\nI agree if an NM loses its ability to connect to the namenode after an app has started, it would be good for the NMs to report that they weren't able to write their logs, but my opinion is that that is a more difficult issue and does not need to be tied to this change.
