Any preferences on how to fix it? A couple of options come to my mind:\n1. Make the AM not send the FinishApplicationMasterRequest when it detects (if it can) that the NM is killing it.\n2. Have the NM contact the RM before killing an AM container so that when the AM does send the FinishApplicationMasterRequest, the RM knows to ignore it.\n3. Make the RMAppAttemptEventType.CONTAINER_FINISHED change the state of the AppAttempt even after FinishApplicationMasterRequest has changed the state to FINISHING / KILLED.\n\nWhat do you think?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-03T19:06:47.341+0000","updated":"2013-04-03T19:06:47.341+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12544709/comment/13622823","id":"13622823","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I discussed this with Tom and Daryn.\n\n* If the NM was able to tell the AM why its being shot, the AM could technically include that diagnostic message in the FinishApplicationMasterRequest however such a mechnanism (to tell the AM the reason its being shot) doesn't exist yet and would be very brittle.\n* If the NM told the RM before shooting the AM, there would still be a race.
