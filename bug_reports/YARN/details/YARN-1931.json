We should fix MR to not depend on those, not make methods public which are never intended to be public.\nIf MR shouldn't be using these APIs, I'm happy work on moving it off of them. However, these APIs provide functionality that nearly all frameworks built on YARN need.  YARN doesn't use them internally.  Why not expose them publicly?\n\nbq. The class itself is marked private. So it won't appear in javadoc.\nRight, this is why I'm suggesting marking it Public (of course only if we determine that it's reasonable for apps to take advantage of it).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-04-12T01:13:20.251+0000","updated":"2014-04-12T01:13:20.251+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12707953/comment/13967328","id":"13967328","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To be clear, when I say \"these APIs\", I don't mean all the Private APIs that MR is using.
