The patch will cause us to continue trying to delete, but it will not report the failure to delete one or more files.

I'm thinking patterning it more like the logic in delete_as_user would make sense, where we remember if there was an error and will ultimately return an error, but we don't stop trying to delete on the first error.  delete_as_user reports the last error it received rather than the first, but it conveys the general idea.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-16T18:31:19.372+0000","updated":"2014-04-16T18:31:19.372+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708374/comment/13973192","id":"13973192","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks Jason for your comments.\nAttaching a new patch incorporating them","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-04-17T17:47:31.373+0000","updated":"2014-04-17T17:47:31.373+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708374/comment/13973234","id":"13973234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
