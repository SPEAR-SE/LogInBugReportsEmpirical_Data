Even in the regular case, RM doesn't fail the app if token renew fails, why do we need to fail the app if token-renew fails on recovery. \nAfter more discussions with [~jianhe] offline, for things like Timeline tokens which are automatically obtained whether the app needs it or not (we should fix this to be user driven), we can ignore failures. But for HDFS Tokens etc, ignoring failures is bad because it (1) wastes resources as AMs will continue and eventually fail (2) app doesn't know what happened it fails eventually.\n\nAnyways, treating renewal failures is broken today. I am okay ignoring renewal failures during recovery in this ticket.
