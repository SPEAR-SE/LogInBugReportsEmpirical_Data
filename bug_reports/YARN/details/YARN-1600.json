Unless this assumption is wrong, SPNEGO should not be required in RM. The early patch on YARN-1463 might be the easiest way to stay this way. I am for fixing it ASAP this way.\n\nWe will however extend the REST API in the future and that will likely require auth.  So we will eventually face the \"SPNEGO required in RM if security is on\" situation. Namenode is already like this. It is okay or even preferable  to make the server to fail to start if SPNEGO is not setup in this case, but still web UI accesses should not require SPNEGO-based auth.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-01-17T17:51:12.107+0000","updated":"2014-01-17T17:51:12.107+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688761/comment/13881519","id":"13881519","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This patch ports the solution in the earlier patches of YARN-1463.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wheat9","name":"wheat9","key":"wheat9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Haohui Mai","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-24T23:01:47.980+0000","updated":"2014-01-24T23:01:47.980+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12688761/comment/13883388","id":"13883388","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"+1, lgtm.
