There's one finbugs warning to fix.\nHopefully fixed it.. I think it is complaining because I am exposing final array. This too I need it for testing.

Similarly all variable names from fileDeletion to fileDeletionTask.\n - deleteHelper -> scheduleFileDeletionTask\n - fileDeletionTaskFinished\n    -- should be private.\n    -- Also the success parameter is better captured as a field in FileDeletionTask, say succeeded.\n    -- It isn't doing anything for cancelling in the recursion tail. I was expecting some kind of cancel on an individual DeletionTask.\n - We are better off tracking dependents per FileDeletionTask by having a field List<FileDeletionTask> dependentTasks instead of a global map. You can add a void addDependentTasks(List<FileDeletionTask> dependentTaskList), and similar getters/removers/size and you will be done.\n - FileDeletionTask.numberOfDependentTask is actually numberOfPendingPredecessors, right?\n - populateFileDeletionTaskDependency -> addFileDeletionTaskDependencies. And I agree with [~zjshen] that the single task-dependency is already enough for this patch.
