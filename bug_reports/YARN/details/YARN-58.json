Closed sockets are not detected until another connection is needed, or the client is closed.  That's another issue, but the NM's failure to close filesystems for a user after the app completes causes a leak of sockets in the CLOSE_WAIT state that eventually exhaust fds for the process.\n\nCalling {{FileSystem.closeAllForUGI}}, as the JT does, is troublesome that it may close the fs for other apps running as that user.  One approach is to partition the fs cache to allow each app to maintain its own cache of filesystems.  See HADOOP-8490 for possible approaches, which would allow the closing of the app's filesystems ala the JT.\n\nAlso note that failure to close filesystems causes all future jobs to use the configuration of the first job.  This will be very problematic, so it's imperative to ensure apps each get their own cached instances.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daryn","name":"daryn","key":"daryn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daryn Sharp","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-06-07T15:38:25.337+0000","updated":"2012-06-07T15:38:25.337+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12559706/comment/13291175","id":"13291175","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=szetszwo","name":"szetszwo","key":"szetszwo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=szetszwo&avatarId=23156"},"displayName":"Tsz Wo Nicholas Sze","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This looks like a problem of the newly added socket cache.
