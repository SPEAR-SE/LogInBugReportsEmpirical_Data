Instead, you can do following logic:\n{code}\nMap<UserName, Headroom> userNameToHeadroom;\n\nResource userLimit = computeUserLimit(partition);\nResource pendingAndPreemptable = 0;\n\nfor (app in apps) {\n\tif (!userNameToHeadroom.contains(app.getUser())) {\n\t\tuserNameToHeadroom.put(app.getUser(), userLimit - app.getUser().getUsed(partition));\n\t}\n\tpendingAndPreemptable += min(userNameToHeadroom.get(app.getUser()), app.getPending(partition));\n\tuserNameToHeadroom.get(app.getUser()) -= app.getPending(partition);\n}\n\nreturn pendingAndPreemptable;\n{code}\n\nAnd could you add a test to verify it works?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-02T23:55:50.160+0000","updated":"2015-09-02T23:55:50.160+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12835542/comment/14737684","id":"14737684","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks very much [~leftnoteasy]!\nI think the above is much more efficient, but I think it needs one small tweak, On this line:\n{code}\nuserNameToHeadroom.get(app.getUser()) -= app.getPending(partition);\n{code}\nIf {{app.getPending(partition)}} is larger than {{userNameToHeadroom.get(app.getUser())}}, then {{userNameToHeadroom.get(app.getUser())}} could easily go negative.

But I think it may not correct:  getHeadroom is computed by \n{code}\n     * Headroom is:\n     *    min(\n     *        min(userLimit, queueMaxCap) - userConsumed,\n     *        queueMaxLimit - queueUsedResources\n     *       )\n{code}\n(Please note the actual code is slightly different from the original comment, it uses queue's MaxLimit instead of queue's Max resource)\nOne negative example is:\n{code}\na  (max=100, used=100, configured=100\na.a1 (max=100, used=30, configured=40)\na.a2 (max=100, used=70, configured=60)\n{code}\nFor above queue status, headroom for a.a1 is 0 since queue-a's {{currentResourceLimit}} is 0.\nSo instead of using headroom, I think you can use {{computed-user-limit - user.usage(partition)}} as the headroom. You don't need to consider queue's max capacity here, since we will consider queue's max capacity at following logic of PCPP.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda

MAX_PENDING_OVER_CAPACITY. I think this could be problematic, for example, if a queue has capacity = 50, and it's usage is 10 and it has 45 pending resource, if we set MAX_PENDING_OVER_CAPACITY=0.1, the queue cannot preempt resource from other queue.\n{quote}\nSorry for the poor naming convention. It is not really being used to check against the queue's capacity, it is used to check for a percentage over the currently used resources. I changed the name to {{MAX_PENDING_OVER_CURRENT}}.\n\nAs you know, there are multiple reasons why preemption could unnecessarily preempt resources (I call it \"flapping\"). Only one of which is the lack of consideration for user limit factor. Another is that an app could be requesting an 8-gig container, and the preemption monitor could conceivably preempt 8, one-gig containers, which would then be rejected by the requesting AM and potentially given right back to the preempted app.\n\nThe {{MAX_PENDING_OVER_CURRENT}} buffer is an attempt to alleviate that particular flapping situation by giving a buffer zone above the currently used resources on a particular queue. This is to say that the preemption monitor shouldn't consider that queue B is asking for pending resources unless pending resources on queue B are above a configured percentage of currently used resources on queue B.\n\nIf you want, we can pull this out and put it as part of a different JIRA so we can document and discuss that particular flapping situation separately.\n\n{quote}\n- n LeafQueue, it uses getHeadroom() to compute how many resource that the user can use. But I think it may not correct: ...

And, I agree that we don't need to limit pending resources to max queue capacity when calculating pending resources. The concern for this fix is that user limit factor should be considered and limit the pending value. The max queue capacity will be considered during the offer stage of the preemption calculations.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric

The max queue capacity will be considered during the offer stage of the preemption calculations.\n\nI agree with your existing appoarch, user-limit should be capped by max queue capacity as well.\n\nOne nit for LeafQueue changes:\n{code}\n1534        minPendingAndPreemptable =\n1535            Resources.componentwiseMax(Resources.none(),\n1536                Resources.subtract(\n1537                    userNameToHeadroom.get(userName), minPendingAndPreemptable));\n1538  \n{code}\n\nyou don't need to do componmentwiseMax here, since minPendingAndPreemptable <= headroom, and you can use substractFrom to make code simpler.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-03T22:04:15.867+0000","updated":"2015-11-03T22:04:15.867+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12835542/comment/14988589","id":"14988589","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Moving out all non-critical / non-blocker issues that didn't make it out of 2.7.2 into 2.7.3.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-11-04T00:30:23.571+0000","updated":"2015-11-04T00:30:23.571+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12835542/comment/14996886","id":"14996886","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq. you don't need to do componmentwiseMax here, since minPendingAndPreemptable <= headroom, and you can use substractFrom to make code simpler.\n[~leftnoteasy], you are right, we do know that {{minPendingAndPreemptable <= headroom}}.

I noticed that in branch-2 and trunk, it looks like this {{required}} parameter is just given the value of {{minimumAllocation}}.\n\nSo, in {{YARN-3769-branch-2.7.006.patch}} I passed {{minimumAllocation}} in the {{required}} parameter of {{computeUserLimit}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-17T21:35:44.089+0000","updated":"2015-11-17T21:35:44.089+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12835542/comment/15009928","id":"15009928","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 0m 12s {color} | {color:blue} docker + precommit patch detected. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 2 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 2m 13s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.8.0_66 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 26s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.7.0_85 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green} 0m 16s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 31s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 16s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} findbugs {color} | {color:red} 1m 13s {color} | {color:red} hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager in branch-2.7 has 1 extant Findbugs warnings. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.8.0_66 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 27s {color} | {color:green} branch-2.7 passed with JDK v1.7.0_85 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 0m 29s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed with JDK v1.8.0_66 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed with JDK v1.7.0_85 {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javac {color} | {color:green} 0m 25s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} checkstyle {color} | {color:red} 0m 15s {color} | {color:red} Patch generated 3 new checkstyle issues in hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager (total was 1075, now 1077). {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 32s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 16s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} whitespace {color} | {color:red} 0m 2s {color} | {color:red} The patch has 2436 line(s) that end in whitespace.
