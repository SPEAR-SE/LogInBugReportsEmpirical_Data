attempts, launch failures,disk crash etc will result in decrementing score). And for all applications AMs, its always best schedule to a highest ranked NM (best performed so far).\nBut this is a very generic proposal, and we thought of achieving this step by step, and YARN-2005 was a first step for this as suggested by [~jlowe]. Coming to an improvement, your proposal is very much the same as the next step to this and it can give a better probability of a successful AM container launch for all applications. Currently there are chances that new application's first AM will still fail and only second one will be successful because of AM blacklisting.\nDownfall in achieving this is to collect the general failures (disk crashes/jvm launch problem) Vs application specific errors (some AM containers may not run on a node due to its memory or some other factors). If we cannot achieve this, then there are chances that due to one specific problem with an AM in a node may result that node to be blacklisted for all other apps, this may be dangerous. \nSo as per you thought also, I think we can collect all the other issues in container launches and segregate to generic errors, and blacklist for a period of time. +1 for this.

Yes, I've been following the discussion on YARN-2005 as well as YARN-2293. Although it would be nice to have a reliable scoring mechanism as a basis for assigning AM containers, what's implemented in YARN-2005 is actually a pretty solid solution to this problem. By the way, this is one of the more common issues our users encounter.\n\nThe only problem with YARN-2005 is that the blacklisting condition is too narrow. In fact, we rarely encounter the DISKS_FAILED error. It's usually more like INVALID (-1000) or other errors. We can try to be real precise and blacklist nodes only if the container exit status is purely due to the node itself and is not caused by the app. But maintaining that precise condition may prove to be brittle.\n\nIMO the key is that blacklisting implemented in YARN-2005 is *per-app*. As such, we can afford to be more aggressive, instead of trying to come up with the 100% accurate blacklisting condition. Since it is per-app, there is no risk one bad app can cause a node to be blacklisted for all other apps (correct me if I'm wrong). Thoughts? Do you see other risk in taking this approach?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-10-21T05:12:31.704+0000","updated":"2015-10-21T05:12:31.704+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12906432/comment/14966288","id":"14966288","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thank you [~sjlee0] for the comments.\nYes, I understood your point and got the idea from the patch also. I was having an assumption that, we are looking into a general blacklisting for all apps by seeing a failure for one app attempt in a node. Thank you for clarifying the same.\n\nThis change seems almost fine for me. But as you told, the solution is slightly aggressive in marking a node as blacklisted per app. Also I am worried about cases like preemption from RM ({{ContainerExitStatus.PREEMPTED}} or {{KILLED_BY_RESOURCEMANAGER}}). Due to some queue over usage, RM may select AM container to preempt (again this is very unlikely to happen with YARN-1496, but its possible). And if application mark this node as blacklisted due to preemption or some similar cases, its not so correct I think.

feel?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil

Again, this is a *per-app* behavior. Other apps are not affected by this decision whatever.\n\nAs for the condition for applying blacklisting, I think we can add {{PREEMPTED}} to that list (for not blacklisting). I'm not so sure about {{KILLED_BY_RESOURCEMANAGER}}. I think it is possible that an AM container can be killed by the resource manager due to a node issue. Any failure of heartbeating properly will cause the AM container to be killed by the RM, but the cause of that failure of heartbeating can be many. Just because it was killed by the RM doesn't mean definitively that it was purely an app problem. What do you think?\n\nI think we may want to approach this from the point of view of *anti-affinity*. Currently there is an inherent *affinity* to nodes when it comes to assigning the AM containers. In my view, anti-affinity is a better behavior as a default behavior. In the worst case scenario when the AM container failure was caused purely by the app, running subsequent attempts on different nodes will make it only clear the failures were unrelated to nodes. This helps troubleshooting a great deal. Today when all AM containers land on the same node, we sometimes spend a fair amount of time convincing our users that it had nothing to do with the node.\n\nThoughts and comments are welcome.
