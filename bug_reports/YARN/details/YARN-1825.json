acl_administer_queues, acl_administer_queue and acl_submit_applications, none of which control the ability to the see list of jobs in a queue.\nThis requirement is necessary because the Job History server provides a lot of potentially sensitive info in the job listing alone, e.g. a Hive map reduce job shows the query itself in the Name column.\nThe only thing we have currently available is the ability to filter by queue name, but there is no way to enforce a filter.\n\nNOTE: This is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-5750, not sure if this should go into MR or
