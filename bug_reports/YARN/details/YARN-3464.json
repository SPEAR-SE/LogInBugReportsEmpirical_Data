Can we just let it LIVE forever.\n# If there is merit to killing the ContainerLocalizer, we could have a sentinel sent for each localizer. DIE action is to be sent only when either of the two conditions are met:\n## One of the localizations failed. Since the container can't be launched, kill the localizer and fail the container.\n## The sentinel has been received *and* all previously scheduled localizations have been fetched successfully ({{LocalizerRunner#scheduled.isEmpty()}}) \n\nWhile we make these changes, I see how YARN-3465 could be useful in reducing the likelihood of this issue in the interim.
