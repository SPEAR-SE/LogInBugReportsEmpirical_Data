The description \"go busy loop\" is wrong. But there still remains starvation problem:\n\n1. {{FairScheduler#update()}} can take more than 10 sec, default value of reloadIntervalMs, with lock.\n2. {{AllocationFileLoaderThread#onReload}} can take more than 500 ms, default value of updateInterval, with lock.\n3. As a result, {{FairScheduler#update()}} and {{FairScheduler#onReload}} can always wins lock of the instance of {{FairScheduler}}.\n4. {{ResourceManager$SchedulerEventDispatcher}} can wait forever.\n\nThe problem we faced was that cluster(note that it's very busy cluster!) hung up even after killing exist apps. I got the stack trace when we faced the problem. In our case, we can avoid the problem by setting the configuration value(updateInterval) larger. IIUC, it's because we can have the margin that ResourceManager$SchedulerEventDispatcher acquire lock. \n\nAs you mentioned, this fix is just a workaround. However, it's effective. More essential way is making updateInterval and reloadIntervalMs dynamic. Please correct me if I'm wrong.
