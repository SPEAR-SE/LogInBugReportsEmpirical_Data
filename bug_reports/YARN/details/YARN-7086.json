not, one issue is that releasing a bunch of containers requires grabbing a highly-contended lock for every container released.  Do this in a loop and it ends up taking a long time since getting the lock is not cheap.  Async scheduling helps since we can wait in some other thread rather than in the AM handler threads or scheduler dispatcher thread, but it will still take a long time looping through all those events.  I think it would be a lot better if there was a bulk-release interface so we could grab the critical lock once.  We can put a limit on how many we do per batch if we're worried it will hold that lock for too long, but I don't think it's so much the actual work per container as it is the time spent waiting for the lock that makes this so painful.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-08-23T19:17:37.565+0000","updated":"2017-08-23T19:17:37.565+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097102/comment/16138947","id":"16138947","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kasha","name":"kasha","key":"kasha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I like Jason's idea.

Back in 2.7 releasing a container required the highly-contended CapacityScheduler lock to be obtained, separately, for every container released.  When releasing a lot of containers in a single AM heartbeat, this caused a long backup as the highly-contended lock needed to be reacquired for every released container.  It would have been far more efficient to just grab the lock once and release all the containers with the lock held the entire time.\r\n\r\nThe big CapacityScheduler lock appears to be gone in trunk, so I would expect the next level of locking bottleneck to be the LeafQueue lock.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2018-08-23T17:16:44.092+0000","updated":"2018-08-23T17:16:44.092+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13097102/comment/16592867","id":"16592867","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=manirajv06%40gmail.com","name":"manirajv06@gmail.com","key":"manirajv06@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manikandan R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~jlowe] Thanks for sharing the background details.\r\n\r\nAttached .002 patch to contain the changes required to acquire LeafQueue lock only once to release set of containers. Introduced wrapper methods on top of existing methods to re use the functionality wherever possible. On the flip side, ended up in traversing same set of containers for processing few more times. Please review and share your comments. If approach is fine, can drill down more to see for any further improvements.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=manirajv06%40gmail.com","name":"manirajv06@gmail.com","key":"manirajv06@gmail.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manikandan R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2018-08-26T11:21:45.068+0000","updated":"2018-08-26T11:21:45.068+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-7086/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3j7db:"}}
