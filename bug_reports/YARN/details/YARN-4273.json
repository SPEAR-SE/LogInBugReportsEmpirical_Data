When the NM registers it not only will say which containers are still running but also which applications are still active.  When the application finishes (due to being killed or whatever) then the RM will tell the NM that the app is finished, either directly on the reconnect event because the app is unknown or from RMAppImpl when it gets the APP_RUNNING_ON_NODE event.  So I don't think these will be leaked forever.  Eventually the app will finish and the NM will be told about it.  When the NM hears the app is finished, it will kill all containers belonging to that app.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-10-16T14:34:18.880+0000","updated":"2015-10-16T14:34:18.880+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-4273/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2n43b:"}}
