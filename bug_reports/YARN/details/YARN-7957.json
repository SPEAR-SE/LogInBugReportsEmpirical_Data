Now, YarnApplicationState does not have a state which represents DELETED or DESTROYED. So, when a service is destroyed, if YARN Service writes to ATS  a string which does not have any enum reference, is that acceptable? Or do we have to introduce this state in some enum? ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gsaha","name":"gsaha","key":"gsaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gour Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-02-24T03:25:52.058+0000","updated":"2018-02-24T03:25:52.058+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13140033/comment/16375289","id":"16375289","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think if we have service state which is similar to YarnApplicationState, it will be better.
