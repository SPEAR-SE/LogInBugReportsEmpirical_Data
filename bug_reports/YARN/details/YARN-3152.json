Seems like you were able to see the same behavior what i mentioned in step 2 but wanted to know more about step3 where in i see the actives services getting oscillated between the 2 RM servers. Is it the same behavior as i mentioned or i am missing something.

As you mentioned i feel WARN should be sufficent for this issue or we can adopt the approach specified by [~kasha] in YARN-3607 and change the behavior to log WARN by default and if {{yarn.fail-fast}} is specified to true then have the current behavior. thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-07-15T09:33:38.111+0000","updated":"2015-07-15T09:33:38.111+0000"}],"maxResults":18,"total":18,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-3152/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i25adz:"}}
