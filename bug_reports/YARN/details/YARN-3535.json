Then suddenly the AM is notified of a released container 000004 that apparently was never allocated?  I do not see a corresponding \"Got allocated\" message that would indicate the AM ever saw container 000004.  That may explain why the AM is stuck.  If the RM thought it allocated a container to the AM and it was released then it will think all asks are satisfied.  However the AM would need to re-ask for the final map container or the job will not progress.

I believe the container was killed in the first place because the RMNodeImpl reconnect transition makes an assumption that is racy.  When the node reconnects, it checks if the node reports no applications running.  If it has no applications then it sends a removed node eventfollowed by a added node event to the scheduler.  This will cause the scheduler to kill all containers allocated on that node.  However the node will only know about a container iff the AM acquires the container and tries to launch the container on the node.  That can take minutes to transpire, so it's dangerous to assume that a node not reporting any applications on the node means it doesn't have anything pending.\n\nI think we'll have to revisit the solution to YARN-2561 to either eliminate this race or make it safe if it does occur.  Ideally we shouldn't be sending a remove/add event to the scheduler if the node is reconnecting, but we need to make sure we cancel containers on the node that are no longer running.  Since the node reports what containers it has when it reconnects, it seems like we can convey that information to the scheduler to correct anything that doesn't match up.  Any container in the RUNNING state that no longer appears in the list of containers when registering can be killed by the scheduler, as it does when a node is removed, and I believe that will fix YARN-2561 and also avoid this race.\n\ncc: [~djp] as this also has potential ramifications for graceful decommission.  If we try to graceful decommission a node that isn't currently reporting applications we may also need to verify the scheduler hasn't allocated or handed out a container for that node that hasn't reached the node yet.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-04-23T14:36:37.354+0000","updated":"2015-04-23T14:36:37.354+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822913/comment/14509256","id":"14509256","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peng.zhang","name":"peng.zhang","key":"peng.zhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Peng Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"As per [~jlowe]'s thoughts, I understand here are two separated thing:\n# During NM reconnection, RM and NM should do sync at container level.

I think the method recoverResourceRequestForContainer should be synchronized, any thought?\nI notice it's not with synchronized originally. I checked this method and found only \"applications\" need to be protected( get by calling \"getCurrentAttemptForContainer()\" ). \"applications\" is instantiated using ConcurrentHashMap in derived scheduler, so I think it's no need to add synchronized.\n\nOther three comments are all related with test. \n# Changing TestAMRestart.java is because that case testAMRestartWithExistingContainers will trigger this logic. After this patch, one more container may be scheduled, and attempt.getJustFinishedContainers().size() may be bigger than expectedNum and loop never ends. So I simply change the situation.\n# I agreed that this issue exist in all scheduler, and should be tested generally. But I didn't find good way to reproduce it. I'll take a try with ParameterizedSchedulerTestBase.\n# I change RMContextImpl.java to get schedulerDispatcher and start it in test TestFairScheduler. Otherwise event handler cannot be triggered.

Please correct me if I am wrong.\nIn ContainerRescheduledTransition code, its been used like\n{code}\n+      container.eventHandler.handle(new ContainerRescheduledEvent(container));\n+      new FinishedTransition().transition(container, event);\n{code}\nHence ContainerRescheduledEvent is fired to Scheduler dispatcher and it will process the {{recoverResourceRequestForContainer}} is a separate thread. Meantime in RMAppImpl, {{FinishedTransition().transition}} will be invoked and it will be processed for closure for this container. If the Scheduler dispatcher is slower in processing due to pending event queue length, there are chances that recoverResourceRequest may not be correct.\n\nI feel we can introduce a new Event in {{RMContainerImpl}} from ALLOCATED to WAIT_FOR_REQUEST_RECOVERY and scheduler can fire back an event to {{RMContainerImpl}} indicate recovery of resource request is completed. This can move the state forward to KILLED in {{RMContainerImpl}}. \nPlease share your thoughts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sunilg","name":"sunilg","key":"sunilg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sunil Govindan","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2015-07-16T07:16:43.544+0000","updated":"2015-07-16T07:16:43.544+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12822913/comment/14629369","id":"14629369","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=peng.zhang","name":"peng.zhang","key":"peng.zhang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Peng Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"bq. there are chances that recoverResourceRequest may not be correct.\n\nSorry, I didn't catch this, maybe I missed sth?. \n\nI think {{recoverResourceRequest}} will not be affected by whether container finished event is processed faster. \nCause {{recoverResourceRequest}} only process the ResourceRequest in container and not care its status.
