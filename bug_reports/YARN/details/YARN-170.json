The NodeStatusUpdater is the component responsible for communicating with RM constantly. In some cases, like a network parition, or when RM reboots, RM asks the NMs to shutdown or reboot. In this case, NodeStatusUpdater needs to inform its parent i.e. NodeManager to shutdown. To avoid stopping it directly, it should ideally send a signal to the NM.
