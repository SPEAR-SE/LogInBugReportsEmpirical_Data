I don't know since when CS and FS scheduler is the only option for hadoop YARN but this break our promise to make scheduler pluggable - yes. current yarn is still pluggable but if every upgrade can potentially breaking third-party schedulers (given no guarantee of stable) then what this pluggable meaning for?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2017-08-31T19:54:54.657+0000","updated":"2017-08-31T20:12:46.512+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13098701/comment/16150036","id":"16150036","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~djp], \n\nThanks for suggestions.\n\nRegarding to scheduler of K8S, it works quite different comparing to YARN: K8S supports customized scheduler or even multiple schedulers concurrently running so POD can choose to use different schedulers when it is submitted to the cluster.\n\nHowever, OTOH, In K8S, there's no official \"scheduler\" API.

Regarding to scheduler of K8S, it works quite different comparing to YARN: K8S supports customized scheduler or even multiple schedulers concurrently running so POD can choose to use different schedulers when it is submitted to the cluster.\nAgree that it is different so far, but the way how K8S works now may hint the direction that YARN could leverage in future - especially for long running services with extremely scale. Taking federation as an example, we are working on support for one application to ask resources on multiple clusters now. But technically, there is no hard restraint for apps to ask resource from one kind of scheduler which means it potentially can ask resource from multiple clusters which run different schedulers (at least can mix with FS and CS scheduler). If that becomes true someday, then how far between YARN and K8S in scheduling (at least for this scenario) then?\n\nbq. In K8S, there's no official \"scheduler\" API.\nThat's not true. K8S website (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/) document how to implement a customized scheduler with several pre-define APIs and these APIs even get versioned (so far is version 1). For more details, you can refer: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/algorithm/scheduler_interface.go\n\nbq. So we can say, scheduler of K8S makes decision by invoking POD/binding to assign POD to node. That's the only contract for customized scheduler, which is not descriptive enough but very simple to maintain compatibility.\nHmm... I agree that K8S scheduler logic could be simpler than YARN so far but that doesn't have to mean that maintaining compatibility is also simpler. Actually, maintaining several basic APIs' compatibility is not that hard for YARN by following current public API update protocol - just instead of changing long existing APIs but adding new APIs with mark old one as deprecated. maintaining allocated() definitely belong to this case. \n\nbq. However since YARN scheduler is too much coupled with other RM components, so it is almost impossible to keep API stability of scheduler, and beyond API, scheduler need to handle internal RM events, which we never ensure compatibility before.\nThat's unfortunately true. However, ideally, a good design should make YARN scheduler API to be more independent with implementations of these RM events - the later should always get updated for new scenarios.\n\nbq. To be frank, I don't see big benefit of making scheduler API stable now, adding customized scheduler is never recommended by Hadoop community and vendors. And I can expect declare stability of scheduler API could slow down innovations in scheduler side.\nThis is not true. CS and FS is not born for the first day when Hadoop comes. Even for YARN, FS are added much later than CS. How can we assume there is no better scheduler than CS/FS for YARN in future? About innovation, I don't understand how declaring stability on several APIs could slow down things here? I am more worried about less people could be interested to join contribution of their ideas as discouraged by non-stop changing APIs.\n\nbq. Had some discussions with Carlo Curino / Subru Krishnan / Konstantinos Karanasos during Hadoop summit regarding to how to better design scheduler semantics, I suggest to declare scheduler API stability once we reach there.\nCan you share more details on these discussions? better to be document somewhere for broader audiences. We never reach a place that we can safely declare something is the best and absolutely stable. Instead, we should ask ourselves - are we comfortable to claim current APIs are good and relative stable? If not, keep evolving these APIs to a relatively good and stable status should be first citizen task for YARN community.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2017-09-01T09:49:05.492+0000","updated":"2017-09-01T09:49:05.492+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13098701/comment/16154346","id":"16154346","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~djp] for additional comments: \n\nbq. That's not true. K8S website (https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/administer-cluster/configure-multiple-schedulers/) document how to implement a customized scheduler with several pre-define APIs and these APIs even get versioned (so far is version 1). For more details, you can refer: https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/plugin/pkg/scheduler/algorithm/scheduler_interface.go\nI'm not familiar with golang, so please correct me if I was wrong. My understanding of {{scheduler_interface.go}} is, it provided suggested APIs for scheduler, but it is not a public API. Signatures like {{v1.Node}} means it use {{Node}} api inside v1 API package. But it doesn't claim scheduler API stability itself. Could you point me if you have any ref of claiming scheduler API stability for K8S?\n\nbq. Agree that it is different so far, but the way how K8S works now may hint the direction that YARN could leverage in future - especially for long running services with extremely scale ..\nInstead of following K8S's model to let app choose scheduler, I would like to let a \"router\" module to choose scheduler for app -- this is also the model used to implement RM federation's. Blindly letting multi-scheduler run independently in the cluster could cause lots of resource accounting and maintenace issues: every scheduler could account resource once so it could cause over allocation, etc. \nTo clarify, I agree with the idea of making a better API for scheduler and declare stability so we can support easier pluggability in the future. However I don't think it is the time to claim that now before we clean up scheduler implementation. It doesn't helpful and even discouraging to developers if we claim existing scheduler API to stable.\n\nbq. Can you share more details on these discussions?\nI can try to summarize what we discussed, no conclusions so far:\na. https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12867869/YARN-6592-Rich-Placement-Constraints-Design-V1.pdf, \"implementation design\": by adding a ResourceRequestPreprocessor to look at scheduler state and request, and forward hard-locality request to scheduler to do allocation. User can plug their own \"ResourceRequestPreprocessor\" to do request to node binding. \nb. {{YARN-5139-Global-Schedulingd-esign-and-implementation-notes-v2.pdf}} in YARN-5139 suggested an approach to introduce NodeScorer and committer interface so users can implement their own scorer to lookup cluster states and send allocation proposal to scheduler to do allocation.\nI personally prefer b. than a.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-09-05T21:29:08.193+0000","updated":"2017-09-05T21:29:08.193+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13098701/comment/16154351","id":"16154351","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I suggest to convert this JIRA to a task (instead of bug) to introduce better scheduler APIs as a long term goal and remove 2.9.0, 3.0.0-beta1 from target version, probably we can try to see if we can get some reasonable scheduler API definition with the development of YARN-6592 (which is targeted to 3.1 or 3.2).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leftnoteasy","name":"leftnoteasy","key":"leftnoteasy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=leftnoteasy&avatarId=18647"},"displayName":"Wangda Tan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2017-09-05T21:33:27.546+0000","updated":"2017-09-05T21:33:27.546+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13098701/comment/16193996","id":"16193996","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree with [~wangda]; though it might be cleaner to close this as \"Won't Fix\" and file a new JIRA.
