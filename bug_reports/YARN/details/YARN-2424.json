I can certainly understand the desire to run cgroups without needing local users. But transitioning to security is not a binary process for most users (or, at least, it doesn't have to be...)\n\nThe problem with the current code base is that someone moving to a secure mode now has to either enable cgroups (which, as pointed out in YARN-1253 is irrelevant for security) or cut everything over at once.  Enabling LCE prior to enabling security allows for a two step transition and eases problem determination when doing the security upgrade.  Is that user missing from the system or is Kerberos failing?  Clearly the issues stemming from the former can be sorted out without security.  This makes the operations side of the house much easier.\n\nIt's also worth pointing out that one of the key benefits of running tasks as the user who submitted them is that it makes troubleshooting much easier.  When one hops on a node, it is evident as to which user's tasks one is looking at it, even if those tasks aren't validated as \"that\" user.  This is especially important in heavy multi-tenant  scenarios.\n\nBut, again, the fix in YARN-1253 caused a regression.  LCE w/out security was supported prior to Hadoop 2.3 and was definitely used by people.    This change still sets the default to be LCE w/either one user or security, but now for folks who want the prior behavior, they can flip a flag and get it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-08-17T22:26:07.847+0000","updated":"2014-08-17T22:26:07.847+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12734607/comment/14100158","id":"14100158","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"please go over todd's comment over the security issues on sudoing as user without secure auth. definitely you don't want to do that in a multi-tenant cluster. \n\nbtw, fixing a security bug is not a regression.
