The rpc layer internally retries for a certain time period. From the NM layer, we should probably have a total time length defined - say 15 mins and retry after 30 seconds or so within that time period. \n  - also someone should be able to set the time period to -1 to disable the upper bound and retry forever if needed.\n  - use same conventions as used elsewhere when naming variables - rm_Retry_interval_ms does not confirm to the standards defined in the class.\n  - \"LOG.debug(\"Fail to connect to RM\");\" - change to error and log the exception stack trace unless it is being caught elsewhere and being printed. It would also help to log how many retries were attempted before failing out.\n  - in the start() function, there is an AvroRuntimeException being thrown - we should replace that with YarnException or an appropriate runtime exception. \n  - isRMStarted var is not needed - a simple break in the loop if the registration is done should suffice. \n  - please remove the space in \"rm_Retry_Count --;\"\n  - the debug log message at the end of the loop should be set to use WARN level. Also, please re-phrase it for more clarity - something along the lines of Retrying connecting to RM, current no. of failed attempts ...\n  - the current patch seems to be catching all exceptions. This will cause a problem in the case where the RM explicitly asks the NM to shutdown - maybe it makes sense to move the retry logic into the registerWithRM function?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-08T22:45:23.449+0000","updated":"2013-02-08T22:45:23.449+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538494/comment/13576156","id":"13576156","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Not sure if \"After that period of time, NM will throw out exceptions\" is valid in yarn-default.xml. A better description could mention that the NM will shutdown if it cannot connect to the RM within the specified max time period. \nDescription should also mention how to use -1 to retry forever.\n\nEarlier comment had a point of switching to using SECONDS instead of MS for users to understand more easily.\n\n+      // this.hostName = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName();\n  - Please remove commented out code if not being used.\n\nUnit test does not really seem to be testing the flow of RESOURCEMANAGER_CONNECT_WAIT_MS being set to -1. waitForEver is being explicitly set to true/false based on the updater's ctor and not really based on the config value. If that flow cannot be tested, it might be better to remove the additional complexity from the test.\n\nAlso, patch will need to be updated due to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-9112. \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-02-22T02:11:50.706+0000","updated":"2013-02-22T02:11:50.706+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538494/comment/13585000","id":"13585000","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
