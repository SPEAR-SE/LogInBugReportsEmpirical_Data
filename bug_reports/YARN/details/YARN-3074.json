I actually wanted a different message to be printed in logs for these exceptions. I can probably write a small method to consolidate these duplicate lines.\nIf you want to include separate messages, then separate sections is probably fine. However, the \"cause\" message in the exception/FSError will give more information, so separate message is probably not necessary. If you do choose to have separate catch blocks, the message for FSError should probably say \"filesystem error\" rather than \"disk error.\" The FSError may be related to the filey system, but not necessary a problem with the disk. Also, I would not add the overhead of a separate method just to save a couple of lines of code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-02-03T14:48:30.364+0000","updated":"2015-02-03T14:48:30.364+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12768746/comment/14304233","id":"14304233","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I vaguely remember that [~vvasudev] had a bug report and more analysis on these type of errors somewhere.
