I just modified the way to indicate the error, such that the callers of it can more easily handle the error. If you think calling getLocalizedResources() when the container is not at LOCALIZED is not wrong, I'm afraid we're in the different conversation.\n\nbq. which is completely misleading.. Indeed this occurred because user killed container not because it failed to localize resources.\n\nI don't think the message is misleading. Again, getLocalizedResources() is not allowed to be called when the container is not at LOCALIZED (at least the original code means it). So the message clearly states problem. Please note that killing signal is not the root problem of the thread failure here. If getLocalizedResources() were not called, the thread would still complete without exception. \n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-31T18:11:50.017+0000","updated":"2013-07-31T18:11:50.017+0000"}],"maxResults":17,"total":17,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-966/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1mlcf:"}}
