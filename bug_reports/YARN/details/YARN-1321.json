Because NMTokenCache is a singleton NMTokens for the same node from the different AMs step on each other.\n\nThe patch that I'm working preserves the current behavior (singleton NMTokenCache) while allowing a client to set a NMTokenCache instance to the AMRMClient/NMClient (and Async versions). If an instance is set, then the NMTokens are stored in it instead of the singleton. This preserves backward compatibility both in behavior and in API.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-10-19T03:20:51.482+0000","updated":"2013-10-19T03:20:51.482+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674568/comment/13799751","id":"13799751","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Attached a patch with the proposed solution.\n\nSo far this is the only issue we've run while using multiple AMs in a single JVM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2013-10-19T03:26:21.592+0000","updated":"2013-10-19T03:26:21.592+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12674568/comment/13799770","id":"13799770","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Avoiding this was the reason why we made it a static singleton. NMTokenCache is a shared object between AMRMClient and NMClient. It's weird that someone outside has to create it and set it for both clients. How about the following?\n - AMRMClient clearly 'owns' NMTokenCache. It is the producer - obtains NMTokens from RM and populates them. So we don't need a setter for AMRMClient. AMRMClient creates the cache and returns it for consumers.\n - In that light, making setNMToken() public was a clear mistake, but something that we can live with.\n - When we create a NMClient, we pass the above token-cache returned by AMRMClient. The default constructors/static factories for NMClient can use the single-ton.
