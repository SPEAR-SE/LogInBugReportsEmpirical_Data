For me, they said something like \"protocol not supported\". The reason was that a different hadoop RPC was running on the port it was connecting to. It took me a lot of debugging to find out that it was just talking to the wrong service because it had not read it's configuration file...","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"69040","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Yarn examples use wrong configuration","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erich.schubert","name":"erich.schubert","key":"erich.schubert","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erich Schubert","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=erich.schubert","name":"erich.schubert","key":"erich.schubert","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erich Schubert","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609062/comment/13462920","id":"13462920","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"This is interesting.
