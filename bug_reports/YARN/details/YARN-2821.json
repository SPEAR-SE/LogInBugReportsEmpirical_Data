And in the finish() method, we compare numFinishedContainersOfcurrentAttempt==numContainersAskedByCurrentAttempt; will this work ? I know doing this, the total finished containers may be larger than user specified, but given this is just an example app, maybe tolerable ? \n\nOn the other hand, the current patch may not work on
