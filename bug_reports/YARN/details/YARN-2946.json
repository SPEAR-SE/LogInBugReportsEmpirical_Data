related flows. As \"AsyncDispatcher event handler\" on waiting for ZK client releases ZKRMStateStore object's lock but holds on to StateMachineFactory$InternalStateMachine obj's lock, during this time some other thread can take lock on ZKRMStateStore object's lock which is not correct. So i suggest the flows where we are setting the Zkclient to null and checking for other ZKConnection we can have new object and remove the current syncronization on ZKRMStateStore's instance","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-12-10T14:19:02.884+0000","updated":"2014-12-10T14:19:02.884+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760740/comment/14241439","id":"14241439","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Looking into deep RMStateStore and ZKRMStateStore, all the ZK updation are done by obtaining the lock on ZKRMStateStore.class \n# Either directly on ZKRMStateStore.

For all above mentioned method's causing deadlock , introduce StateMachine in RMStateStore like handling application store. So all the execution flows from StateMachine->zkRMStateStore.class. \nI think this is a reasonable way. We can call the transitions synchronously in each storeToken or storeMasterKey methods.   This way we make all store operations follow the same path - all going through state machines","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-12-14T03:03:35.979+0000","updated":"2014-12-14T03:03:35.979+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12760740/comment/14247672","id":"14247672","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"Thanks [~jianhe] and [~varun_saxena] for your suggestions.\n\n[~jianhe] , I am trying to understand before implementing state machine for DT keys updates on store,  is there any specific reason why state machine was not implemented?
