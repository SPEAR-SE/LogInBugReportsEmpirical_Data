Could you also change it to not show the button if you aren't an admin?  I don't want to confuse users by having a button there that doesn't do anything.\n\nOne other thing is could you add some css or something to make it look more like a button.  Right now it just looks like text and I didn't know it was clickable at first.   The placement of it seems a bit weird to me also but as along as its only showing up for admins that is less of an issue.\n\nI haven't looked at the patch if details but I see we are creating a new AdminACLsManager each time.
