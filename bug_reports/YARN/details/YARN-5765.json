For some reason that I am not aware of, umask(0027) did not work for me. And here is my theory why it does not work.\nPlease correct me if I am wrong.\n\nIn a nutshell, in my case, the appcache directory is first created with ownership being \\{user: systest, group: hadoop\\} and gid set. Then because systest does not belong to group hadoop in my cluster setup,\nchmod(appcache, perm) that runs as user systest will clear the gid. Consequentially, all the subdirectories and files created under appcache by code that runs as systest will not be owned by group hadoop any more.\nNM that runs as a user that only belongs to hadoop will have no permission to these files/directories.\n\nIn my experiment with umask, it seems to me that chmod clears the gid as long as systest does not belong to hadoop, regardless of the umask. If umask approach has been working for you, I must have misunderstood\nyour approach and will verify your patch once it's posted. One alternative I can think of, is to revert YARN-5287 patch and follow the other approach as you pointed out (explicitly set umask) to fix YARN-5287.

I'd expect this to work since I have tested a similar change. While I am testing it in a cluster, we can discuss what is the best place to put the umask() system call. IMHO, create_validate_dir may not be the best place to put it. The reason being processes that execute mkdirs() may not notice their umasks have been modified to 0027 in create_validate_dir(). If a process, say root (I am not sure though whether umask(0027) is  unwanted by root), wants to use a different umask other than 0027, it will need to remember to call umask again after mkdirs().  Instead, I think we can call umask() right after fork in launch_container_as_user() or in create_container_directories(). This way, only umask of the child process that runs as the user will be changed to 0027.

As we never run the container-executor.c binary with root user refer (set_user -> check_user) and would it be sufficient to reset the umask after mkdir ?\"\nI was more concerned about any future changes, who will just call mkdirs without knowing that it actually changes umask. Resetting the umask mitigates possible side effects. All in all, if the umask change is chosen, I think it is best to put it into create_container_directories.\n\"One more question is if we reset the umask after mkdir then will the container logs created will be accessible to the NM because of restrictive rights ? would be ideal to set default ACL for the folders created and reset the umask so that files created by the user under these directories have the rightful permissions?\"\nI think a more future proof approach to default acls and umask could be a feature like the current bin/container-executor --checksetup, when specifying the user and root dir tells the administrator, if the user/dir has the right settings to run containers. It gives an advice what needs to be set if it does not. This has a different philosophy, I admit.\nDoes this answer your questions?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com","name":"miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com","key":"miklos.szegedi@cloudera.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=miklos.szegedi%40cloudera.com&avatarId=32342"},"displayName":"Miklos Szegedi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2016-11-15T00:01:48.684+0000","updated":"2016-11-15T00:01:48.684+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13014318/comment/15666267","id":"15666267","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=Naganarasimha","name":"Naganarasimha","key":"naganarasimha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Naganarasimha G R","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"[~vvasudev], i think i need to resolve the issue as fixed in trunk so that we have proper release notes right (so that the changes have this information of the revert)?
