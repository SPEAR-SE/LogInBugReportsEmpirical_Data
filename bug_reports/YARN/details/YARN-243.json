If the AM told the client that the job failed then the job should have failed.  The fact that the attempt died between the time it told the client the job final status and the RM can happen, and IMHO we should fix things so the subsequent AM attempt doesn't retry the job but rather simply updates the RM with the failed status found from the previous attempt.  Otherwise we run into bad situations where we've already told the client the job failed, but the job subsequently retries (possibly from scratch, depending upon the output format support for recovery) and could succeed.  If the job has decided to fail and has already told the client, an AM attempt failure while trying to report that same decision to the RM shouldn't allow the job to subsequently succeed, IMHO.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-26T16:57:20.997+0000","updated":"2012-11-26T16:57:20.997+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617556/comment/13503996","id":"13503996","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Filed MAPREDUCE-4819 to track the issue where the AM can re-run the job after reporting success to the client.
