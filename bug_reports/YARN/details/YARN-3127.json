So if 10000 apps are maintained then so many additional non required events are getting triggered. this we need to address. And for the issue pointed by [~xgong], i had asked for suggestion of approach being taken and hence waiting for it, AFAIK we need to ensure first ATS events are sent and then store the final application state to RMstate store in FINAL_SAVING transition (and also other possible cases where app is created and will be killed b4 attempt is created in which case  FINAL_SAVING is not called).
