It does this by counting the number of missed scheduling opportunities the application has had. When the count reaches a certain threshold, the app will accept the rack-local node. The documented recommendation is to set this threshold to the #nodes in the cluster.\n\nHowever, there are some early-out optimizations that can lead to this delay being a very long time. \nExample in allocateContainersToNode():\n{code}\n   // Try to schedule more if there are no reservations to fulfill\n    if (node.getReservedContainer() == null) {\n      if (calculator.computeAvailableContainers(node.getAvailableResource(),\n        minimumAllocation) > 0) {\n        if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n          LOG.debug(\"Trying to schedule on node: \" + node.getNodeName() +\n              \", available: \" + node.getAvailableResource());\n        }\n        root.assignContainers(clusterResource, node, false);\n      }\n{code}\n\nSo, in a large cluster that is completely full (AvailableResource on each node is 0), SchedulingOpportunities will only increase at the rate of container completion rate, not the heartbeat rate, which I think was the original assumption of YARN-80. On a large cluster, this can lead to an hour+ of skipped scheduling opportunities meaning the fifo'ness of a queue is ignored for a very long time.\n\nMaybe there should be a time-based limit on this delay as well as a count of  missed-scheduling opportunities.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Capacity scheduler can wait a very long time for node locality","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/YARN-3309/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i26jf3:"}}
