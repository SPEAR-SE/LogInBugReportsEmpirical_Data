Therefore every time the \nRM asks the RPC server for the client's UGI we will continue to get the old one.  Since the RM thinks the client is still using the token that was used when the connection was established, it continues to regenerate tokens (and emit corresponding logs) every heartbeat for the interval between when the new key was rolled and when it is activated (i.e.: as long as nextMasterKey != null).\n\nTo tell whether the client really is using the new token we either need the RPC connection to be re-established or a way to tell the RPC layer to re-authenticate the connection.  I don't believe there's a good way to do either of those given the RPC API, so this patch works around the issue a bit by comparing the token we have recorded for the app attempt with the next key.  It solves the problem of regenerating tokens unnecessarily for the same app attempt.  However we will continue to send the token each heartbeat since we cannot tell whether the client really has the new token.

The only concern is if we don't do anything, it is possible for AMs to get authentication failures\n\nIf we don't do anything then AMs who fail to update their token will continue to work as long as they don't have their RM connection dropped.  Force-closing the connection or reauthenticating over the same connection just makes the auth failure happen sooner.  Apps will work better without changing anything, since an app with a recently expired token will likely be able to talk with the RM for hours or days and usually avoid the auth failures we're worried about.\n\nI agree we should find a way to \"fail fast\" for this scenario, but also agree it's probably non-trivial to do so if we can't force-close the connection via the existing RPC API.  If it's not going to be fixed for 2.7, I'd rather put in a fix so we don't have the RM regenerating the same token every heartbeat and the corresponding logs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-12T15:58:41.529+0000","updated":"2015-02-12T15:58:41.529+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770400/comment/14319268","id":"14319268","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"make sense to me. committing this.
