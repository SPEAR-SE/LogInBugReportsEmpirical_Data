is tokenB, the other is the one renewed on RM (tokenA). If tokenB is selected when connect to HDFS and tokenB expires, exception happens.\n\nSupplementary: this problem happen due to that AM didn't use the service name as the token alias in credentials, so two tokens for the same service can co-exist in one credentials.
