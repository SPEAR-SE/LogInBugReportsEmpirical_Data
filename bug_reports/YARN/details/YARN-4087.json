Writes may be of 2 kinds - critical and non-critical. E.g. saving an application submission is critical. Saving a node information is perhaps not critical. It would affect system correctness is critical write operation errors are allowed to be ignored. We end up with YARN-4118 and other such potential issues. Essentially we are turning a write-ahead log into something that optional. I dont see how the system can make stable reliability guarantees by making the write-ahead log non-fatal.\nOn the other hand read errors or non-critical write errors should not block RM progress but do need to be potentially retried. That also does not seem to be addressed in the patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-09-08T01:19:10.899+0000","updated":"2015-09-08T01:19:10.899+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12859484/comment/14734122","id":"14734122","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8 #359 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk-Java8/359/])\nYARN-4087.
