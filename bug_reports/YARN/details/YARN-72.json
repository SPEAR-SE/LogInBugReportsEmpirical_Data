Three events are dispatched to make this happen: a COMPLETED_CONTAINERS event is handled by the ContainerManager, which dispatches a KILL_CONTAINER event for each container to be killed, which the ContainerImpls handle by dispatching CLEANUP_CONTAINER events, which are finally handled by the ContainersLauncher, which tries to kills the containers.\n\nDoes it make more sense to use this chain events or to try to call the kill code directly?  For the former, the issue would be how do we know when the cleanup has been completed?  It looks like ContainerImpls have their state changed when their containers are killed, so the shutdown code could monitor them until they all reach the correct state, but a fair bit of plumbing would be required for the shutdown code to be able to get to them.  For the latter, similar plumbing would be required for the shutdown code to reach the ContainerImpls, and the other issue would be circumventing the event system, which might have consequences that I'm not able to foresee?\n\nThis is my first foray into nodemanager code, so maybe someone who understands it better can provide some perspective?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-10T19:12:03.622+0000","updated":"2012-10-10T19:12:03.622+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543607/comment/13481923","id":"13481923","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"My patch only handles killing containers on shutdown, not previous ones when starting back up.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-22T23:23:55.172+0000","updated":"2012-10-22T23:23:55.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543607/comment/13485330","id":"13485330","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Do we intend to stall shutdown indefinitely for this activity?\n{code}\n+    while (!containers.isEmpty()) {\n+      try {\n+        Thread.sleep(1000);\n+      } catch (InterruptedException ex) {\n+        LOG.warn(\"Interrupted while sleeping on container kill\", ex);\n+      }\n+    }\n{code}\n\nThis patch deserves some good tests to verify the new functionality.\n\nOverall the approach seems reasonable but I will defer to someone with a better understanding of NM.\n\nI was wondering if the NM could make itself part of a process group (like setsid) such that everything it spawns is also part of that process group.
