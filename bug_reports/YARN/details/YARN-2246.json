I did some investigation:\n\n1. When generating proxyTrackingUrl from originalTrackUrl, the original host section is replaced by \"[proxy host]:[port]/proxy/[application id]\", while the following sections are kept. For example,\n{code}\nhttp://192.168.1.108:19888/jobhistory/job/job_1404265212778_0003\n{code}\nin translated into\n{code}\nhttps://0.0.0.0:8088/proxy/application_1404265212778_0003/jobhistory/job/job_1404265212778_0003\n{code}\n\n2. On the other hand, in WebAppProxyServlet, \"[application id]\" section is used to search for originalTrackingURL, and the following part is appended to the end of originalTrackingURL. For example, we will see\n{code}\nhttp://192.168.1.108:19888/jobhistory/job/job_1404265212778_0001/jobhistory/job/job_1404265212778_0001\n{code}\nFortunately, JHS will simply ignore the additional sections, such that we won't see an apparent error. \n\nTherefore, with the current logic, whenever AM provides a tracking url that has more sections after host:port, it will be finally translated into an url that has duplicate sections after host:port.\n\nIt seems we should either hide all the rest sections in proxyTrackingURL, or not append them when WebAppProxyServlet recovers the originalTrackingURL.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-02T10:37:25.013+0000","updated":"2014-07-02T10:37:25.013+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14049813","id":"14049813","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Move the ticket to YARN, as the root cause sound like the YARN issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-02T10:40:40.294+0000","updated":"2014-07-02T10:40:40.294+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14308101","id":"14308101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I think the bug is in RMAppAttemptImpl.  When the AM unregisters, RMAppAttemptImpl.generateProxyUriWithScheme will take whatever URL the AM specified and replace the server with the proxy URL, e.g.: tracking URL http://x/y/z becomes http://rmaddr/proxy/appid/y/z.  Then when the webproxy processes that URL it just replaces http://rmaddr/proxy/appid with the tracking URL, leading to http://x/y/z/y/z.  IMHO the proxy URL advertised to clients should always be http://rmaddr/proxy/appid, without other stuff tacked on the end.  That can map to whatever tracking URL the app provided when processed by the webproxy.\n\nI also wonder if we should list the final tracking URL on the RM UI rather than the proxy URL.  Seems simpler to just direct them to the final tracking URL rather than through the RM proxy, unless there's a use case where the client can't reach the final tracking URL directly and needs to go through the proxy.

Now with the current proxy server, proxy server gets the latest application report and decides whether to get the Job details from the AM or redirect the URL to history based on the application state.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-07T10:30:28.287+0000","updated":"2015-02-07T10:30:28.287+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14310677","id":"14310677","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

However I'm not sure changing WebAppProxyServlet is the best fix.  For example, if I navigate through an active applications UI (via the proxy link), I might end up at a place like http://<rmaddr>/proxy/<appid>/x/y/z.  Then the application completes and sets a history tracking URL to http://<histaddr>/job/<jobid>.  If I refresh that page then I would expect, if the application framework properly designed a seamless view between the AM UI and history UI, that the history page would serve up the same information at http://<histaddr>/job/<jobid>/x/y/z.  With this patch, it looks like it's going to send me to http://<histaddr>/job/<jobid> and strip off the x/y/z part.\n\nInstead I think it would be better if the proxy servlet preserved the existing behavior and instead in the RM UI we never advertised a tracking URL other than http://<rmaddr>/proxy/<appid>.  So I think the real bug is in RMAppImpl rather than the WebAppProxyServlet per my previous comment above.  In addition I don't think it's safe to assume that a query string ripped off of an arbitrary path underneath the proxy URL will be OK to apply at the top level of the history URL.  In many cases there isn't going to be a query string, and the path underneath the proxy URL is significant.  The query string is often going to be context-sensitive to the path, and we would be ignoring that path.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-09T21:26:25.312+0000","updated":"2015-02-09T21:26:25.312+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14312927","id":"14312927","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Deverej, thanks for the explanation! It makes sense to me. I've tried the patch, and it seems to work fine for MR case. However, I'm wondering it's a general solution for all applications.\n\nNow in the patch, *res* will still be appended to the tracking url for running. It's correct because MR set the tracking url to {{http(s)://am host:am port}}. The tracking url just has the authority, but no section else afterwards. So when you requesting resource under {{http(s)://proxy host:proxy port/proxy/appId/static/yarn.css}}, it will be translated to {{http(s)://am host:am port/static/yarn.css}}, which is correct. However, if unfortunately your resource is not at the root, but at {{http(s)://am host:am port/base}}, and you use it as the tracking url, your proxy url will become {{http(s)://proxy host:proxy port/proxy/appId/base/static/yarn.css}}, and *toFetch* will be finally translated to {{http(s)://am host:am port/base/base/static/yarn.css}}, which has double \"base\" and is wrong. This is why the tracking url is wrong for the completed apps, which has been updated to {{http(s)://jhs host:jhs port/jobhistory/job/jobId}}.\n\n\nIMHO, the proper fix should be that: If the tracking url is {{http(s)://tracking authority/S1/Sk/.../Sk}}, it should be *still* translated to the proxy url {{http(s)://proxy authority/proxy/appId/S1/Sk/.../Sk}}. When the proxy url is translated to the track url, we should not just replace authority, but mapping the whole {{http(s)://proxy authority/proxy/appId/S1/Sk/.../Sk'}} to {{http(s)://tracking authority/S1/Sk/.../Sk'}} when {{k' <= k}}, and to {{http(s)://tracking authority/S1/Sk/.../Sk/Sk+1/Sk+2/.../Sk'}} when {{k' > k}}.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-09T21:38:32.129+0000","updated":"2015-02-09T21:39:56.391+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14312963","id":"14312963","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

That link is just wrong.  When the web proxy sees that link, it (correctly, IMHO) translates it to http://<histaddr>/job/<jobid>/job/<jobid>/x/y/.

In these cases, we need to make sure it is translated properly.\n\nI believe it will be translated properly, as it works today (i.e.: one can successfully navigate deeper in the MapReduce UI on the AM while the job is running).  As long as we don't change the web proxy servlet, that should continue to work.  I think the bug is simply how RMAppAttemptImpl handles the web proxy when the app unregisters, specifically in RMAppAttemptImpl#generateProxyUriWithScheme.  It is trying to do a replace the authority of the tracking URL with <rmaddr>/proxy/<appid> when it should just make the proxied tracking url always http://<rmaddr>/proxy/<appid>.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-09T23:03:02.413+0000","updated":"2015-02-09T23:03:02.413+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14313178","id":"14313178","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jlowe], I think we're on the same page about what's reason of duplicate section of the tracking url.\n\nbq.

I believe it will be translated properly, as it works today\n\nMaybe I was not clear before. I didn't meant MR AM UI will not work, but seamless view between the AM UI and history UI is not possible nowadays. For example, I'm at {{http://zshens-macbook-pro.local:8088/proxy/application_1423523667600_0001/mapreduce/task/task_1423523667600_0001_m_000000}} when the app is running.

It's no longer the mapper page but the app summary page, because {{mapreduce/task/task_1423523667600_0001_m_000000}} are useless sections in JHS.\n\nThink it out loudly. In general, seamless view will still be difficult with the aforementioned solution between two tracking URLs. For example, tracking URL is {{http://t1:p1/a/b}} first, and I'm visiting the path at {{http://t1:p1/a/b/x/y/z}}. When the tracking URL becomes {{http://t2:p2/c/d/e}}, I refresh the package and am redirected {{http://t2:p2/c/d/e/a/b/x/y/z}}. Without mapping between original tracking url and proxy url, we don't know */a/b* is part of tracking url base, and it shouldn't be carried on.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-09T23:45:39.870+0000","updated":"2015-02-09T23:45:39.870+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14313217","id":"14313217","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In fact, it seems we don't need to fix RMAppAttemptImpl#generateProxyUriWithScheme, and even don't  need to update the proxy tracking url at all when registering and unregistering.

But it should also be wrong with current translation way.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-10T00:47:34.725+0000","updated":"2015-02-10T00:47:34.725+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14313926","id":"14313926","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree that this needs to be handled in RMAttemptImpl before exposing the proxy URL to the users.\n\nThanks for your patch [~zjshen].

Do you suggest that we should use the original tracking url directly instead of proxy url on the web UI?\n\nNot sure if it's always OK to use the raw history tracking URL, as there might be some setups where the client can reach the RM but can't reach the history tracking URL directly.  However I think it's OK to always have the RM advertise the original proxy tracking URL (i.e.: http://<rmaddr>/proxy/<appid>) to clients through its UI.  The AM can redefine what that proxy redirects to, but the RM should never tack on paths to that proxy URI when advertising it.  In other words, clients visiting http://<rmaddr>/proxy<appid> will always reach the UI (either AM or history), and if the AM and history have properly mirrored UIs then it should be seamless to transition between the two when the AM unregisters and redefines the tracking URL to point to the history server.\n\nbq. seamless view between the AM UI and history UI is not possible nowadays.\n\nCorrect, but that's MapReduce's fault and not YARN's.  If the RM handles the proxy properly then it should be possible for an app framework to implement a properly mirrored UI between the AM and the history server.\n\nbq. In general, seamless view will still be difficult with the aforementioned solution between two tracking URLs. For example, tracking URL is http://t1:p1/a/b first, and I'm visiting the path at http://t1:p1/a/b/x/y/z. When the tracking URL becomes http://t2:p2/c/d/e, I refresh the package and am redirected http://t2:p2/c/d/e/a/b/x/y/z. Without mapping between original tracking url and proxy url, we don't know /a/b is part of tracking url base, and it shouldn't be carried on.\n\nNot sure I'm following the example because there's no proxy URLs in it.  The client should always be using the proxy URL for this discussion.  If I follow the example correctly, the original tracking URL is http://t1:p1/a/b, and the proxy URL is rooted there (i.e.: proxy/<appid> -> t1:p1/a/b).  So I'm visiting proxy/<appid>/x/y/z and then the AM unregisters with a new tracking URL of t2:p2/c/d/e.  Then the proxy servlet should redirect that same proxy/<appid>/x/y/z request to t2:p2/c/d/e/x/y/z which seems correct to me.  It's just taking the path underneath the proxy address (i.e.: everything after proxy/<appid>) and tacking it on the specified tracking URL.  The same subpath is seen by both the AM and history URIs, assuming a/b is the root of the AM UI and c/d/e is the root of the history UI (for that app).   So it seems this works as I would expect.  Am I missing something?\n\nbq. I have updated the generateProxyUriWithScheme() in the latest patch.\n\nThanks for updating the patch, Devaraj.  I think it looks good, although it would be nice to have some regression tests to verify that if the app changes the tracking URL that the proxy URL doesn't update like it used to.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-02-10T15:16:15.002+0000","updated":"2015-02-10T15:16:15.002+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548014/comment/14314305","id":"14314305","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~jlowe] for looking into the patch and confirming the approach.
