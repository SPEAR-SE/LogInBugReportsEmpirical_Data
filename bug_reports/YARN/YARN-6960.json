        "description": "YARN-2026 introduced the notion of only considering active queues when computing the fair share of each queue. The definition of an active queue is a queue with at least one runnable app:\n\n{code}\n  public boolean isActive() {\n    return getNumRunnableApps() > 0;\n  }\n{code}\n\nOne case that this definition of activity doesn't account for is that of long-running applications that scale dynamically. Such an application might request many containers when jobs are running, but scale down to very few containers, or only the AM container, when no jobs are running.\n\nEven when such an application has scaled down to a negligible amount of demand and utilization, the queue that it's in is still considered to be active, which defeats the purpose of YARN-2026. For example, consider this scenario:\n\n1. We have queues {{root.a}}, {{root.b}}, {{root.c}}, and {{root.d}}, all of which have the same weight.\n2. Queues {{root.a}} and {{root.b}} contain long-running applications that currently have only one container each (the AM).\n3. An application in queue {{root.c}} starts, and uses the whole cluster except for the small amount in use by {{root.a}} and {{root.b}}. An application in {{root.d}} starts, and has a high enough demand to be able to use half of the cluster. Because all four queues are active, the app in {{root.d}} can only preempt the app in {{root.c}} up to roughly 25% of the cluster's resources, while the app in {{root.c}} keeps about 75%.\n\nIdeally in this example, the app in {{root.d}} would be able to preempt the app in {{root.c}} up to 50% of the cluster, which would be possible if the idle apps in {{root.a}} and {{root.b}} didn't cause those queues to be considered active.\n\nOne way to address this is to update the definition of an active queue to be a queue containing 1 or more non-AM containers. This way if all apps in a queue scale down to only the AM, other queues' fair shares aren't affected.\n\nThe benefit of this approach is that it's quite simple. The downside is that it doesn't account for apps that are idle and using almost no resources, but still have at least one non-AM container.\n\nThere are a couple of other options that seem plausible to me, but they're much more complicated, and it seems to me that this proposal makes good progress while adding minimal extra complexity.\n\nDoes this seem like a reasonable change? I'm certainly open to better ideas as well.\n\nThanks,\nSteve",
