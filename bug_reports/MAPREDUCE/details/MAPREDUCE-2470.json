If a MR Job has been retired for around mapreduce.jobtracker.persist.jobstatus.hours hours (default 1 hour), then it is removed by the JobTracker from mapreduce.jobtracker.persist.jobstatus.dir (default /jobtracker/jobsInfo on HDFS). Once it's removed, the Counters are no longer available when fetching information about the Job. Going one step further, the JobTracker caches the last 1000 (default) MR Job info's in memory, yet even if it's still available in the cache and can be viewed through the Web UI, when you try and fetch the Counters programmatically but has been removed from HDFS by the JT, then you still get NULL returned from the JT, instead of an empty set of Counters. \n\nSo, the real question for me, is this bad behavior by the JobTracker? Or should the Hadoop client library be the one to handle the NULL and either pass NULL along to user-code, or create an empty set of Counters? Whichever it is, it'd be very nice to have it documented in the Javadocs, including the old API as well as the new API.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=drizzt321","name":"drizzt321","key":"drizzt321","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Baff","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-11T16:37:15.470+0000","updated":"2011-05-11T16:37:15.470+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506109/comment/13032114","id":"13032114","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"That was the fix we were looking at.

What if the JobTracker has the data cached in memory? Couldn't it be possible to return the values from there instead of the HDFS file? Or would that be a bunch of work to see if it is still in memory?\n\nJust wanted to highlight that this is an NPE at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Counters.downgrade(Counters.java:77), not just needing to get the Javadocs updated.
