Just my gut feeling would be that we need a way to handle an error in a Stop Container Request.  We may need an event back indicating that the TA_KILL failed. Perhaps we could retry it a few times before giving up instead of the event back.\n\nAlso the container launched and started talking to the App Master requesting something to do.  The App Master always responded with I have nothing for you to do.  It might be good if the code that informs the Container what to do could know about killed attempts and if for some reason they ask for something to do they are told to die.  This seems like a good way to prevent this type of error in the future.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-27T14:38:04.568+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T14:38:04.568+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528959/comment/13137190","id":"13137190","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Two things we can do for this:\n - TaskAttempt should register with TaskAttemptListener even *before* the container is launched. Today the registration happens only after the container launches.\n - It should register with TaskAttemptListener.taskHeartBeatHandler *after* the container is launched so that heartBeatHandler doesn't start counting down even before the container is launched.\n - And of course, fix the obvious bug, that is send a DIE to the task, if it is not registered with TaskAttemptListener.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-27T15:45:46.907+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T15:45:46.907+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528959/comment/13137253","id":"13137253","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I agree that is the way to go.

I am going to try and do some more extensive testing on it to be sure it fixes the deadlock before I declare victory and submit it.\n\nI am also trying to understand how or even if to handle CONTAINER_REMOTE_LAUNCH and CONTAINER_REMOTE_CLEANUP as related in ContainerLauncherImpl.  I am not even sure that it would make a difference.  In the logs for the AM I can see that CONTAINER_REMOTE_LAUNCH for the errant attempt has returned successful before CONTAINER_REMOTE_CLEANUP is sent.  The race appears to not be in the AM as much as it is in the NM.  The NM will respond back that the container has been launched but it will not launch it yet.  Launching appears to be something that can take quite a while to finish.  If the CLEANUP arrives while that is happening the internal state of the NM does not know that the launch is in progress, and as such it fails.  I think for us to tie the two together in the AM would also require us to tie the two even closer together in the NM as well.  MAPREDUCE-3240 marks the process as launched by having it write out a PID file from the process itself.  But that does not guarantee that once NM.startContainer has returned that NM.stopContainer will stop that container.  It would require the NM to mark a container as being launched before the startContainer completes and it would require stopContainer to mark the container as needs to be stopped if it is in progress.\n\nAll of this sounds like more work then can get done today.  So I will try to test my patch without the changes.  If everything seems to work then I will files a separate JIRA to address the atomicity issues with startContainer/stopContainer in the NM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-28T15:23:56.815+0000","updated":"2011-10-28T15:23:56.815+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528959/comment/13138655","id":"13138655","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I am wrong.
