Just one more thing, the number of containers does not give the break up of how many are used by each of the map and reduce task i.e. information such as 3 map tasks running using 3 containers and 1 reduce task running using 1 container. \n\nThis information is very useful for High RAM jobs. E.g. for a High RAM job which has 3 map tasks, each requiring 2 containers and 1 reduce task requiring 1 container, displaying the number of containers as 7(6+1) would not convey the number of containers actually used by each task. Perhaps something like \"Map Containers\" and \"Reduce containers\" would be useful. Thoughts?

Thanks for catching these issues.\n\n> 1. Need a null check for 'currentAttempt' in RMAppImpl.\nDone.\n\n> 2. In RMAppAttemptImpl.getApplicationResourceUsageReport: \n>   1. You need to acquire the readLock.\nI don't think the read lock would be effective or necessary here. Please tell me if my logic is faulty :D  :\n* Within {{RMAppAttemptImpl.java}}, {{getApplicationResourceUsageReport()}} calls {{scheduler.getSchedulerAppInfo(...)}} to get an instance of the SchedulerAppReport object. This instance variable is local to {{getApplicationResourceUsageReport()}} and contains copies of the {{live}} node and {{reserved}} node lists, not pointers to the actual lists themselves.\n** Even if this instance of SchedulerAppReport contained pointers to the {{live}} and {{reserved}} node lists, the private readlock within the RMAppAttemptImpl class would not be honored by anything changing those lists, so this readlock would not be effective.\n** Since this instance of SchedulerAppReport and its container {{live}} and {{reserved}} variables are local to {{getApplicationResourceUsageReport()}}, I don't think one thread can access the local variables of another thread, even if they are running in the same code. So, I don't think the readlock is needed, even for the sake of re-entrance.\n\n>   2. Reserved containers loop needs a +=, not =\nDone. Good catch.\n\n\n> 3.
