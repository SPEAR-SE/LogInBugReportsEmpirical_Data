I'll upload a new patch that renames that local variable.\n\nI was coming up against the following situation: an attempt that had a speculative attempt running completes, causing the job to complete.  speculative(Map|Reduce)Tasks would be decremented because there were other running attempts.  When a job completes, the number of waiting tasks is decremented by pendingMaps (initialTasks=10 + speculativeTasks=0 - runningTasks=1 - finishedTasks=10 - failedTasks=0) = -1.  Thus, after the job had completed, there would still be 1 task counted as waiting for it.\n\nThere didn't seem to be a clear definition of speculative(Map|Reduce)Tasks, so the one I came up with is that the number of speculative(Map|Reduce)Tasks is the number of attempts running that are not on the critical path of the job completing.  This makes sense in the context of computing pending(Map|Reduce)s, which is the only place the variable is used.\n\nI removed the decrement of speculative(Map|Reduce)Tasks on task completion because, by definition, an attempt that completes a task is on the critical path.  Any remaining running attempts will be failed and counted as speculative.  Similarly, the decrement is added where an attempt has failed, because an attempt that fails is only on the critical path if the task hasn't completed and there are no other speculative attempts.\n\nDoes that make sense?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-03T16:20:34.103+0000","updated":"2013-05-03T16:20:34.103+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595798/comment/13650285","id":"13650285","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

First, please excuse in advance any errors I'm about to make here.  Trying to be careful, but the counting code is subtle and has been hard to think about.\n\nbq. An option is to just call decWaiting(Maps|Reduces) in JIP.garbageCollect with JIP.num(Maps|Reduces)... currently if you follow the opposite side i.e addWaiting(Maps|Reduces), they are just static and are done at JIP.initTasks with num(Maps|Reduces).

The definition of speculative(Map|Reduce)Tasks, at least in my head, has been the number of task-attempts have an alternate...\n\nThis definition can lead to thinking there are fewer pending tasks than there actually are.  Consider the following situation:\nMy job has two maps.  Attempts are run for both of them.  One map gets a speculative attempt because it's running slow.  The other map's attempt fails.  The speculative one completes.  initialMaps=2 + speculativeMaps=0 - runningMaps=1 - finishedMaps=1 - failedMaps=0.  So pendingMaps is now 0 even though we have a pending map task.  The way this has not caused jobs to starve is that the running speculative map will fail later on and bring pendingMaps back up to 1.\n\nWanted to make sure it was clear that the current behavior is wrong in an objective way.  If your stance is still that the code has been working so far and messing with it is just a bad idea, I trust your experience.  In that case, we could keep speculativeMapTasks how it is and have a separate variable, nonCriticalRunningTasks, that is used for updating the metrics?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-16T17:06:33.858+0000","updated":"2013-05-16T17:06:33.858+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595798/comment/13660470","id":"13660470","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
