therefore before the RM tries to kill the AM).  However this introduces another problem: if something goes wrong with the AM (killed, crashed, hung) between the time it has removed the staging directory and before it has notified the RM then the RM will think the AM did not complete successfully and it will either report the job as failed (after the AM already told the client it was successful) or worse, the RM will launch another AM attempt and fail because the staging directory has been removed.\n\nSeems like we need another RMApp state to track the fact that we've succeeded but are still cleaning up.  For example, when the AM unregisters, we go from RUNNING into a new FINISHING state.  The RM then gives the AM so many seconds to exit on its own.  If the AM container doesn't exit on its own within the time limit then the RM kills the container, but in either case we move to the FINISHED state (i.e.: once we're FINISHING, we're going to get to FINISHED one way or another).\n\nI'm not thrilled with the idea of adding yet another state to app/attempts, but other alternatives seem to open doors to the AM failing at just the wrong time and we end up failing the job after the AM has already told the client the job was successful.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-04-03T21:09:13.477+0000","updated":"2012-04-03T21:09:13.477+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549329/comment/13248909","id":"13248909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch to add new FINISHING state to app/appattempt.

Initially I thought a quick fix would be to change MRAppMaster so the call to cleanupStagingDir() occurs before stopping all the services (and therefore before the RM tries to kill the AM). However this introduces another problem: if something goes wrong with the AM (killed, crashed, hung) between the time it has removed the staging directory and before it has notified the RM then the RM will think the AM did not complete successfully and it will either report the job as failed (after the AM already told the client it was successful) or worse, the RM will launch another AM attempt and fail because the staging directory has been removed.\n\nA similar situation would still exist. During service shutdown, all exceptions are ignored (logged) - and an attempt is made to shutdown all subsequent services. After service stop - the AM would proceed and delete the staging directory.\nA really bad case is if there was an error talking to the RM during the unregister. The client has already been told that the job is successful - the RM would have no idea, and the AM would eventually delete the staging directory and exit.\n\nDeleting the staging directory just before the RMCommunicator is stopped would be a much simpler change. It would however have the same problem in case of a failed unregister. Subsequent services do not matter.\n\nThe HistoryEventHandler had a similar race - where the AM was being shutdown before the history handler was stopped. That was fixed by ensuring the history service was registered after the container allocator - so that it shuts down first.\n\nHandling the situation where the client thinks the job is successful, and the RM has no idea about the job seems like a separate Jira. Some way to have the RM pick up the state of the job if and when it restarts the next AM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-10T01:45:19.116+0000","updated":"2012-04-10T01:45:19.116+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12549329/comment/13250684","id":"13250684","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Agreed, we can still get into a bad situation if the AM cannot communicate with the RM after informing the client.
