Hence killing all the maps will take \n{{5min * num-maps-on-tracker/num-reducers}} in the best case and {{5min * num-maps-on-tracker}} in the worst case assuming default config. \nFollowing are some of the tweaks \n1) Keep track of the total failures registered against the tracker (per job) and kill all the maps for a job if the total failures for a job is greater than 25% .\n2) Keep a set of unique hosts per job that have registered against a blacklisted tracker and kill all the maps for a job if all the reducers have complained against the blacklisted tracker. \nCurrently we do similar stuff for killing a map based on fetch failures. We should do something similar in case of trackers i.e re-schedule all the maps (per job maybe) in case of blacklisted trackers. In future we may relax the condition of the tracker being blacklisted.

We should probably step back and look at the model of killing a map based on fetch failure notifications. Today, we do killing of maps based on fetch failure notifications on a per map basis and we wait for a majority of the reducers to tell the JobTracker about the fetch failing for a particular map. \nWith the random ordering of map output fetches and the backoff per failed fetch, this might take a long time per map. This is what you observed Runping, IMO.\nInstead we probably should include the tracker name on which map ran in the logic for killing a map - if we get too many fetch failure notifications for maps that ran on a particular tracker, which we will detect much faster, we should probably kill those maps that ran on that tracker, for which we are seeing fetch failure notifications. That will take care of the case where only the jetty is faulty (the tracker is not blacklisted as it could, and probably still can, execute tasks).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2008-03-26T20:57:25.597+0000","updated":"2008-03-26T20:57:25.597+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12382138/comment/12585446","id":"12585446","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Needs further investigation.
