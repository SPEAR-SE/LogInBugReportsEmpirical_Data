After investigating this issue in the context of MAPREDUCE-5110 and otherwise, I strongly believe that MAPREDUCE-2217 was the wrong way of handling things. IMO, it is more a hack than a good solution. \n\nA better approach would be for the TT to monitor the progress of tasks including those that haven't been launched yet (per-job config: mapred.task.launch.timeout) and kill those that are past the timeout. The JT realizes this and launches another attempt. In case the TT itself expires, the task yet to be launched also gets expired along with other running tasks. We have tested this fix on production clusters and it works significantly better than the one on MAPREDUCE-2217.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-05T20:42:03.612+0000","updated":"2014-05-05T20:42:03.612+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12712404/comment/13989984","id":"13989984","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"repro-mr-5877 helps reproduce the issue.
