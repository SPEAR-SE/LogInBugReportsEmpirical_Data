Then check that each heartbeat will schedule one task-cleanup task which need only one slot. So it need't to create dummy tracker status with FAILED_UNCLEAN tasks.\n    The result of the change in MAPREDUCE-2207 is that task-cleanup tasks can't be scheduled to trackers with FAILED_UNCLEAN tasks to report during heartbeat, no matter the task failed on which tracker. This cause none task-cleanup task will be scheduled during heartbeat in the test case.
