With this patch, CapacityTaskScheduler assigns multiple tasks in a single heartbeat. It assigns multiple maps just like the default scheduler - multiple local tasks and at-most one off-switch tasks; and multiple reduces. It also keeps track of the tasks decided to be assigned in a particular scheduling iteration so as that high memory jobs are blocked for scheduling and user-limits are respected while giving away multiple tasks.\n\nThe patch also has test-cases.

incorporated HADOOP-538 also to ensure jobs at the head of the queue do not aggressively grab tasks hurting locality for others.\n## The implementation tracks 'number of scheduling opportunities' missed by a job and gets jobs to use that to prevent starvation.\n## I've also added 'pace' to the back-off by getting ensuring jobs do not back-off as aggressively as they make progress.\n## The patch also gets small jobs to back off less vis-a-vis larger jobs by ensuring the backoff considers the #maps in the jobs.\n## The patch also ensures jobs with no locality e.g. sleep-job/randomwriter
