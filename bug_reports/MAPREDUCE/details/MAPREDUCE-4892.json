So this change mainly boils down to effects on single mapper wave jobs or small jobs.\nThat's not true, locality affects large jobs too. Unless your definition of large means read less and process for a long time.\n\nbq. In these cases, it is arguable that having a few rack local mappers (which significantly increases the on time start of the mapper) might be beneficial than having the mapper wait on a machine because it was node local to it. Likeliness of waiting is high since the machine has many mappers already assigned to it.\nThat's a general argument against node locality itself, one that is take care of by other mechanisms like locality-wait/delay.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-29T20:51:50.304+0000","updated":"2013-01-29T20:51:50.304+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624700/comment/13566182","id":"13566182","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I meant unnecessary computations for nodes that are not going to produce more splits in every iteration. The code will try to group any remaining blocks and fail to produce a meaningful split. And it will do this again and again.\n\nIn the example, we could end up generating 5, 1, 3 or 4, 1, 4 splits by trying to be completely node local. Or we could go 3, 1, 3 and 2 rack-local. Upon scheduling the rack-local option would start 3, 3, 3 if there are 3 slots per node. The extra node local ones would have to wait  for nodes 1 and 3 to finish the first wave before they can run. Or wait for delay scheduling to kick in and get scheduled on node 2. Which of these will be faster is not obvious.\n\nIn any case, we can debate this endlessly. I have attached an alternative patch which iterates multiple times over nodes until it all blocks have been grouped or no node if left with more than minsize of blocks, while trying to keep number of iterations low.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-30T05:31:19.944+0000","updated":"2013-01-30T05:31:19.944+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12624700/comment/13566218","id":"13566218","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
