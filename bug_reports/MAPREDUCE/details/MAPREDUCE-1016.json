If Avro incompatibly changed it's schema format then we'd probably change it to \"Avro2-json\" or somesuch.  We'd need to change the version string if we changed the schema in some critical way that's impossible to detect by examining the schema itself, but I have a hard time imagining a change like that, and we could always instead, e.g., change the name or package of the top-level class in the schema to make such a change easy to detect.  So it's unlikely but not impossible that we'll need to change the version string, and, if we do, we can append a version number to it.  The version string already future-proofs us sufficiently.\n\n> Also, what is your opinion on whether job-history format would be fixed on a specific encoder permanently?\n\nNothing's permanent.  It seems possible we someday might want to permit binary too, so I added the encoding to the version string.  But for now I think the proposal is to be json-only.\n\nWhat seem more probable to me is that we might someday use a standard container format like TFile or Avro's data file.  These can be differentiated by use of \"magic\": Avro data file always begins with 'AVR\\0', the json file always begins with \"Avro-Json\\n\", etc.  So it's good that the file begins with a fixed string rather than just the schema, but exactly what string it begins with is less critical.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-07T18:02:26.334+0000","updated":"2009-10-07T18:02:26.334+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436251/comment/12763420","id":"12763420","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hong.tang","name":"hong.tang","key":"hong.tang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I'd like to propose the following that may make it easier toward future extension without requiring too much special case code to support backward compatibility.\n\nLine 1: The version string.

The point of the change to the log format was to make it trivial for external tools to process these logs.  We don't want to make folks have to write a header processor.  Most folks will probably just skip the first two lines and use a json parser.  If they want to do some error-checking, they can check that the first line is \"Avro-Json\".  Further, if they want, they can read the schema and use Avro.  If we permit arbitrary headers then folks have to skip up until a blank line, which harder, although not much.  But if they want to check the format or use Avro then they have to write a header parser, and logic to process the header, which I think is an unneeded imposition.\n\nThe magic signature for this format is \"Avro-Json\\n\".  The format is:\n - first line is magic\n - second line is an Avro schema\n - subsequent lines are json-encoded instances of that schema\n\nI see no need for a more complex format at this time.  The only change from the original Json-based format when Avro was added was changing the magic line to not have a version number and adding a line with the schema, which is, in essence, the version number.  If you think we should have a more general, header-based format, please file a separate issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-08T18:38:48.656+0000","updated":"2009-10-08T18:38:48.656+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436251/comment/12766760","id":"12766760","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Here's a new version of this patch that also upgrades to Avro 1.2.0.\n\nIn Avro 1.2, generated classes are no longer all nested within an interface, which mandated a systematic update to references to the generated classes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-16T22:58:26.838+0000","updated":"2009-10-16T22:58:26.838+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436251/comment/12766811","id":"12766811","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
