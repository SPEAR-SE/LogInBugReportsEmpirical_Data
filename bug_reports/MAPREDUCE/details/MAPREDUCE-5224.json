In Azure, the default file system is set as ASV (Windows Azure Blob Storage), but we would still like the system directory to be in DFS, because we don't want to put such files in ASV that charge Azure customers fee. Thus, we want to change JobTracker.java to allow that.\n\nThe problem in the current JobTracker.java is that we want to use makeQualified() to assemble a path. But getSystemDir() uses the wrong fs object to call fs.makeQualified(), if default (e.g. Azure in our scanerio) and \"mapred.system.dir\" are using different file systems. In the proposed fix, we rely on FileSystem.get() to choose the appropriate file system according to \"mapred.system.dir\". It falls back on the default file system if the scheme is not there. \n\nAlthough the original motivation is trying to fix the problem for Azure, this fix also applies to other scenarios where the default file system and \"mapred.system.dir\" are supposed to use different file systems.\n\nA unit test will follow.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xifang","name":"xifang","key":"xifang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273"},"displayName":"Xi Fang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-10T01:33:21.296+0000","updated":"2013-05-10T01:33:21.296+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646671/comment/13656644","id":"13656644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xifang","name":"xifang","key":"xifang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273"},"displayName":"Xi Fang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I updated the patch. It includes the unit test. I also made some change to MAPREDUCE-5224.patch because the previous one is not complete. In many places, the default file system is used to access the system directory rather than only in getSystemDir(). Thus, this requires much more changes to the original code. \n\nI still have some questions I am not quite sure.\n1. In the constructor of JobTracker:\ntry {\nFileStatus systemDirStatus = systemDirFs.getFileStatus(systemDir);\nif (!systemDirStatus.isOwnedByUser(\nmrOwner.getShortUserName(), mrOwner.getGroupNames()))\n{ throw new AccessControlException(\"The systemdir \" + systemDir + \" is not owned by \" + mrOwner.getShortUserName()); }\nif (!systemDirStatus.getPermission().equals(SYSTEM_DIR_PERMISSION))\n{ LOG.warn(\"Incorrect permissions on \" + systemDir + \". Setting it to \" + SYSTEM_DIR_PERMISSION); systemDirFs.setPermission(systemDir,new FsPermission(SYSTEM_DIR_PERMISSION)); }\n} \nBasically, I have changed the file system used to access the system dir.

I think this is close, have some comments below which should be easy to address. \n\n1. JobTracker.java: Lines should not exceed 80 chars per Hadoop coding guidelines.\n{code}\nFSDataOutputStream out = FileSystem.create(systemDirFs, tmpRestartFile, filePerm);\n{code}\nSame comment for other changes in the patch.\n\n2. I really don't think it is necessary to introduce IOException to so many methods and interfaces for the reasons in this Jira. I would change JobTracker#getSystemDir() to fallback to the default value and log a warning in case {{FileSystem.get()}} throws.\n\n3. Should JobTracker#RecoveryManager#checkAndAddJob() use systemDirFs?\n\n4. I would rename the {{JobTracker#fs}} local member to {{defaultFs}} to signify its meaning and avoid possible confusion in the future. I actually don’t think you need to keep both defaultFs and systemDirFs as members. The only other place where you need defaultFs is {{JobHistory#initDone}} and you should be able to query for it locally. \n\n5. Let's rename the test to TestJobTrackerWithNonDefaultFS\n\n6. What is the expected behavior for TestSysDirOnNonDefaultFS when your code changes are not applied? Looks like the setUp step is failing. I would prefer if we could have the test case fail instead. \n\n7. TestSysDirOnNonDefaultFS.java: Please add a more verbose comment on the intent of the test.\n{code}\n/**\n * Class to test jobtracker's system dir\n */\n{code}\n\n8. TestSysDirOnNonDefaultFS.java: Why not let setUp throw the IOException() in case of an error?\n\n9. TestSysDirOnNonDefaultFS.java: Please use JUnit assertEquals method to validate that the expected and the retrieved values are equal.\n\n10. TestSysDirOnNonDefaultFS.java: Can we also add validation that mapred system dir is created in the right place by checking for its existence. \n\n11. Would be good to understand if there are some changes needed to get the equivalent functionality in YARN.

For comment #2: I personally think it would be better if we can throw out an exception rather than swallowing it and setting it back to default file system. As mentioned by Mostafa (offline),  for example, if someone configured the system dir as http://www.awesome.com/system, then with the fallback solution the exception saying \"HTTP is not supported\" will be swallowed and we'll set the system directory as just /system in the default file system, which doesn't seem like good behavior. We may want someone explicitly know/handle this at the moment  this happens.\nc. For comment #4: I renamed the JobTracker#fs to defaultFs and still keep it just for possible future use/reference of this variable. \nd. For comment #6, 8: I put the initialization of MiniDFSCluster, MiniMRCluster in the test case and let setUp() just construct a configuration.

A few additional comments below. Once you address those, +1 from me\n\n1. You'll have to impersonate the MR owner when you're querying for the systemDirFs (same routine as with defaultFs). Sorry, I missed this when I initially reviewed the patch.\nAfter:\n{code}\n        if (defaultFs == null) {\n          defaultFs = mrOwner.doAs(new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileSystem>() {\n            public FileSystem run() throws IOException {\n              return FileSystem.get(conf);\n          }});\n        }\n{code}\nadd the following:\n{code}\n\n        if (systemDirFs == null) {\n          systemDirFs = mrOwner.doAs(new PrivilegedExceptionAction<FileSystem>() {\n            public FileSystem run() throws IOException {\n              Path sysDir = new Path(conf.get(\"mapred.system.dir\",\n                \"/tmp/hadoop/mapred/system\"));\n              return FileSystem.get(sysDir.toUri(), conf);\n          }});\n        }\n{code}\n\nOnce you implement above you should be able to simplify getSystemDir() by assuming that systemDirFs is different than null. This will allow you to get rid of the IOException (#2 comment from my initial review).\n\n2. Nit: JobTracker.java: It seems that a tab slipped in:\n{code}\n      if (systemDirFs.exists(restartFile)) {\n    \tsystemDirFs.delete(tmpRestartFile, false); // delete the tmp file\n      } else if (systemDirFs.exists(tmpRestartFile)) {\n{code}\nI also see some invalid indentation:\n{code}\n        // disable recovery if this is a restart\n          shouldRecover = false;\n{code}\nPlease correct.\n\n3. Please remove try/catch from TestJobTrackerWithNonDefaultFS#tearDown since it can possibly mask a problem. Instead you can add IOException to the throws clause of the method:\n{code}\npublic void tearDown() throws IOException {\n{code}\n\n4. TestJobTrackerwithNonDefaultFs#testSystemDir: No need for the try/catch block in the test, please remove. The test will fail if any of its asserts fail.\n\n5. Can you also please change TestJobTrackerWithNonDefaultFS#MAPRED_SYS_DIR to the following:\n{code}\n  private final String MAPRED_SYS_DIR =\n      System.getProperty(\"test.build.data\", \"/tmp\") + \"/mapred/system\";\n{code}\nGuideline is for all local test files to go under test.build.data folder.\n\n6. Nit: TestJobTrackerwithNonDefaultFs: You can use assertTrue instead:\n{code}\n    assertEquals(\"Check if the system dir exists \", \n        FileSystem.get(sysDirPathURL, conf).exists(sysDirPath), true);\n{code}\nBtw, when you’re using assertEquals, you should place the expected value as the first arg, and the test value as the second arg. For example, assertEquals(true, fs.get().exists()).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-05-23T21:11:10.704+0000","updated":"2013-05-23T21:11:10.704+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12646671/comment/13665679","id":"13665679","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=xifang","name":"xifang","key":"xifang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=xifang&avatarId=17273"},"displayName":"Xi Fang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Ivan for your detailed comments.
