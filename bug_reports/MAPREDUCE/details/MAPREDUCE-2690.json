I think Ramya specifically wanted the queue bar. Can you please check with her?\n\nRamya, what do you think about this one?\n\n\n> 3.Alignment of text is broken (should be centre)\nDone.\n\n\n>4.Queue State is 'unknown' -> should be RUNNING/STOPPED\nThis value is coming from getQueueState() method. It was 'unknown' because the FifoScheduler() constructor was not initializing the queue state. I added a fix to this in FifoScheduler.java and it is working now.\n\n\n> 5.Showing queue capacity is not useful with a single queue i.e drop max/total/current capacity\nDone.\n\n\n> Also, is there some unit tests we can add?\nI updated the following test:\norg/apache/hadoop/yarn/server/resourcemanager/webapp/TestRMWebApp.java\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-09-08T21:12:36.792+0000","updated":"2011-09-08T21:12:36.792+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514265/comment/13100705","id":"13100705","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sounds good, I'll commit once hudson +1s the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-08T21:17:12.055+0000","updated":"2011-09-08T21:17:12.055+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514265/comment/13100718","id":"13100718","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
