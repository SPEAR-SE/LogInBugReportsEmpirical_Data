Here's what I think is really useful. Start the existing MockRM object with AdminService started, create and rewrite the host-file in the test, decommission a node via refreshNodes() and then validate that the node is decomissioned?\n - Also, we can add one more test to verify that the Node indeed goes down when it gets the Decommission command from RM. Start a NodeManager, mock the heartbeat and send a Decommission command and verify that the NM stops.\n\nThanks for taking this up!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-12T05:10:58.928+0000","updated":"2011-10-12T05:10:58.928+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12517862/comment/13126596","id":"13126596","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Vinod for looking into the patch.\n\nI have updated the patch by incorporating the changes for the above comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-13T14:06:15.602+0000","updated":"2011-10-13T14:06:15.602+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12517862/comment/13126611","id":"13126611","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

We can generalize it.\n\n{quote}\nNeed to send a SHUTDOWN command to the nodes even if it is invalid at the RM at the time of registration. This is a very common case, we exclude the node even before we start the cluster.\nPlease also add a test for the above.{quote}\nIt is already shutting down if it is excluded node by throwing IOException. This can be done by sending the shutdown command as part of RegisterNodeManagerResponse instead of IOException. \n\n\n{quote}\nIf the node is not valid, the correct component to send a RMNodeEventType.DECOMMISSION event to RMNode is NodeListManager. We can move this code out of ResourceTrackerService into NodeListManager.refreshNodes() - sending events to all nodes that get decomissioned during refreshNodes(). This will also ensure that the decomissioned-node-count gets incremented immediately instead of waiting for all the nodes to reach RM. Your tests in TestResourceTrackerService also simplify a bit.\n{quote}\nI agree with Aruns comments on this, and in this case, we either need to establish a new communication between RM and NM other than heartbeat for generating events.\n\n{quote}\n\nTestNodeStatusUpdater: The two second sleeps are error prone. I think it should simply wait till heartBeatID becomes more than 3 or a timeout\nSimilarly in TestNMExpiry, you should spin around till lost-nodes' count becomes two or a timeout happens.\nTestResourceTrackerService is good work! \ncheckDecommissionedNMCount(): Again spin till the correct count or a timeout occurs.\n{quote} \n\nYes, I will address this problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-24T06:09:00.649+0000","updated":"2011-10-24T06:09:00.649+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12517862/comment/13134933","id":"13134933","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I have updated the patch as per the above comments.
