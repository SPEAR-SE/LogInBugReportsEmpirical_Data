I did look for alternatives before I created my big regular expression.\n\nThe big problem is that Java doesn't really present any API that distinguishes numeric IP addresses from symbolic addresses.  Although InetAddress.getByName(String) must have some means of parsing an IPV4 and IPV6 literal numeric address, this functionality is not presented to java.net.* users.  InetAddress.getByName(String) will parse either a numeric address or a symbolic name and produce indistinguishable results.  That piece of the API does not give us a means to distinguish the two.  I was unable to find any other API that did make the distinction.\n\nThe formats of numeric literal IPV4 and IPV6 internet addresses are fixed in RFCs and are extremely unlikely to be changed in the foreseeable future.  We are therefore not exposed to any non-future-proofing.  The only exposure we have is a possible future IPV8, but the ICANN is doing its best to make that unnecessary for a very long time.\n\nConsidering that Apache already owns this regular expression we should consider using it.\n\nI considered the simpler approach of considering any address that contains a colon character to be a numeric IPV6 address, but colons are used as other punctuation, ie., separation between IP address and port number.  That solution felt to me to be too brittle and accident-prone, and doesn't solve the IPV8 problem.  There is a continuum of IPV6 solutions ranging from \"look for a colon\" to the correct regular expression you see here, and no principled way to decide where to stop.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-01T00:28:44.788+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T00:28:44.788+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441194/comment/12783971","id":"12783971","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hong.tang","name":"hong.tang","key":"hong.tang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@dick, thanks for the comments. I am combing through the jdk code too and struggling to find the any explicit API. Finally, I found out that there are calls to directly translate ipv4/6 addresses from string literal form ot Inet{4|6}Address objects, but they are not in JDK, instead they are in sun.net.util.IPAddressUtil - which makes it unusable (unless we mandate everybody use sun jvm).\n\nWhat bothers me for re-implementing RFC 2372 (IPv6 address architecture) is that it is a complicated scheme and we probably need a suite of unit-tests to guarantee our implementation is correct - which sounds to me to be way beyond the scope of this jira (which should not even exist if HDFS-778 is fixed).\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hong.tang","name":"hong.tang","key":"hong.tang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-01T00:44:49.006+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T00:44:49.006+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12441194/comment/12789032","id":"12789032","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hong.tang","name":"hong.tang","key":"hong.tang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Ok, I did a bit research, and (with some help from Hairong) found out that the numeric ip string is obtained by NN when a DN registers itself with NN through o.a.h.ipc.Server.getRemoteIAddress(), which in turn calls InetAddress.getHostAddress() to get the string representation of the ip address.
