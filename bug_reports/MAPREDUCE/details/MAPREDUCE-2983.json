Could we make this an easier experience for new users by having the MR AM double check that the ShuffleService is configured at application submission time? \nThis is a hack irrespective of whether we do this in the AM or the client.\n\nUnfortunately even that is insufficient. Shuffle service is a configured auxiliary service on the NodeManagers. Auxiliary services are designed to be, well, auxiliary. For e.g. you can imagine only a subset of the cluster to have mapreduce ShuffleService and the rest not to have it. So, the correct way to do this is make the AM request containers on nodes which have the specified auxiliary service configured, basically this should be part of container-requests.
