Because of this there is no guarantee that a scheduler will have a root queue, or something like that, so it because very difficult to write something generic with JMX that can cover all cases.\n\nInstead I would like to add in some APIs to YarnScheduler to get back the information we want.  It may get the information from metrics if it feels like it.  This is also very similar to what MAPREDUCE-2789 appears to need, but on a per application basis instead of on an aggregate basis for the entire cluster.\n\nAlso we could add in some APIs on a per node basis so the node manager GUI can get back to where it was before and display resources used, reserved, etc.  I will talk with the owner of MAPREDUCE-2789 about potentially filing a separate JIRA to do this work on.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-20T16:18:47.059+0000","updated":"2011-09-20T16:18:47.059+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515562/comment/13108830","id":"13108830","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Adding in the base issue I just filed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-20T17:06:30.635+0000","updated":"2011-09-20T17:06:30.635+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515562/comment/13119342","id":"13119342","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This patch adds in two new, small tables at the top of several pages on the RM.  The first table is always there and shows the stats for the cluster Total Apps Submitted, Total Containers Running, Total Memory in the cluster, Memory used, Memory reserved, Total NMs, Blacklisted NM, and Excluded NMs.\n\nThe NMs are links to lists of NMs in that state.  The nodes page was updated to support filtering by a given state.\n\nAlso if user level metrics are enabled in the scheduler, and web Authentication is enabled then a second table showing stats for the current user is shown.  It includes (just for this user) Apps submitted, containers running, containers pending, containers reserved, memory used, memory pending, memory reserved.\n\nI did not add in a link to the jobhistory server, because that is map/reduce specific.  If this is a blocker then I will add in a new config option for yarn which will be a list of links to various servers that display UIs related to this and add them in of the left hand nav bar.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-03T14:53:17.803+0000","updated":"2011-10-03T14:53:17.803+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515562/comment/13119355","id":"13119355","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

Looks mostly good!\n\nSome suggestions for mostly cosmetic changes:\n - I'd prefer 'good' and 'removed' nodes as the main categories. If that is okay, we can use the same in the URL path-names instead of bl, ex. Better and full-forms are easy to remember and pass around. Same in the Titles and corresponding variable names for the corresponding pages.\n - Can we also print NodeState on the NodesPage? Definitely helps for the all-nodes case, also distinguishes the type of a removed node - LOST vs DECOMMISIONED.\n\nAlso ran it on a single node. Looks clean except for two minor things - (1) the titles of the new table are bolder than the other main-table - say apps-list and (2) it may be good to have some gap between the metrics-table and the main-table for each of this pages. Please see if these are doable, if it is too convoluted we can skip for now.\n\nThanks for taking this up! I am the biggest beneficiary in the short term, when I run benchmarks and lots of jobs :)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-04T14:29:22.140+0000","updated":"2011-10-04T14:29:22.140+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515562/comment/13120180","id":"13120180","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I can change it to good and removed, but that is not what was listed previously in the web UI.
