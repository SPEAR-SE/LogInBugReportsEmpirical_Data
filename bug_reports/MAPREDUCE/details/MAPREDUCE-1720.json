With browser search, one can also lookup the ID on a single page, without having to switch any context for the resultant state (be it tab or page). But yes, the representation could use a little work as the pages tend to get longer and longer over load/time.\n\nAbout job history/details, since the current job details page gets pretty large thanks to counters and charts, it wouldn't look good even if it were expanded inline, I think.
