However - the absolute progress rate of the speculated tasks is not bad at all (most of the speculated tasks had a progress rate that would have taken them to 100% within 3-4 minutes). \n\nOne heuristic that seemed obvious after looking at this was that we should have a upper bound on the progress rate - where above that progress rate - speculation does not make sense (regardless of mean/stddev). The proposal is to be able to configure this as a 'minimum_duration' setting on mappers/reducers. if the mapper/reducer is projected to finish within this duration - no speculation will be done. setting the duration to a small number like 3-4 minutes would weed out a lot of excessive speculators.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-09-14T00:09:57.813+0000","updated":"2010-09-14T00:09:57.813+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12473889/comment/14080247","id":"14080247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Spec exec got majorly overhauled.
