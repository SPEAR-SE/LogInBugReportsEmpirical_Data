It starts to make the table very crowded and busy and it already is too overcrowded for my taste.  I would much rather have something visual then have a huge table with all of this information in it, but that is probably a ways off.  Perhaps we could look at adding in something to show/hide columns so we don't need to see everything, and if someone wants to dig deeper into an issue they can add in more columns. Alternatively I would not mind having an analyze this job link like in 1.0, at least until something better can be determined.\n\nI also noticed that there appears to be a bug in the history server.  It is reporting the task start time to be the same as the job start time (or at least the time that the task was initialized by the AM).  In both 1.x and in the AM the task start time is the start time of the first task attempt.  We need to file a JIRA for this too or else your new time is always going to be the same as the column right next to it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-08T17:50:36.837+0000","updated":"2012-10-08T17:50:36.837+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610627/comment/13472490","id":"13472490","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Bobby! I agree with you. The table already was, and I've made it more, crowded. I am going to be working on adding more intuitive visual representations of the job progress. Graphs and all. My vision is that the table will only serve as a repository to look up all the raw data about job start and finish times. If you want to let this JIRA stay uncommitted until I add in the visual representation, I'm fine with that.\n\nLike Jason already pointed out in our discussion, hiding/showing coloumns will result in \"column hell\" (I believe he can be credited with coining this term ;-) ) where URLs shared between users might not incorporate the information about which columns are being shown and which are hidden. We could incorporate that into the URL, but I'm guessing there are better ways to present the information. We could also avoid printing the date for jobs which finish on the same day as they started. Like you suggested, we can address that in a separate JIRA.\n\nAn \"Analyze the job\" link in my mind would incorporate something like Vaidya so I'm wary of adding it right now.\n\nI'll file the JIRA to fix the start time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-09T15:54:21.935+0000","updated":"2012-10-09T15:54:21.935+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12610627/comment/13472493","id":"13472493","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"My main purpose in filing this JIRA was to present ALL the information that was available in branch-1 in the web UI of 0.23.
