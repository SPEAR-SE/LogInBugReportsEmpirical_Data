That is, if a file is only appended since it was copied last time, only new data need to be copied. \n\nThis improvement was done before HDFS truncate feature (HDFS-3107) was implemented. Since we support truncate, if a large file is truncated a little bit, the whole file will still need to be copied, even with the solution of MAPREDUCE-5899.\n\nCreating this jira to improve the situation, by possibly remembering the smallest truncated size, so there is chance to only append from that size on.\n\nHDFS tasks\n* Add field *minTruncateLength* to *FileWithSnapshotFeature*, default to file size.\n* Whenever a file is truncated, update the field.\n* Pass the field to HDFS client in MODIFY entry of *SnapshotDiffReport*.\n* When a snapshot is deleted, minTruncateLenght(s+1) = min(minTruncateLenght(s+1), minTruncateLenght(s))\n\nCopyMapper tasks\n* If *minTruncateLength* < *target_file_length*, CopyMapper should perform a *truncate(target_file_length - minTruncateLength)* operation.\n* If *minTruncateLength* < *source_file_length*, CopyMapper should perform an *append(source_file_length - minTruncateLength)* operation.\n\nIn some cases, CopyMapper may perform a *truncate* followed by an *append*.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Improved incremental data copy of distcp for truncated file","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12921747/comment/15056577","id":"15056577","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yzhangal","name":"yzhangal","key":"yzhangal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yongjun Zhang","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This idea is based on in person discussion with John, and he will be taking a further look, so I assigned to him.
