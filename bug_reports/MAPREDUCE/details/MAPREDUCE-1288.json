I was just trying to point out that such a case may not even be valid in the context of how MAPREDUCE-856 was approached (i.e we wanted to secure localized files for users). But I am concurring that one could theoretically construct a case where the URI was accessible to a group of users on DFS and since there's no way to securely localize that per group on the TT, this bug is still valid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-11T06:53:35.916+0000","updated":"2009-12-11T06:53:35.916+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443043/comment/12789153","id":"12789153","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"All I am saying is that irrespective of the file being public or not, in the current codebase, we localize the file exactly once per TaskTracker.

This is the scenario:\n1. There is a file \"/a/b/c/1.txt\" on the hdfs which is private (one of the directories in the path leading up to the hdfs file does not have EXECUTE permissions for OTHERS).\n2. A user \"foo\" uses this file in his job as a DistributedCache file, and the TTs localizes this file in a location owned by user \"foo\" (since this file is private it lands up in the protected place).\n3. A second user \"bar\" also tries to use the same file in his job. Both users belong to the same unix group.\n4. Assume some TT that localized \"/a/b/c/1.txt\" file before, while running foo's task, got a task of bar's job. It concludes the file was already localized since the mapping has an entry for /a/b/c/1.txt (mapping refers to the mapping between the Cache URIs and the CacheStatus objects, maintained by TT). \n5. The TT doesn't localize this file again. It instead points the tasks to the file that was localized in step (2). Since the directory where the file was localized is not readable by anyone other than \"foo\", the tasks of \"bar\"'s job fails.\n\nI guess earlier this issue didn't arise earlier (pre-security) since the distributed cache files, even if they were private, were getting localized in directories that were readable by all users.\n\nAttaching a patch for Y20S that addresses the issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2010-07-27T02:12:00.144+0000","updated":"2010-07-27T02:12:00.144+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443043/comment/12892610","id":"12892610","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Attaching the correct patch..","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2010-07-27T02:15:34.875+0000","updated":"2010-07-27T02:15:34.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443043/comment/12892724","id":"12892724","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Devaraj, this corner case is exactly what Hemanth was trying to explain earlier on this ticket, starting with comment #4 above :)\n\nAs for the approach, we have two options:\n (1) (this seems to be what the patch is doing) for group shared files, localize them separately for each user.
