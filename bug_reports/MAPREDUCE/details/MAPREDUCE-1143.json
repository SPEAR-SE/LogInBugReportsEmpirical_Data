For instance, even after this patch, I see that the number of running tasks is decremented under different checks when a task completes and when a task fails. I assume this is for good reason, but still it is difficult to review.\n\nSo, the different checks are as follows:\n\n{code}\ncompletedTask() {\n  if (this tip is complete) {\n    return;\n  }\n  update counters\n}\n\nfailedTask() {\n  if (any attempt was running for this tip before status update) {\n    update counters\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nIt appears completedTask doesn't need the check for TIP being complete at all, as it can never happen. A tip is marked complete only if atleast one attempt has completed and  remains so. If another attempt comes in reporting success now, we fail this in status update and do not follow the completedTask code path at all. So, for all practical purposes, counters are being updated unconditionally in completedTask. Further, in the same code path, the task is removed from the active tasks as well. Hence no further check is necessary.\n\nThe check in failedTask is required though. This is because a task can fail *after* it has been marked as succeeded. For e.g. if there are fetch failures for a map, or if a tracker is lost. In this case, we should not update counters again because they would have already been updated when the task succeeded.\n\nHowever, in this context, I am a little worried that we are checking for any attempt being running before status update, rather than this specific attempt. At least in theory it is possible this results in some inconsistency.\n\nConsider this sequence of events:\n- A task is scheduled\n- It is speculated\n- It completes -> Counters are decremented here.\n- It fails (lost TT, fetch failures) -> The current patch will decrement counters here again.\n- The speculated attempt succeeds.\n\nIn practice though, this scenario may not be very likely. Apparently fetch failures and lost TTs are the only extreme cases when this is possible. And there is considerable time lag that can happen before a task completes and it has to be failed. The time lag will in most cases be large enough to kill the speculative attempt as well.\n\nWith this background, is it worth changing the current patch to:\n\n{code}\nfailedTask() {\n  if (this task was running before status update) {\n    update counters\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nThis seems more correct to me, but was wondering if it was worth the change.

Rather than looking at this as a way of the TIP calling into the JIP to update counters, I started thinking about this as the TIP deciding what has changed in its state and informing about the change to the JIP. Then JIP decides to update its state (basically the counters) based on this information. This is a really good separation of ownership.\n\nHowever, Arun, Rahul and I looked into making this change into the current code base and fell out of confidence with respect to the level of change it was causing. Given this point, we now feel that my original suggestion [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1143?focusedCommentId=12784077&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12784077], while agreeably not as good as Owen's, is a *safer* and more localized change to implement than the alternate proposal. And we suggest taking that approach to fix this JIRA.\n\nA rewrite of this status update code is really long overdue, and it would anyway be done in the manner Owen is proposing, but in a separate JIRA.
