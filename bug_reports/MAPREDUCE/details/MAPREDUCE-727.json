Are you proposing we replace them with hadoop_streaming style parameters\n\nYes - the idea here is that a lot of jobs duplicate a lot of common driver code. The point here is to avoid having to write a main() at all - not currently possible with hadoop jar. Obviously this interface isn't for everyone, but might feel more familiar for some.\n\nbq. we will have 1:1 correspondence between those switches and config knobs anyway\n\nYea, and I think this is long term something we should work on. There are some other JIRAs floating around about the configuration framework - we should perhaps keep in mind the idea of a \"flag style name\" for some configuration parameters. This is probably unrelated to this particular JIRA trhough - sorry for taking us off-topic.\n\nWhat would the new functionality for mapred job -submit do, exactly? Does anyone make use of the current job -submit interface? Writing an xml jobconf is a big enough pain I don't know of anyone doing it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-11-11T22:57:54.856+0000","updated":"2009-11-11T22:57:54.856+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429757/comment/14072163","id":"14072163","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"I'm going to close this as fixed.  mapred job -submit did come about and hadoop jar is still there in 2.x for backward compatibility.  yarn jar was added and is probably preferable in most cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-07-23T19:05:27.727+0000","updated":"2014-07-23T19:05:27.727+0000"}],"maxResults":11,"total":11,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-727/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jedj:"}}
