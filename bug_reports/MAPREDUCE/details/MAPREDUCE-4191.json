The AM however is doing the setup and clean tasks where as in mrv1 it would need to allocate a slot for those.  The AM may have fixed overhead but that overhead is configurable. I could create an AM with 24G of memory or use the default of 1.5G. Or on the flip side, I have an AM that uses 1.5G, but have a map task that now gets scheduled and uses 24G which puts it way over its capacity.  That could affect the queue current usage greatly and seems to break the capacity guarantee. \n\nIn the case where you say have 2 jobs in the queue, you have 2 app masters, one of which is \"counted' against your queue and then the other one is not.\n\nI do see it beneficial to queues with very small capacities though, as without this they could be stuck without enough resources to run a task.\n\nArun or anyone else familiar with capacity scheduler, if you could provide explanation that would be great.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-04-26T17:54:36.947+0000","updated":"2012-04-26T17:54:36.947+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12552168/comment/14607073","id":"14607073","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Moving bugs out of previously closed releases into the next minor release 2.8.0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-06-30T04:36:46.850+0000","updated":"2015-06-30T04:36:46.850+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-4191/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0e5r3:"}}
