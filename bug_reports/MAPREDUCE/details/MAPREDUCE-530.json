When one of them starts running and its maps occupies the whole cluster, submit a high-memory job with the number of tasks equal to the cluster-capacity. After this job gets submitted, submit 2 more normal jobs. \n  Problem found:\n  When maps of the 2 normal jobs finished, the maps of high-memory job were scheduled and not the reduces of normal second job. Reduces of the second job were blocked for want of memory till the maps of high-memory job were finished.\n\n - Test II:\n  Submit a high-memory job with number of tasks equal to the cluster-capacity. When this job starts running, submit 3 normal jobs.\n Problem found:\n   Maps of high-memory jobs were scheduled and when the maps got finished, the maps of other jobs started getting scheduled instead of the reduces of high-memory jobs. Also though the other jobs were normal, their maps were also not scheduled totally, instead only in one wave. After one wave, reduce scheduler took over and no task from any job was scheduled till the tasks of normal jobs started finishing, thus making the scheduling of tasks hard to predict.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-05-12T09:42:55.511+0000","updated":"2009-05-12T09:42:55.511+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-530/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ix1j:"}}
