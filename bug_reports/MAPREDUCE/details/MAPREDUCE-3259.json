Kihwal, won't it suffice to have the right configs (and defaults) for admin.env?\nFor executing the task script, that's true.  For LTC directly launching JVM to run localizer, either LD_LIBRARY_PATH or -Djava.library.path is need to be set properly. It will appear to work until something requiring the native lib is enabled. When I enabled the JNI-based user groups mapping feature, the localizer wouldn't run.\n\nBack to running task script. The task jvm may have to load libhadoop.so because of a certain cluster-level config. I think we should treat it as an app-level dependency, rather than a run-time dependency of specific client code. Sometimes even admins won't know whether the library will be required by enabling a feature. I thought it will be simpler to add java.library.path to take care of the dependency at the app-level.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-26T21:39:39.137+0000","updated":"2011-10-26T21:39:39.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528650/comment/13136619","id":"13136619","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Kihwal, sorry if I wasn't clear.\n\nIf the admins set mapreduce.admin.user.env such that LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes paths for libhadoop.so and JNI-based user-groups mapping, what goes wrong?\n\nmapreduce.admin.user.env is for cluster-level configs (libhadoop, user-groups mapping etc.) and app-specific deps can go in mapreduce.(map,reduce).env.

I shouldn't have said app-level. That's totally wrong. \n\nApps are fine as you said. It's about yarn system level env. When a JVM is directly launched by the LTC, neither of LD_LIBRARY_PATH or java.library.path is set. This is the case for ContainerLocalizer. It will fail to load libhadoop.so if it needs it. If the library is installed in one of the directories ld looks at, it will work without the setting. Or the hadoop lib path may be added to /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d.  Is it still confusing?  Or am I totally wrong about this? \n\nI can leave out the second part in the patch for the client since a proper env can be placed in the container script using the facility you mentioned. Only thing I don't like is the default, which assumes the old dir layout.  I could try changing the default so that it has a better chance of working right out of the box, but that's not critical.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kihwal","name":"kihwal","key":"kihwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kihwal&avatarId=34594"},"displayName":"Kihwal Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-10-27T00:35:06.515+0000","updated":"2011-10-27T00:35:06.515+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528650/comment/13136869","id":"13136869","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ok, the talk about apps confused me.
