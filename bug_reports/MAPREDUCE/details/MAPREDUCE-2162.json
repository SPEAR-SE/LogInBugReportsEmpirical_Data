It's much easier for users/admins to understand speculation decisions that can be explained in terms of potential latency savings. It's also easier to build cost models (latency reduction, cpu cycles saved) based on run time (as opposed to progress rates).\n\n- if in future #rows processed are available - then they can be accomodated - One can normalize the task duration with the number of rows and use that instead of the raw duration time.\n\n---\n\nAssuming we use task durations - we still need to decide on a speculation criteria. There are couple of criteria that already in place (for us):\n- don't speculate tasks for first LAG seconds\n- don't speculate tasks that are projected (based on progress rate) to complete in N seconds (MAPREDUCE-2062)\n\nOne other negative criteria is obvious. Assume we are dealing with a task with projected remaining time _R_ (using progress rate), total time _T_ where the job's average task duration is _M_:\n\n- if _R_ < _M_ - then it makes no sense to speculate (the logic being that if we relaunch the task - it can be expected to take around _M_ seconds. So the current task will outrun the speculative attempt).\n- if _T_ is in 'normal' range - then also it doesn't make sense to speculate. we need to define normal.\n\ni am not sure that normal is best measured by mean + stddev. The reason is that tasks are frequently multi-modal in their durations (for example we are joining data sets a, b, c - mapper splits from a b and c will have different run times (depending on compression, size of row, filter condition etc.). ideally we should track mean duration per data set - but we don't have that available. the mean and stddev don't mean much in these conditions.\n\nSo my suggestion is to define normal to be in terms of percentiles. If a tasks total duration (projected) is within some N % (say 90) - then we should exclude it from speculation. if a task stalls  - it will eventually show up in the top percentile and be speculated. we can also supplement percentiles with absolute numbers (if a more than M tasks are slower than the task being considered - just don't speculate it)\n\n----\n\nelmination is great - but could still leave us with always trying to speculate slowest 10% (for example) of tasks. that's a lot for a busy cluster. at this point i think we should look at the cost/benefit of choosing some K slowest tasks (by remaining time) to speculate.\n\nThe benefit of speculating a task is limited to the latency difference with the next slowest task. As an example: if the three slowest tasks had remaining time of  100s, 200s and 201s - then speculating only the last one will produce hardly any gain (1s !!!) - but speculating the last two can give us 101s gain (best case). The complication here is that one needs to consider the cost/benefit of speculating some K tasks at a time (and not one at a time).\n\none simple way of specifying this may be to consider speculation opportunities that result in at least X% or Y seconds decrease in latency. this needs some more thinking.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-10-29T19:05:34.480+0000","updated":"2010-10-29T19:05:34.480+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12478526/comment/12927559","id":"12927559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This sounds pretty good, Joydeep. Just wanted to make one comment: even if we use, say, then 90th percentile to determine the \"normal\" range for tasks, it may not mean that we'll speculate 10% of tasks all the time. The reason for this is the other speculation criteria -- speculative lag and R < M. In particular, if we let each task run for some amount of time (say half the average task length) before deciding on whether to speculate it, then it's likely that even for many of these 90th percentile tasks, R will be less than M so we will not want to speculate. This might be enough to get a good speculation algorithm (that only speculates a few percent of the tasks and almost always picks ones that will beat their original tasks) without having to do the cost-benefit estimation at first.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-11-02T19:25:22.475+0000","updated":"2010-11-02T19:25:22.475+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12478526/comment/12927729","id":"12927729","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"agree in general although i would need to collect some data to see how any particular scheme would turn out.  if we just shifted to percentiles, we could do it in terms of progress rates as well.\n\n> if we let each task run for some amount of time (say half the average task length) \n\nseems like a good one to add to the list. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-11-03T03:58:31.800+0000","updated":"2010-11-03T03:58:31.800+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12478526/comment/12965624","id":"12965624","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"spent a lot of time coding and thinking about this. i am more to make a simple change to cap the standardDeviation at some maximum value (say Mean/3).\n\ni did a detailed analysis that seems to suggest that doing so would be roughly equivalent to the scheme discussed above. we already have the notion of a 'speculative cap' - putting a speculative cap of 10% of the currently running tasks would be roughly equivalent of speculating the bottom 10%.
