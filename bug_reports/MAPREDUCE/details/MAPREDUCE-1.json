Any thoughts ? \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=enis","name":"enis","key":"enis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Enis Soztutar","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2007-07-09T12:51:07.099+0000","updated":"2007-07-09T12:51:07.099+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372190/comment/12511255","id":"12511255","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\nPatch for HADOOP-1547 makes Aggregate work.\nUse this issue for the general feature for allowing the user to specify jar files \na job depends on.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=runping","name":"runping","key":"runping","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Runping Qi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-07-09T21:05:26.729+0000","updated":"2007-07-09T21:05:26.729+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12372190/comment/12741719","id":"12741719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think the issue is nothign to do with shipping the jar.
