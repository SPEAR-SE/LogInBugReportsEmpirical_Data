A task attempt is started.\n2. A speculative task attempt for the same task is started.\n3. The speculative task attempt completes and causes the task to transition to SUCCEEDED.\n4. The initial task attempt fails and causes the task to transition to SCHEDULED.\n\nNo more task attempts are scheduled so the job never completes. I have written a unit test to demonstrate this, which fails.\n\nThe situation occurs because TaskEventType.T_ATTEMPT_FAILED can cause a task to transition from the SUCCEEDED state (see attached state diagram). This type is caused by one of:\n\n* FailedTransition - when a task attempt fails \n* DeallocateContainerTransition - when a task attempt goes from assigned/unassigned to killed/failed\n* TooManyFetchFailureTransition - when a reducer fails to get the map output\n\nOnly the last one seems like a good reason to transition a task from a previously SUCCEEDED state. The first two should leave a task in the SUCCEEDED state, and the third should be handled with a new type (T_ATTEMPT_FAILED_RETROSPECTIVELY or T_ATTEMPT_TOO_MANY_FETCH_FAILURE) which transitions to SCHEDULED (or FAILED).\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2012-05-12T04:42:54.656+0000","updated":"2012-05-12T04:42:54.656+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12555002/comment/13274165","id":"13274165","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"Here's a patch that implements the suggested change in my previous comment.

This is similar to the pattern for MapRetroActiveFailureTransition(). So the fix is a simple downward movement of the check for TaskType.\n\nThe check for whether the task is MAP should still be there (and is also there for MapRetroActiveFailureTransition()) because after a REDUCE has completed with SUCCEEDED there is no reason to fail it because its outputs are already preserved in HDFS. So any attempt to fail it would be a bug in the code.\n\nWe could also potentially improve the check of a successful attempt in MapRetroActiveKilledTransition() by using the condition in MapRetroActiveFailureTransition().\n\nI opened YARN-61 to track this. Currently assigned to me because I wrote MapRetroactiveKilledTransition.
