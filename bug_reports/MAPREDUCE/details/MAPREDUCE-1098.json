Effectively there is a 1-1 mapping between between files on HDFS and their localized counterparts.\n\nI'm thinking a slightly different solution to the problem exhibited by this patch is to break the 1-1 mapping between files on HDFS and the localized files and get the CacheStatus objects to own the unique localized paths. The proposal is to have a unique CacheStatus.localLoadPath per object and to initialize them via copies from HDFS from src files to unique localized files. Thus we can then continue to keep the current (correct) structure for deleteCache and put smarts in getLocalCache to copy on init of CacheStatus.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-22T10:14:04.550+0000","updated":"2009-10-22T10:14:04.550+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12435290/comment/12768627","id":"12768627","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Illustrative patch for my earlier comments...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-22T10:15:54.253+0000","updated":"2009-10-22T10:15:54.253+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12435290/comment/12768731","id":"12768731","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Arun, this may not work as well.\n\nBasically, the localization code is like this:\n\n{code}\nsynchronized (cachedArchives) {\n  get lcacheStatus\n  synchronized (lcacheStatus) {\n    increment reference count\n  }\n}\nsynchronized (lcacheStatus) {\n  localize cache\n}\n{code}\n\nThe delete cache code is like this:\n\n{code}\nsynchronized (cachedArchives) {\n  for each lcacheStatus {\n    synchronized (lcacheStatus) {\n      if (lcacheStatus.refCount == 0) {\n        //\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nThe problem is when iterating to delete, if a localizing thread is localizing a cache file for a particular cache object, the delete thread will wait to acquire the lock on the cache object *after* acquiring the global lock. Since the localization could take a long time, other threads will be blocked, in effect not solving the problem we trying to.\n\nDoes this make sense ?\n\nIt seems like a very correct approach should *not* require to lock any object when doing a costly operation like a DFS download. Other threads should wait for a download complete event notification, or some such. But those are sweeping changes. \n\nOne solution Amarsri and I discussed was to see if making the reference count an AtomicInteger would help. Then maybe, its value can be read without having to acquire a lock on the cache status object. So, the delete code will be something like this:\n\n{code}\nsynchronized (cachedArchives) {\n  for each lcacheStatus {\n    if (lcacheStatus.atomicReferenceCount.get() == 0) {\n      synchronized (lcacheStatus) {\n        // continue operation as in your patch.\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nSince we are guaranteed that code that's localizing a path will have the reference count as non-zero, it will never try and proceed to the delete operation.\n\nCould this work ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-10-22T15:59:56.318+0000","updated":"2009-10-22T15:59:56.318+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12435290/comment/12768735","id":"12768735","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Oh, sure.
