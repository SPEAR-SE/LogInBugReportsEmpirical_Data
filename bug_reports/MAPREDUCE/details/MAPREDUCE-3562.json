But then what is the harm with synchronizing it?  From a defensive programming standpoint I would rather see it synchronized because it is simple to do, and could potentially prevent an error from happening in the future if someone uses the API incorrectly.\n\n@Ravi\n\n # The patch needs to be upmerged the Counters part no longer applies.  \n # Inside JobControl getWaitingJobList, getRunningJobList, and getReadyJobsList really don't need to be synchronized because getJobsIn is already synchronized.  \n # Inside JobControl the synchronized statement in toList is unnecessary, and should be removed to clean things up.\n # I am a bit confused about the synchronization changes made to Counter.  CounterStrings.toEscapedCompactString appears to already handle the synchronization properly, although it is hidden in there.  I don't see why these changes are needed.\n # Also there appear to be a lot more threading issues in Counters, but I haven't had time to dig into it that deeply to be sure.  The big one I see is a potential deadlock in Counters.Counter.equals, which seems odd, because there appears to be no other synchronization anywhere else in that class, but I have not dug that deeply into its parent class which probably has some synchronization in it. Did you run into actual problems while running Hadoop or are these just from inspecting the code?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-05-30T21:01:00.256+0000","updated":"2012-05-30T21:01:00.256+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12535259/comment/13286290","id":"13286290","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.
