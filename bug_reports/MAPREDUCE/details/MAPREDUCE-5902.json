It appears that at least some characters, if in a job name, will make the jobhistoryserver skip recognition of a completed jhist file.\n\n*Regarding logging*\nIt would be extremely useful , then, to have a couple of gaurded logs at this level of the code, so that we can see, in the log folders, why files are being filtered out  , i.e. it is due to filterint or visibility.\n\n{noformat}\n\n  private static List<FileStatus> scanDirectory(Path path, FileContext fc,\n      PathFilter pathFilter) throws IOException {\n    path = fc.makeQualified(path);\n    List<FileStatus> jhStatusList = new ArrayList<FileStatus>();\n    RemoteIterator<FileStatus> fileStatusIter = fc.listStatus(path);\n    while (fileStatusIter.hasNext()) {\n      FileStatus fileStatus = fileStatusIter.next();\n      Path filePath = fileStatus.getPath();\n      if (fileStatus.isFile() && pathFilter.accept(filePath)) {\n        jhStatusList.add(fileStatus);\n      }\n    }\n    return jhStatusList;\n  }\n\n{noformat}\n\n*Reproducing* \n\nI was able to reproduce this bug by writing a custom mapreduce job with a job name, which contained % characters.  I have also seen this with a version of the Mahout ParallelALSFactorizationJob, which includes \"-\" characters in its name, which wind up getting replaced by \"%2D\" later on at some stage in the job pipeline.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"1h","remainingEstimate":"1h","originalEstimateSeconds":3600,"remainingEstimateSeconds":3600},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":3600,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"394610","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JobHistoryServer (HistoryFileManager) needs more debug logs, fails to pick up jobs with % characters in the name.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jayunit100","name":"jayunit100","key":"jayunit100","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577"},"displayName":"jay vyas","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jayunit100","name":"jayunit100","key":"jayunit100","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577"},"displayName":"jay vyas","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":3600,"percent":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":3600,"percent":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12716260/comment/14006775","id":"14006775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jayunit100","name":"jayunit100","key":"jayunit100","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=jayunit100&avatarId=19577"},"displayName":"jay vyas","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"FYI, i categorized this as a bug because, without debug logs -
