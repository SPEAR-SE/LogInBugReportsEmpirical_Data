A new configuration property yarn.nodemanger.disk-health-checker.interval-ms is added for the frequency with which this code is executed, with a default value of 120*1000ms(i.e. 2minutes).\n\n(2) LocalStorage is a new class that manages a list of local file system directories and provides api for checking the health of those directories (mostly similar to TaskTracker.LocalStorgae class of 0.20 except that this class' checkDirs() doesn't throw DiskErrorException when all directories fail but returns true if a new disk-failure is seen.\n\n(3) DiskHealthCheckerService maintains 2 LocalStorage objects ---- one for nm-local-dirs and second one for nm-log-dirs.\n\n(4) ContainerExecutor is initialized with the DiskHealthCheckerService object. So both DefaultContainerExecutor.java and LinuxContainerExecutor.java get good nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs from the DiskHealthChecker always.\n\n(5) container-executor binary gets good nm-local-dirs and good nm-log-dirs as a parameter and uses these good dirs only. So these are removed from the configuration file(i.e. not needed to be configured in container-executor.cfg configuration file).\n\n(6) Whenever a new container gets launched, the good nm-local-dirs and good nm-log-dirs are updated in the configuration sothat containers won't access bad disks. Everybody (localizer, webserver) goes through DiskHealthChecker to access nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs.\n\n(7) On the NodeManager web UI, NodeHealthReport will be showing the lost of good nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs in addition to true/false about the health of the node.\n\n(8) A new unit test TestDiskFailures is added that makes disks(both nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs) fail and checks/validates if the NodeManager/DiskHealthChecker can identifies these disk-failures or not.\n\n\\\\\nTested the patch with (1) DefaultContainerExecutor and (2) LinuxContainerExecutor on my single node cluster. The functionality seems to be working fine with disk failures getting identified by NodeManager and the bad nm-local-dirs and bad nm-log-dirs getting avoided for new containers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ravidotg","name":"ravidotg","key":"ravidotg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Gummadi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-11-04T09:46:03.662+0000","updated":"2011-11-04T09:46:03.662+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525190/comment/13143877","id":"13143877","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comprehensive summary, Ravi!

A couple of points I saw - will go through the patch in more detail later. \n\n1. I believe the return in ContainersLaunch#handle when no good disks are available requires a ContainerExitedWithFailure event to be triggered for the container state machine to handle the failure and clean up appropriately. When you do this, I think in the cleanup case, we need to add a null check on rContainerDatum. Please add appropriate test cases to see that the container state machine works correctly if all disks have failed.\n\n2. A general comment about the handling of passing around of the diskchecker object or calling of the getLocalDirs()/getLogDirs() functions. Given that there is a timer task involved that will be updating the values in the background, there may various inconsistencies which may crop up based on when the functions are called. \n\nFor example, in the Linux Executor, the final command being constructed uses 2 calls: \n   - checker.getLocalDirsString()\n   - checker.getLocalPaths()\n\nThere could be modifications done during the time that elapses between the 2 calls that may create issues. Also, now the executor also needs to check if there is atleast one good disk available.\n\nIMO, one approach we could take is to do a check at the top level. For example, ContainersLaunch as per the patch does a sanity check on available disks and bails if there is an issue. It could create a snapshot of available disks at this point \nand pass them to the ContainerLaunch which in turn will pass them on to the executor's launch container call. This will also probably help in simplifying the code in that the low level components no longer need to be worried about checking if there are any good disks available.\n\n\n\n\n\n \n\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-11-04T21:45:45.300+0000","updated":"2011-11-04T21:45:45.300+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525190/comment/13146099","id":"13146099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"My comments on the patch.\n----\n*Major:*\nDiskHealthCheckerService\n - Let us not use the configuration property to read the dir-list anywhere. I already see a couple of places where this can be trouble-some. Make sure that YarnConfiguration.NM_LOCAL_DIRS and YarnConfiguration.NM_LOG_DIRS aren't read anywhere after the initial NM-start.\n   -- After this, you should definitely drop DiskHealthCheckerService.updateDirsInConfiguration().\n - ResourceLocalizationService.localDirsSelector doesn't look at healthy disks, same for ShuffleHandler.\n - Let's have a single API to return local-dirs either Array or a list. Let the caller take care of any conversions they need. Ditto about getLocalDirsString()/getLogDirsString().\n - Same as above for the LocalStorage class and getNumDirs() methods in there.\n - Instead of setting the disksInfo in NodePage, we can set it directly in the health-report via NodeStatusUpdater. That way, RM will also get the report.\n\nbq. IMO, one approach we could take is to do a check at the top level. For example, ContainersLaunch as per the patch does a sanity check on available disks and bails if there is an issue. It could create a snapshot of available disks at this point.\nAgreed, we should check at ContainersLauncherImpl level before launching every container and send out a container-failed event in case all disks have gone bad.\n----\n*Minor:*\nDiskHealthCheckerService\n - DisksHealthMonitorExecutor can be static and final.\n - Drop the constructor DiskHealthCheckerService(Configuration conf) and use init() life-cycle directly.\n - init(Configuration conf): call super.init() at the end so that it can set the service-state correctly. Same for start(), stop()\n - Declare diskHealthChecker as a DisksHealthMonitorExecutor instead of TimerTask so as to avoid unnecessary casting in get{Log|Local}Dirs()\n - LocalStorage is way too general. Let's rename LocalStorage to LocalDirectories?\n\nLet's have multiple local and log-dirs by default in MiniYarnCluster.\n\nTestDiskFailures:\n - No need for hard-coded 2 secs sleep, MiniYarnCluster already has code to wait for starting.\n - waitForDiskHealthCheck() is error-prone. You can set an inline DiskHealthChecker and invoke explicit checking of disks.\n----\n*Miscellaneous:*\nLike I summarized in my first comment, there are more pending items. Let me know if you want to tackle them separately:\n - We need a configuration for the max-percentage of disks that can fail without shutting down NM.\n - If all or a major percentage of disks turn bad at startup, NodeManager should either fail to start or get started, and report the RM that it is bad and needs operator intervention.\n - If all or a major percentage of disks turn bad during runtime, NodeManager can update the RM and ask for a halt in the scheduling.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-11-08T06:11:59.087+0000","updated":"2011-11-08T06:11:59.087+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525190/comment/13146639","id":"13146639","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nroberts","name":"nroberts","key":"nroberts","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nathan Roberts","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Took a look at the patch and current comments.

Worth mentioning this in the docs.\n\nI think it would make more sense to name the classes LocalDir* instead of Disk* since we're checking local dirs and not disks. For example, we only check the given dirs so if there's a failure on another sector of the disk it won't notice. The NM won't handle boot disk failures even if it detects a failure on a dir hosted on the boot disk because it's dir-centric (ie doesn't know that the disk has failed, just that a dir has). Similarly the local dirs and log dirs may of course reside on the same disk so if we were checking disks we wouldn't need to check them independently. The DN calls this \"volume checking\" for the same rationale, something similar here would make sense as well. I'd call it LocalDirChecker and have it live in common next to LocalDirAllocator. This way HDFS could re-use the code.\n\n5% seems pretty low. How did you arrive at that?

The current MR code (both in 0.23 and 0.20.205) does not distinguish why a task failed, could be a disk failure on a node or IO error. So the client will see it as a failure. We could later sometime do optimizations to be smart about disk failures (saying a task failure on a node with disk failure doesnt count against max num failures) but I think it might have diminishing returns in production environments. Want to open a jira to track it?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-11-27T21:26:56.003+0000","updated":"2011-11-27T21:26:56.003+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12525190/comment/13158034","id":"13158034","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
