The {{LinuxTaskController}} will send a new opcode {{TaskCommands.QUIT_TASK_JVM}} to the {{task-controller}} module; this sends the {{SIGQUIT}} signal itself to the client.\n\nThe existing behavior of {{TaskController.destroyTaskJVM()}} is to send {{SIGTERM}}, sleep for {{context.sleeptimeBeforeSigkill}} and then send {{SIGKILL}}; I've modified this method so that it goes SIGQUIT/sleep/SIGTERM/sleep/SIGKILL. The sleep is necessary after the SIGQUIT to give the task time to actually do the stack dump before it has to handle SIGTERM.\n\nI tested this by running some jobs which time out and verified that they got the stack dumps in their task stdout logs; jobs which succeed do not. I did this with both the DefaultTaskController and the LinuxTaskController. I also added a unit test to the patch which checks that evidence of a stack dump appears in the stdout log for a task which is killed by the unit test.\n\nWhile I was in the {{task-controller}} c++ module, I discovered a segfault which is also fixed in this patch. If {{HADOOP_CONF_DIR}} isn't defined, it expects {{argv[0]}} to be the full path to {{task-controller}} so it can find the {{conf}} dir based on this. If you just run {{./task-controller}}, this will try to malloc a negative amount of space. I changed it to gracefully exit with an error message in this case. (Simple fix; no unit test case.)\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-23T20:28:57.200+0000","updated":"2009-10-23T20:28:57.200+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12769421","id":"12769421","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

Use the same constant (sleepTimeBeforeSigkill) as already exists.\n* ProcessTree and DefaultTaskController both contain a lot of redundant code clones; if people are okay with it, I'm +1 on condensing a lot of the logic. The initial version of this patch didn't modify anything extraneous, but since the earlier versions of this patch make its intent clear, I'll write a broader one that cleans up the other code \"in the neighborhood.\"\n* I'll rename the current logic in {{finishTask()}} to {{sendSignal()}}; we can preserve a method named {{finishTask()}} that specifically sends SIGKILL using {{sendSignal()}}\n\n\n| This currently causes stack traces for all killed tasks, right? I don't personally have a problem with that, but the description of the JIRA indicates that only those due to failing to report status will dump their stack, and it's worth noting the difference.\n\nI've tried tracing backwards through the code to figure out what triggers JVM kills, but it's a lengthy string of methods involved. What other operations are there (besides task timeout) which wind up killing the task? The {{TaskController.destroyTaskJVM()}} method is only called from {{JvmManager.kill()}}, which itself receives no information as to why it's killing the JVM in question. (There are no arguments to this method; there's no flag in there to determine that the jvm under management has experienced a timeout.)\n\nI actually claim that actually receiving a SIGKILL implies that something has gone wrong in the process. Tasks that clean up \"politely\" do not get the SIGKILL, and thus also do not get the SIGQUIT/dump stacks.  So if something's gone wrong, then in my mind, we should capture the stack trace for debug purposes.\n\nOtherwise, we will need to modify the JvmManager API to be more precise about the nature of kills. I suppose I could live with that, but someone else needs to point me to where the information about this lives. So this would add complexity, and in my mind, be less useful.\n\n* As for sigQuitProcessGroup(), I modeled the logic in dumpTaskStack() after that of all the other signalling methods. It's conceivable that a user's task process hangs because it spawns subprocesses and then gets in a deadlock based on IPC between the task and its subprocesses. I think the better question is: Is there a good reason *not* to send SIGQUIT to the entire child process group? (e.g., substantial overhead, especially that which blocks the TT?) I don't think there's any more overhead here on the TT's side than sending SIGTERM to the process group, which we already do. If we maintain this same logical structure in dumpTaskStack as we do in killTask, etc, then we can refactor this code down into a considerably more condensed form involving better code sharing. Otherwise, dumpTaskStack will have to remain a special case.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-10T00:12:02.396+0000","updated":"2009-11-10T00:12:02.396+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12775958","id":"12775958","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> receiving a SIGKILL implies that something has gone wrong in the process.\n\nHow are speculatively executed tasks terminated?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-10T17:48:47.311+0000","updated":"2009-11-10T17:48:47.311+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12775995","id":"12775995","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Touche.\n\nDoes the jobtracker send information to the tasktracker, though, informing it of whether it is a timeout-based kill or simply a redundant speculative task attempt?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-10T18:36:32.384+0000","updated":"2009-11-10T18:36:32.384+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12776003","id":"12776003","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Actually, I suppose that if it comes from the JT, then it's definitely a speculative task attempt, right?

Results follow:\n\n|*Test case*|*Stack dump?*|\n|set {{mapreduce.task.timeout}} to 10000 (task timeout)|yes|\n|ran {{bin/mapred job -kill-task}} on attempts|no|\n|ran {{bin/mapred job -fail-task}} on attempts|no|\n|Let it complete successfully|no|\n|ran {{bin/mapred job -kill}} on the job itself.|no|\n|threw a RuntimeException in the mapper|no|\n\nThus, I believe that translates into the following for your table:\n\n|*Reason*|*wasFailure*|*generates stack*|\n|Child exception|maybe|maybe*|\n|Other task failures|false|false|\n|Task timeout|true|true|\n|Task killed by user|false|false|\n|Task failed by user|false|false|\n|Job killed by user|false|false|\n\nLooking at {{org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child}}, there are a few different catch blocks in there:\n* If a task throws a {{FSError}}, this triggers {{TaskUmbilicalProtocol.fsError()}}, which will cause a {{purgeTask(tip, wasFailure=true)}}.\n* If a task throws any other sort of {{Exception}}, this does not trigger a particular response to the TUP; The exception string is passed to {{TaskTracker.reportDiagnosticInfo()}}, but this simply logs a string of text and takes no further action.\n* If a map task throws any other {{Throwable}}, this triggers {{TUP.fatalError()}}, which also calls {{purgeTask(tip, wasFailure=true)}}.\n\nBut immediately after these catch blocks, it closes the RPC proxy, shuts down the logging thread, and exits the JVM. So fsError and fatalError *may* cause a stack dump if the TT processes the request fast enough and issues a SIGQUIT in the next few microseconds. But this is racing against the fact that the child task's next action is \"exit immediately.\"\n\nNote that job kill, task timeout, and the task exception cases are all covered in the unit test provided in this patch.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-11T20:52:44.965+0000","updated":"2009-11-11T20:52:44.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12776687","id":"12776687","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Hey Aaron,\n\nThanks for doing the investigation to fill in the table.\n\nThe behavior as you've described it all seems pretty reasonable - I wish the \"maybe\" were \"false\", but it sounds like it does require a pretty significant overhaul of failure tracking throughout the TT/TaskManager/etc, so I'd be inclined to say it's out of scope.\n\nSo, +0.5 from me on the current patch.

Signals are delivered asynchronously. Even if the signal were sent inside of fsError() before its call to purgeTask(), there is an arbitrary amount of time before that is handled by the child program. (Not to mention that purgeTask()'s logic in this patch is 'send SIGQUIT, wait, then SIGKILL' -- so doing the SIGQUIT before purgeTask() does not change the effective serialization.) Furthermore, the act of printing the stack trace to stderr itself takes an arbitrary amount of time. The child program after calling TaskUmbilicalProtocol.fsError() or fatalError() will still immediately exit all threads; there is no guarantee that it will service the signal before terminating naturally.\n\nBased on the logic in org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child, it is unlikely that the purgeTask() associated with TUP.fsError()/fatalError() is actually killing the task; it's probably exiting of its own accord first (otherwise, we'd be seeing the stack dumps since the SIGQUIT is serialized before the SIGKILL as-is). So I don't think this removes any nondeterminism from the equation. If we want child exceptions to *definitely* trigger a stack dump in the event of an exception, then the child should enumerate its own threads, call Thread.getStackTrace() on them, and print them to stderr itself to ensure that this process completes before exiting the JVM, without relying on asynchronous signals.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-13T02:29:11.395+0000","updated":"2009-11-13T02:29:11.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438350/comment/12777347","id":"12777347","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Maybe I misunderstood, but I thought Vinod's suggestion was to \"remove the uncertainty\" by making sure it *never* dumps stack in the case of a child error (ie *only* do so in the case of an unresponsive task).

Given that task-controller should be in {{$HADOOP_HOME/bin/}}, it will do some surgery on the program name to remove \"bin/task-controller\" and add the \"conf\" suffix, giving {{$HADOOP_HOME/conf}}. Unfortunately, this presumes that {{argv[0]}} is the absolute path to {{task-controller}}. If it's not, then this will result in a negative offset being calculated -- and it will attempt to malloc a negative amount of space, which causes a SIGSEGV. This checks that task-controller was invoked with {{argv[0]}} set to the absolute path to task-controller, and not just something like './task-controller'\n\nHadoop may invoke task-controller via its absolute path, but when I was unit testing it, I just ran './task-controller', which was causing it to segfault. This should exit politely instead.\n\nbq. Now that the semantics have changed, I am not very sure we want to use the same configuration property for sleeping after dump-stack. (Thinking aloud..) Do we even need a sleep here? The signalling order is SIGQUIT->SIGTERM->SIGKILL. Will signals be processed in the order of their arrival? If so, then we will not another sleep. If not, we may need a sleep here, but may or may not be driven by the same config item. What do you think?\n\nI'm not honestly sure. I believe that the operating system will raise the signals to the process in order. However, what it means to \"handle\" a signal is ambiguous. It may be the case that the signal handler for SIGQUIT merely sets a flag which tells another thread to print the stack dumps to stdout at some other convenient interval (e.g., during a gc when the world is stopped). So while SIGQUIT may be received by the JVM before SIGTERM, I don't take that as a guarantee that the data will reach stdout when we want it to. So I think the delay is necessary. As for adding a new config item.. maybe wait til someone makes an issue of this? Is there any performance implication here?\n\nbq. Are we sure \"PSPermGen\" will always be there in the dump? Instead how about passing our own TaskController that does custom actions in TaskController.dumpStacks(), simplifying our verification that dump-stack is indeed called?\n\nIn the Sun JVM, the stack dump messages always end with a description of the heap, which includes this key string. I doubt this is standardized; JRockit or another JVM will probably use some other string. Testing with a MockTaskController is probably a good idea here.\n\nbq. The test-time can be more than halved if we set max-map-attempts to one in both the tests via conf.setMaxMapAttempts(1);\n\nGood observation. will do.\n\nbq.

This includes the above code review suggestions. The {{DefaultTaskController}} is tested by adding a subclass of TaskController for testing; this counts the number of times a {{dumpTaskStack()}} call is made, and ensures that it is incremented only during the appropriate jobs. The same strategy is employed for testing {{LinuxTaskController}}; {{ClusterWithLinuxTaskController.MyLinuxTaskController}} now counts SIGQUIT calls as well as any exceptional exit statuses from {{task-controller}} when administering the SIGQUIT to the client. Also improved {{ClusterWithLinuxTaskController}}'s documentation as regards setting up the testcase a bit.\n\nAll of these tests pass on my local machine.
