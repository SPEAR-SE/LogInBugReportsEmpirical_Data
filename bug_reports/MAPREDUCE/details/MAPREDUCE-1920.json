Some that I can think of:\n* mapred-default.xml could enable the completed job store for 1 hr by default. Power users could override this if they need to\n* we could add some code to delay job retiring for some minimum amount of time (10 minutes?)\n* If the JobClient is still connected to the JT when the job finishes, the interaction could be modified to locally-cache a copy of the counters before retiring the job. Then existing references to the Job would have a guaranteed instance of the Counters available.\n* At the very least, {{Job.getCounters()}} needs a javadoc comment that specifies that it may return null.

If mapreduce.jobtracker.retirejobs is set to false, the jobs will never be retired.  \n\nCurrently, JobTracker maintains a retired job cache which holds JobStatus of the retired jobs, but it does not hold counters.
