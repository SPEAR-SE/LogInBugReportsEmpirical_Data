The word-count for e.g. results in ~12 spills (given hdfs block size of 64M). The presence of a combiner exacerbates the problem by piling serialization/deserialization of records too...\n\nSure, jobs can configure io.sort.record.percent, but it's tedious and obscure; we really

If you already have worked on this I don't want to duplicate your effort, but if not, I think it would be a good step towards better average performance\nwithout expert tuning.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-08-08T04:51:07.805+0000","updated":"2009-08-08T04:51:07.805+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413034/comment/12740904","id":"12740904","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I was working on a patch, but got pulled into other things.

Added comments, changed some debug messages to info.\n\nThe fixed-size kvoffsets and kvindices arrays are replaced by per-record allocations into an IntBuffer overlay of the serialization buffer. The logic for the interlaced buffers is fundamentally the same as the existing code. Once the soft limit is reached, collection continues from the free space between the end of the meta and serialization, at an offset proportional to the average record size. This eliminates io.sort.record.percent and should use the space allocated within io.sort.mb more efficiently without configuration or study.\n\nPossibly controversial points:\n* After each record is serialized, there is a zero-length write from collect. This ensures that all the boundaries are checked and that the collection thread blocks when it is out of space. While it would be possible to block in collect, keeping the logic separate was cleaner and should impose no real penalty.\n* Once the soft limit is reached, at least half the free space is left for serialization data, but this makes no similar accommodation for metadata. Occasional, extremely large records may harm concurrency by skewing the average, as the average record size is based on the counters (i.e. the full task duration)\n* Dropped {{final}} on several variables and methods to avoid penalties for auto-generated accessors; also dropped volatile where unnecessary.\n* Suppressed some findbugs warnings. The inconsistent sync warnings should be spurious, as the variables are only referenced in the collection thread. The unreleased lock exception warning appeared without modifying the spill thread, but I moved the check back outside that thread anyway.\n* The TestMapCollection unit test ported to the new API takes longer. The old test runs in near the same duration on my machine, so I suspect this is probably an unrelated delay.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-15T09:33:49.625+0000","updated":"2009-10-15T09:33:49.625+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413034/comment/12766040","id":"12766040","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

I haven't had a chance to go fully through it, given how dense the code is, but here are a few of my initial thoughts:\n\n- In the configuration parameter, there's the text \"Note that this does not imply any chunking of data to the spill.\" - I'm not sure what this is trying to say. I see that you copied it from the old description, but don't think it's very clear - if I don't understand it even with code level familiarity I doubt end users will.\n- Consider writing TestMapCollection as a true unit test rather than submitting jobs to the local cluster; Mockito can probably be helpful here. Or, separate out MapOutputBuffer into a static class (maybe even a new file?) so it's easier to test in isolation without mocking up as much stuff. I tend to prefer static inner classes (or non-inner classes) since their scope is more clearly identifiable, but I understand that's a personal preference.\n- If you do want to submit jobs to the local runner, set Job.COMPLETION_POLL_INTERVAL_KEY (mapreduce.client.completion.pollinterval) to 50ms or so instead of the default. This makes the test 4x faster on my system. You'll have to set this in a Configuration passed into new Job() in the tests, since it uses the cluster config, not the job config (I think this is a bug and I'll open a separate JIRA)\n- suggested test: would be good to have a RecordFactory that generates records of randomized length to truly stress test the system. If we can figure out a test that generates random lengths but has output that's still verifiably correct (in terms of contents and not just total record count) that would be ideal. One possibility is to calculate the product of the checksums of the individual records while generating, and verify that the product remains the same in the reducer. This would guard against a bug like a duplicated record output. If we had this as a separate (not run by default) stress/fuzz test which takes 20 minutes to run and throws all kinds of random data through the system, I think that would be fine.\n\nFor the purpose of continued reviewing (and future documentation) I'd love to see some kind of diagram of the various (I count 9!) pointers into the data buffer. Do you think you could draw something up, or at least write up a sort of mini design doc either in this JIRA or in the code? Just a table of which points delineate what buffers, and what direction they grow in, would be great.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-10-16T23:15:46.860+0000","updated":"2009-10-16T23:15:46.860+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413034/comment/12766802","id":"12766802","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Good ideas; thanks, Todd.\n\nbq.

I'd already made up the diagrams, but anything that helps the analysis and validation would be welcome. I'd rather not add a trace to the committed code, but data from it sounds great.\n\nbq. I ran a simple test where I was running a sort of 10 byte records, and it turned out that the \"optimal\" io.sort.record.percent caused my job to be significantly slower. It was the case then that a small number of large spills actually ran slower than a large number of small spills. Did we ever determine what that issue was? I think we should try to understand why the theory isn't agreeing with observations here.\n\nIIRC those tests used a non-RawComparator, right? Runping reported similar results, where hits to concurrent collection were more expensive than small spills. The current theory is that keeping the map thread unblocked is usually better for performance. Based on this observation, I'm hoping that the spill.percent can also be eliminated at some point in the future, though the performance we're leaving on the table there is probably not as severe and is more difficult to generalize. Microbenchmarks may also not capture the expense of merging many small spills in a busy, shared cluster, where HDFS and other tasks are completing for disk bandwidth. I'll be very interested in metrics from MAPREDUCE-1115, as they would help to flesh out this hypothesis.\n\n----\n\nThe documentation (such as it is) in HADOOP-2919 describes the existing code. The metadata and serialization data are tracked using a set of indices marking the start and end of a spill ({{kvstart}}, {{kvend}}) and the current position ({{kvindex}}) while the serialization data are described by similar markers ({{bufstart}}, {{bufend}}, {{bufindex}}). There are two other indices carried over from the existing design. {{bufmark}} is the position in the serialized record data of the end of the last fully serialized record. {{bufvoid}} is necessary for the RawComparator interface, which requires contiguous ranges for key compares; if a serialized key crosses the end of the buffer, it must be copied to the front to satisfy the aforementioned API spec. All of these are retained; the role of each is largely unchanged.\n\nThe proposed design adds another parameter, the {{equator}} (while {{kvstart}} and {{bufstart}} could be replaced with a single variable similar to {{equator}} the effort seemed misspent). The record serialization moves \"forward\" in the buffer, while the metadata are allocated in 16 byte blocks in the opposite direction. This is illustrated in the following diagram:\n\n!M64-0i.png|thumbnail!\n\nThe role played by kvoffsets and kvindices is preserved; logically, particularly in the spill, each is interpreted in roughly the same way. In the new code, the allocation is not static, but will instead expand with the serialized records. This avoids degenerate cases for combiners and multilevel merges (though not necessarily optimal performance).\n\nSpills are triggered in two conditions: either the soft limit is reached (collection proceeds concurrently with the spill) or a record is large enough to require a spill before it can be written to the buffer (collection is blocked). In the former case is illustrated here:\n\n!M64-1i.png|thumbnail!\n\nThe {{equator}} is moved to an offset proportional to the average record size (caveats [above|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-64?focusedCommentId=12765984&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12765984]), {{kvindex}} is moved off the equator, aligned with the end of the array (int alignment, also so no metadata block will span the end of the array). Collection proceeds again from the equator, growing toward the ends of the spill. Should either run out of space, collection will block until the spill completes. Note that there is no partially written data when the soft limit is reached; it can only be triggered in collect, not in the blocking buffer.\n\nThe other case to consider is when record data are partially written into the collection buffer, but the available space is exhausted:\n\n!M64-2i.png|thumbnail!\n\nHere, the equator is moved to the beginning of the partial record and collection blocks. When the spill completes, the metadata are written off the equator and serialization of the record can continue.\n\nDuring collection, indices are adjusted only when holding a lock. As in the current code, the lock is only obtained in collect when one of the possible conditions for spilling may be satisfied. Since collect does not block, every serialized record performs a zero-length write into the buffer once both the key and value are written. This ensures that all the boundaries are checked and that collection will block if necessary.\n\nThat's about it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-18T07:59:09.642+0000","updated":"2009-10-18T07:59:09.642+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413034/comment/12767693","id":"12767693","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Thanks for those great diagrams - they really helped me understand things much better!

Here are a couple things I think we should cover before committing:\n\n- We don't current run any tests with job.getCompressMapOutput returning true. This caused an issue or two with the shuffle in the past, so we should get at least one test that uses a codec.\n- Since we're using the Local Runner for these tests, it's all a single partition. This is probably OK, since I imagine other tests throughout Hadoop exercise those paths (I'm only looking at coverage from TestMapCollection here)\n- Line 1097 (\"if (bufindex + headbytelen < avail) {\" in void reset()) is always true in our tests.

(Currently kvend and bufend are used in two different context: when there is a spill active or when there is not).\n- Related to the above, adding a variable called spillExists to describe the state when there is a spill buffer.

If bufferRemaining>=0, there is guaranteed space for us to continue write.\n- BlockBuffer is only usable inside MapOutputBuffer, suggest remove the constructor BlockBuffer(OutputStream).\n- Suggest rename BlockBuffer.reset() to BlockBuffer.shiftKeyBuffer().\n- Suggest to add a note to Buffer.write(byte[], int, int) that the checking of bufferRemaining should not be bypassed even if len==0.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hong.tang","name":"hong.tang","key":"hong.tang","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Tang","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-15T05:33:42.861+0000","updated":"2009-12-15T05:33:42.861+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12413034/comment/12793562","id":"12793562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you for the detailed comments, Hong.\n\nbq.

Any particular reason to shut down the thread in Buffer.flush() rather than Buffer.close()?\n\nOnly history. The distinction between flush and close is not clear for a Collector, particularly since one or the other is a noop for map-only/reducer'd jobs. Pulling the MapOutputBuffer into a standalone class could help to refine the distinction. Work such as MAPREDUCE-1211 would clearly benefit; IIRC, the current version of that proposal also pulled out the collector. Filed MAPREDUCE-1324 to track extracting the buffer from MapTask.\n\nbq. I also have a couple of suggestions on refactoring the code to make it more readable [...]\n\nThese are all good suggestions. I thought of the index-based code as inferring high-level abstractions from low-level state, but the {{spillExists}}, {{spillInProgress}} flags distill a lot of esoteric, often redundant calculation into a more understandable format. There's another missing abstraction for setting/querying metadata, which could replace the inline kvmeta manipulations. Since the testing/validation of this patch is difficult, and you've already done the work, I'd like to postpone this to a separate issue if that's OK.\n\nbq.
