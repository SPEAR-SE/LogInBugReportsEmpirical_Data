Carey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I'm glad you filed this.  I was just getting frustrated with this issue myself in the last couple weeks and have various thoughts on the issue.  Some of these ideas are raw and flawed, but  here is what I have been thinking:\n\nIdeally, the framework would limit the classes visible to a job to the minimum required for job execution.  A job could then bring in its own dependencies.  Also, if there was a built-in hadoop dependency hidden by default that a job wanted, it could request access to it.\n\nSimilarly frustrating and related, is how a M/R job has to submit its whole job jar to the cluster each time.  I have a 28MB jar, and a workflow of about 35 dependent M/R jobs (A DAG of them).   Towards the end of this chain, the jobs get smaller and smaller in data size (the end ones are joining, augmenting, transforming and sorting data aggregated by the earlier jobs).  \nTwo big things account for more clock time than the 'heavy lifting' work of the initial 'big data' jobs -- job submission time and scheduling inefficiencies.  The former is related to dependency management.\n\nIf the framework could support installing jars into an 'application' classloader space and then jobs reference that space, task latency could be reduced significantly as each job submission would not need to also submit all its dependency jars.  In my case, the job jar would probably become a couple hundred K instead of almost 30MB -- or even zero K if the jobs could just be stored and called.  TaskTracker nodes could cache these application library spaces to reduce job start-up time.\n\nIn some ways, the dependency management above is like an application server.  Each 'application' has its own classloader space, and there might be several different jobs available in an 'application' -- analogous to several servlets available in a web app.    Like an app server, there will probably be a need for a lib directory that is global, one that is exclusive to the framework, and a per-application space.\n\n\nThere are some questions related to static variables related to such classloader partitioning.  With shared JVM's across tasks, users expect statics to live from one task to another in the same job.  This means the classloader in a JVM corresponds with the Job ID and whether it is a M or R.  Per-Job classloaders could enable JVM recycling across jobs in the distant future because disposing of a Job's classloader will free its static variables.  That in turn leads to the possibility of future reductions in start-up time and per task costs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=scott_carey","name":"scott_carey","key":"scott_carey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Carey","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-04-14T16:58:53.139+0000","updated":"2010-04-14T16:58:53.139+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462010/comment/12857076","id":"12857076","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

This allows folks who want to use OGSi to do so while not impacting others.

For example, URL stream handlers are loaded by the classloader that loaded java.net.URL (boot), or the system classloader. So if a task registered a URL stream handler and it was in the job JAR, then it wouldn't be found since it was loaded by the job classloader, not the system classloader.  In this case, the workaround is to implement a factory and call URL.setURLStreamHandlerFactory().\n* *The caller's current classloader*. For example, java.util.ResourceBundle uses the caller's current classloader, so if the framework tries to load a bundle then the bundle (e.g. a localization bundle) would not be found if it were in the job JAR, since the system classloader (which loaded the framework class) can't see the job classloader's classes. As it happens, MR counters use resource bundles; however, they explicitly use the context classloader, so this problem doesn't occur (see org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.util.ResourceBundles). (Also, I imagine the use of resource bundles to localize counter names in the job JAR is very rare.)\n* *The context classloader*. For example, JAXP uses the context classloader to load the DocumentBuilderFactory specified in a system property. This case is covered by setting the context classloader to be the job classloader for the duration of the task (my latest patch does this). Most APIs that involve classloaders use the context classloader these days.\n\nSo all of these cases can be handled. Also note that by default the job classloader is not used, to enable it you need to set mapreduce.job.isolated.classloader to true for your job.\n\nThe latest patch handles the case of embedded lib and classes directories in the JAR, as well as distributed cache files and archives. The unit test passes (and fails with a NoSuchMethodError due to the class incompatibility if mapreduce.job.isolated.classloader is set to false). So I think it is pretty close now - the main thing left to do is sort out the build for the test, which relies on the MR examples module.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2012-09-18T11:45:41.630+0000","updated":"2012-09-18T11:45:41.630+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12462010/comment/13469203","id":"13469203","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Nice.\n\nWhat I would add is the capability of blacklisting packages.

In our case we would blacklist common/hdfs/yarn/mapred packages and log4j (the factory is a singleton and if present in the job JARs will trash the log configuration of hadoop).

What I would add is the capability of blacklisting packages. \n\nI think that is a good idea. Servlet containers do this - e.g. system classes in Jetty are always loaded from the parent (http://docs.codehaus.org/display/JETTY/Classloading). Rather than failing the job if the class is a system class and is found in the job classpath (as you suggested) I think it would be acceptable to log a warning but load from the system classpath. I expect the default blacklist would be {{java.,javax.,org.apache.commons.logging.,org.apache.log4j.,org.apache.hadoop.}}.\n\nbq. I think we should do the same at YARN level to isolate YARN JARs from AM JARs. Because of this, the JobClassLoader should be in common and probably have a different name, like IsolationClassLoader. \n \nOther YARN apps might benefit from this work, so perhaps we should add the classloader to YARN (not Common, since HDFS shouldn't need it), and the MR-specific parts would stay in MR, of course.\n\nbq. we should see how to enable the classloader on the client side as well as it may be required (to use different JARs) for the submission code. May be as another JIRA. \n\nI think this is a slightly different problem, since users generally have more control over the JVM they submit from than the JVM the task runs in. So, yes, another JIRA would be appropriate.\n\nbq. Also, don't recall now if it is there or not, we may want o have a job config property to disable it in case some app runs into funny issues with it.\n\nAgreed.

For us we have a single thread that is similar to JobImpl executing user code like map/reduce as well as some system logic such as ser-de. Let's say we have a Avro 1.4 jar in CLASSPATH and another Avro 1.7 jar in APP_CLASSPATH. The task's ApplicationClassLoader would then first load Avro 1.7 from CLASSPATH, but then when it needs Avro 1.4 for ser-de it will fail because it has already loaded Avro 1.7 which is backward incompatible.

That way you'll get a bigger audience. Also, this is a resolved JIRA, so I don't think this is the best place to conduct the discussion.\n\nThe thread context classloader is a poor abstraction that's fraught with issues. There is no well-defined contract on how to set and use it. The current hadoop code does pretty much what you're describing above. However, it's difficult to pinpoint always when the user code runs and when the system code runs, so it's bound to be imprecise at some point.\n\nNormally the TCCL is not the main way to load classes. So it would be a problem only if some code explicitly invokes Thread.getContextClassLoader() to retrieve the TCCL and uses it to load classes.
