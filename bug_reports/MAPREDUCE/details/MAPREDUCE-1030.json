Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Some comments, all in test cases:\n- The intent of the test case, testMaxReduceCap, is slightly changed. Previously, we wanted to verify that after hitting the max reduce limit, finishing a map task has no effect. This check is missing.\n- testCapacityTransfer - can check that both maps and reduces are being assigned.\n- testHighMemoryBlockingWithMaxLimit can verify that all tasks are assigned as expected, and not just check for maps or reduces.\n- For the testcase, testUserLimitsForHighMemoryJobs, I think we can make it more readable if we put it in a loop, as it is repeating the same thing. Something like:\n{code}\nfor (int i=0; i<5; i++) {\n  expectedStrings.clear();\n  expectedStrings.put(\n      CapacityTestUtils.MAP, \"attempt_test_0001_m_00000\"+(i+1)+\"_0 on tt1\");\n  expectedStrings.put(\n      CapacityTestUtils.REDUCE, \"attempt_test_0001_r_00000\"+(i+1)+\"_0 on tt1\");\n  checkAssignmentTasks(taskTrackerManager, scheduler, \"tt1\",\n      expectedStrings);\n}\n{code}\nThis will also avoid mistakes like for instance in one of the scenarios here we should be using checkAssignmentTasks but instead we are using checkAssignment\n- In testSchedulingInformation, check for reduce stats being updated after job3 is scheduled.\n- testHighMemoryBlockingAcrossTaskTypes - after the first call to assignTasks, a map and reduce are both scheduled. We should have another call that will now assert that a reduce of the second job is scheduled.\n- testSpeculativeTaskScheduling: The assertion for fjob1.pendingReduces() to be 0 can be moved after the initial call to assignTasks itself with multiple task assignment. Also, we are not checking assignment of speculative reduces. After speculative tasks are handled, we should check that the normal job's reduces are also scheduled.\n- testMultiTaskAssignmentInSingleQueue() is no longer needed, as the same is being tested in many other test cases.\n- testMultiTaskAssignmentInMultipleQueues() needs a javadoc for explaining the test case, and should reuse the new utility APIs like checkAssignmentTasks().\n- checkRunningJobMovementAndCompletion can check multiple assignment.\n- checkAssignment - indentation seems wrong.\n- Since checkAssignment cannot be called if no tasks are returned, the check for tasks == null or empty seems unnecessary. Also, we can simply return the 0th element in the list of tasks.\n- We can rename checkAssignmentTasks to checkMultipleTaskAssignment() to better document intent. This also needs a javadoc. Also, indentation within the method needs some correction. Also, I think we should also check that the number of tasks assigned matches the number expected.\n- TestContainerQueue and TestRefreshOfQueues test classes can be easily modified for checking multiple assignment because of the utility APIs we have. This way, we can actually check reduce assignment for hierarchical queues is working as expected as well.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-10-05T05:27:03.012+0000","updated":"2009-10-05T05:27:03.012+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436404/comment/12762507","id":"12762507","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"- Also, I think we should also check that the number of tasks assigned matches the number expected.\nChecking for size would result in breaking other testcase , as they check for map only or reduce only , even if assignTasks returns both of them.\nIn this patch we are checking to make sure that what ever attempt user is expecting , if that attempt is there in the tasks list.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-10-06T05:10:24.275+0000","updated":"2009-10-06T05:10:24.275+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436404/comment/12762508","id":"12762508","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attached the new patch with hemanth's comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-10-06T05:11:00.872+0000","updated":"2009-10-06T05:11:00.872+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436404/comment/12764478","id":"12764478","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I made a few changes as I was reviewing the last patch by Rahul, and am attaching a new patch with those. \n\nThe changes are mainly in the area of making checkMultipleTaskAssignment to be more strict in checking the tasks expected and returned. In particular, I am now failing the test if a task is scheduled when it should not be. This necessitated that all tasks returned by the scheduler are checked, even for the overloaded method checkAssignment, and correspondingly tests in TestCapacityScheduler needed to be changed so that it uses multiple task assignment checks where appropriate. I remember changing all the user limit tests and testClusterBlockingForLackOfMemory to accomodate this.\n\nOther than this, I verified other changes are fine.
