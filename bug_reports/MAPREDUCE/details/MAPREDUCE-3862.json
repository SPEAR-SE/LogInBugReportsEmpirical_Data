A couple of alternatives:\n\n* Implement a customized ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor that executes all scheduled tasks immediately upon shutdown rather than waiting the specified delays for each scheduled task.  This could still lead to long shutdown times if there are directories scheduled to be deleted with tons of files.\n* Declare the existing behavior \"as-intended\" and note that NMs can take up to {{yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec}} seconds to finish shutting down.
