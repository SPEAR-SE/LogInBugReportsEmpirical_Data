This helps in 2 was\n1) ls on running folder (recovery) is faster with less files\n2) changes in running folder results into FileNotFoundException. \n\n\nSo with existing code, the best way to keep the running folder clean is to note the id's of running job and then move files that are not in this list to the done folder. Note that on an avg there will be 2 files in the history folder namely\n1) job history file\n2) conf file. \n\nWith restart, there might be more than 2 files, mostly the extra conf files. In such a case keep the oldest conf file (based on timestamp) and delete the rest.

Following are the changes\n# jobhistory now maintains an internal mapping from job-id to jobhistory-filename\n# finalize recovery reuses these cached values for renaming\n# jobtracker now invoked jobhistory.markAsCompleted() which moves the job to the done folder. the config files are also moved to the done folder\n# jobhistory's searching api's namely getJobHistoryFilename() and getJobHistoryLogLocation() now expect a boolean indicating if the job is runnning or complete\n# added a check in TestJobHistory to check if the filename returned by the framework after job completion belongs to a done folder or not, files are removed from the running folder. Same is also tested for config files too\n# HistoryCleaner now runs on done folder\n# Made sure that once the job files are moved to done folder, the framework (except historycleaner) is not affected by changes to done folder. History cleaner will fail and re-run upon an IOException. \n\nRunning test-patch\n\nTested this patch on a single node cluster and it works fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-06-11T13:14:12.333+0000","updated":"2009-06-11T13:14:12.333+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12427425/comment/12718704","id":"12718704","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Result of test-patch\n[exec] +1 overall.  \n     [exec] \n     [exec]     +1 @author.
