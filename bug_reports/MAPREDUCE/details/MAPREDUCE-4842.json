Instead of a single list {{inputs}} in {{MergeThread,}} we can keep a FIFO list of these lists.  This will make sure that more than one merge can be pending.  The {{run()}} method in {{MergeThread}} will keep pulling out the map output lists from the FIFO list to merge them(this is a typical producer-consumer scenario.)\n\nI will outline the changes below:\n\nIn {{MergeThread}},\n\n* A {{LinkedList<List<T>>}} type member({{pendingToBeMerged}}) is added and the member {{inputs}} is removed.\n\n* The {{isInProgress()}} method is removed.\n\n* The {{startMerge()}} method will no longer be {{synchronized.}}  It will add the passed list to the tail of {{pendingToBeMerged}} and it will {{notifyAll()}} on the monitor of {{pendingToBeMerged.}}\n\n* The {{run()}} method will sit in a tight loop.  So long as there is an item(list of map outputs) to be consumed, it will consume(merge) the item and remove it from {{pendingToBeMerged.}}  If {pendingToBeMerged}} has no more item, it will {{notifyAll()}} on the object's monitor after setting\n{{inProgress}} to {{false.}}\n\nIn {{MergeManager}},\n\n* All calls to {{isInProgress()}} are removed.\n\n* Unnecessary {{synchronized}} clauses on merge thread objects are removed since the methods where they are in themselves are {{synchronized.}}\n\nI created a patch with the above changes and tested it on my laptop.  The mapreduce tests seem to run without any problem.  However, I do not claim that it is completely tested.  It has to go through the rigorous testing that Jason did.\n\nIf you are interested in taking a look at the patch, I will post it to this Jira.  I welcome your questions and suggestions on the idea of the patch.\n\n-- Asokan\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-12-06T02:56:11.436+0000","updated":"2012-12-06T02:56:11.436+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618634/comment/13512082","id":"13512082","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Jason, do you happen to have a cluster config and job that easily reproduces the problem?

One idea I wanted to try is to change the patch to only trigger a merge after a merge completes if we're convinced there are no outstanding fetchers that would trigger it later (e.g.: only trigger if merge conditions are met and commitMemory == usedMemory, IIRC).\nThat could also prevent a last merge being written to disk - on completion of the last fetcher.

I also implemented the removeFirst() instead of getFirst() change, and I fixed one more issue.  The last patch had a race regarding inProgress where startMerge() could set it to true, but a merge could be completing simultaneously and smash it back to false.  Then we'd run a merge without having inProgress as true during the merge, which is Not Good when it comes to getting the fetchers to try to wait when they should.\n\nThis patch does not implement the pipelining idea yet since the performance tests indicate that it might not be necessary to achieve equivalent performance.  Implementing it should be fairly straightforward.  For example, we could add a volatile mergeCount field that is incremented when merges complete.  waitForMerge() would cache the value in a local on entry and return when either inProgress is false or mergeCount has changed (i.e.: we are waiting for any active merge to complete, not all active merges).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-12-20T17:27:57.434+0000","updated":"2012-12-20T17:27:57.434+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618634/comment/13537181","id":"13537181","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks to all of you for your comments.

I strongly feel that it should be removed.\n* It is still going through premature merge passes before enough map outputs are shuffled to memory resulting in potential performance issue.\n* The patch is more complicated(adding unnecessary new method in the base class and forcing all subclasses to implement it even though this problem exists only for in-memory merger.)\n\nJason Lowe:\n{quote}\nRegarding the removal of the element in the finally block, I'm not sure why we're waiting until after merging...\n{quote}\nThanks for pointing this out.  I realized this and in the new patch I am uploading, I took care of that.\n{quote}\nSpeaking of the finally block, I'm also curious if we really want to only notify others of the merge completing if there are no further merges pending.

However, if we revert the {{finally}} block it may cause the call to {{close()}} to return prematurely even though one more merge is pending.  Any performance gain due to the additional fetches is moot.  First, the pending merge would have used up most of the memory.  Also, the merge is data-dependent.  It may not free up memory sooner.  This will result in stalled map output.\n\nI really appreciate all your comments and the testing.  I will upload the new patch shortly.\n\n-- Asokan\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-12-20T17:31:04.626+0000","updated":"2012-12-20T17:31:04.626+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618634/comment/13537186","id":"13537186","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch race, sorry about that Asokan.

Now that inProgress is being set *after* the input is queued up, we have a different kind of race.  It's unlikely but theoretically possible:\n\n# startMerge() queues up the input and wakes up the merging thread\n# merging thread wakes up, completes the merge quickly, and sets inProgress to false\n# startMerge() finally sets inProgress to true, and now we have inProgress set to true with no merge in progress.\n\nI'd prefer the inProgress setting in startMerge() was moved back to before the input is queued up and the wakeup occurs.  There's still a race where it could blip back to false before it gets set back to true within the run() method, but that's a benign race.  There's always going to be a race regarding inProgress given asynchronous producers and consumer, we just need to make the race outcomes safe.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-12-20T22:44:45.121+0000","updated":"2012-12-20T22:44:45.121+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618634/comment/13537460","id":"13537460","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

This is a tangent to point 1. The mergeFactor is set to the configured value for IntermediateMemoryToMemoryMerger but to Integer.MAX_VALUE for InMemoryMerger and OnDiskMerger. We have to find out the rationale behind these choices.\n\nThanks for all your work on the MergeManager. It is soooooo much cleaner now! Thanks much.\n\nAnyway, since you have been in this area of the code, I was wondering if you could please review MAPREDUCE-3685? The mergeFactor for the OnDiskMerger was wrong. For inMemoryMerger it seems to be correct (because io.sort.factor is defined as \"The number of streams to merge at once while sorting files. This determines the number of open file handles.\"). Besides I wonder if we want to really go into the level of detail of the number of fetched cache lines and not just simplify by assuming constant access to all memory. Please consider continuing the discussion there.\n\nThanks\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-05T23:51:22.574+0000","updated":"2013-03-05T23:51:22.574+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618634/comment/13594248","id":"13594248","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Ravi,\n  Thanks for the compliment.
