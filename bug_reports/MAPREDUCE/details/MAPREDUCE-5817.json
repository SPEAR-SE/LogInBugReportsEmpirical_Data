We found that the job was rescheduling and running a number of mappers beyond the point of reducer completion. In one situation, the job ran for some 9 more hours after all reducers completed!\n\nThis happens because whenever a node transition (to an unusable state) comes into the app master, it just reschedules all mappers that already ran on the node in all cases.\n\nTherefore, if any node transition has a potential to extend the job period. Once this window opens, another node transition can prolong it, and this can happen indefinitely in theory.\n\nIf there is some instability in the pool (unhealthy, etc.) for a duration, then any big job is severely vulnerable to this problem.\n\nIf all reducers have been completed, JobImpl.actOnUnusableNode() should not reschedule mapper tasks. If all reducers are completed, the mapper outputs are no longer needed, and there is no need to reschedule mapper tasks as they would not be consumed anyway.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12329060","id":"12329060","description":"2.8.0

mappers, and (2) modify checkReadyForCommit() so that it transitions to COMMITTING if all reducers are completed (if reducers exist) instead of checking all tasks are completed.\n\nEither approach seems to have some downsides.\n\nFor (1), the change is pretty narrow (only affects the rescheduling scenario). However, it still lets the mapper tasks that were rescheduled prior to reducer completion run. So the job may linger until those mapper tasks run to completion. And if those mapper tasks fail for any reason, it may render the job as failed (even though all reducers may have succeeded in reality).\n\nFor (2), it would be effective and would make the job finish much more quickly. On the other hand, we'd need to do something about the mapper tasks that are running at that point. They may need to be killed. Also, if the original mapper tasks were successful, we may need to \"resurrect\" their status from KILLED to SUCCESSFUL to avoid confusion.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-31T21:40:50.915+0000","updated":"2014-03-31T21:40:50.915+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12705754/comment/13956786","id":"13956786","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I am leaning towards option (1) for its simplicity and smaller impact in general.

Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comments [~bpodgursky]. I've been meaning to revisit this JIRA.\n\nThis JIRA is stalled because there are 2 options to move forward with different implications. Option (1) is to prevent re-running mappers as soon as all reducers complete, and the option (2) is to add a new task attempt state to be able to handle a situation where a node becomes unstable while reducers are past the copy phase.\n\nAs mentioned above, option (1) is narrower and simpler in scope, but it will ensure that the job will complete in time only after all reducers are complete. Option (2) can narrow this window further so that as soon as the we're past the copy phase we can reasonably ensure that the job will complete in time, but at the expense of a fair amount of complexity of the changes.\n\nFYI, our company has been running with option (1) for a while, and we've been more or less happy with that.\n\nI'd like to hear others' thoughts on this. The patch can be updated for the option (1) fairly quickly. It will take more time to complete option (2) on the other hand. We can discuss which option we want to go with, and even going with option (1) first in this JIRA and do option (2) in another JIRA.
