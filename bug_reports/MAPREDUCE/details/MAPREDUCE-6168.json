The problem exists in client side that exception get thrown when getting new counters from server in new version. If we want to fix it in server side, we should have some mechanism to filter the new counter in server side with detecting the version of client. So far from what I know, we don't have versioning differentiation for MR client that make the fix in server side harder. If we are adding some new version detection mechanism here after 2.6.x, then we cannot differentiate previous release versions so Counter filter in server side still cannot work.
