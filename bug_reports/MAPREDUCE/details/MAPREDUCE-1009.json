In case it is needed, shouldn't the target be overridden in capacity-scheduler's build file, rather than putting contrib specific operations in build.xml.\n- The documentation of maximum-capacity in capacity-scheduler's mapred-queues.xml.template seems to have problems. E.g. it says: maximum-capacity-stretch instead of maximum-capacity. Mentions default value as 100. It also talks about sub-queues, but that becomes ambiguous if this is a leaf queue. Same applies for Forrest documentation.\n- Maybe we should specify in the conf template file and the forrest documentation what properties apply for container queues and what don't.\n- In the example (using queues q1 and q2) can we scrub the values of properties to be more clear - like we have capacity set to 0, which is wrong.\n- The link to conf/mapred-queues.xml.template in cluster_setup.xml seems wrong. It is pointing t mapred-queues.xml and not the template.\n- Typo: But the usage of multiple as well as hierarchical queues in actually dependent... -> should be ...hierarchical queues is actually dependent...\n- I think it makes sense to explicitly define what hierarchical queues are somewhere early on when talking about queues. What they are, how they can be used etc. Because we refer to it at multiple places but I don't think the intent is explicitly coming out.\n- Queue refresh is also a scheduler specific supported feature. Should we call that out in the cluster-setup documentation ?\n- I think we need not mention that queue web UI uses YUI. It seems like an implementation detail. Any specific reason for mentioning this ?\n- Shouldn't the Map/Reduce commands section move to the commands manual ? And we can possibly link them from cluster-setup. There seems to be a specific format we are using for describing the commands and it would be consistent to mention it in the same way, which we can easily do by moving to the commands manual.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-10T10:03:41.101+0000","updated":"2009-12-10T10:03:41.101+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12436100/comment/12789258","id":"12789258","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
