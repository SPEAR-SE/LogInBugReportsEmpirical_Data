If yes, obtain a task from the job, as before. If not, determine whether the job has a task to run. Determining this can be performance intensive (it should be similar to _obtainNewMapTask_ or _obtainNewReduceTask_; in fact, we can call the same methods, but pass in a flag that just doesn't update data structures), but we only do it for high mem jobs and where the TT does not have enough memory, so we're no worse off than the normal case. \n# First obtain a task from the job. If a task is returned, then check for mem requirements. If TT does not have enough mem, 'return the task' back to the job. This code to return a task can be complicated, as we need to undo all the data structures we updated in obtaining a task. \n\nOption 1 looks better. I've attached a patch (4981.1.patch) where I add two new methods to _JobInProgress_: _hasNewMapTask_ and _hasNewReduceTask_. Both of these just call the respective _obtainNewXXXTask_, but with a flag which says the call is read-only. I have modified the _obtainNewXXXTask_ to take in the 'readOnly' flag and update data structures and log message only if the flag is false (thanks, Devaraj, for the idea). Only thing I don't like about this patch is the number of if statements that check the flag before logging or updating any data structure. Another option is to refactor the JobInProgress code to separate out the detection of a task from updating data structures, but that seems much more messy. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-01-12T09:08:37.818+0000","updated":"2009-01-12T09:08:37.818+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12411674/comment/12663066","id":"12663066","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Actually, I think we can go ahead and check for a speculative task as if it is a normal execution.

I think the capacity scheduler should just ask for a task iff the TT has enough memory and the let the JobInProgress hand out normal, failed or speculative tasks as is done in the default scheduler.\n\nSuppose the TT does not have enough memory to run a high-mem job's task. This usually happens because the TT is running other tasks which are consuming memory. In order to prevent the high-mem job from starving, we'd like to return nothing to the TT, in the hope that eventually the TT will finish all its tasks and will have enough memory to run this job's tasks. In the meantime, if another TT comes along with enough mem, great. However, suppose the high-mem job has no further task to run: no pending tasks and no speculative tasks (assume all running tasks are making adequate progress). In this case, returning nothing to the TT is a waste. You should move on to the next job. So I need a way to tell me if the job potentially has a task to run. Granted this is not perfect. At that moment, the job may decide that it can run a speculative task, but when you actually ask it for a task (which happens at a later heartbeat), it may return nothing because at that point, the potentially speculative task has made enough progress. But still, you want to minimize under-utilizing TTs while at the same time, preventing starvation of high-mem jobs. \n\nI was mainly soliciting ways to better detect if a job has a task to run. The approach in the patch is to use the same code path that obtains a new task, but not update any data structures.

Your patch does solve the requirement we have. However, we share your concern about the code structure - the passing of the flag top down to all APIs from the start, and the number of conditional checks. Also, we understand that the motivation to make the changes to obtainNewMapTask and family is so that we can retain the exact same code for looking up tasks, and thus take care of conditions like black listed trackers etc. So, it's a tradeoff between the code structure and the generic solution that is proposed.\n\nWe can make the tradeoff in the other way, by handling the condition for speculative tasks alone. Something like:\n{code}\nif (memory requirements pass) {\n  return task from jobinprogress;\n} else {\n  if (job has pending or speculative tasks) {\n    block;\n  } else {\n    move on to next job;\n  }\n}\n{code}\nThis may require an API like findSpeculativeTask which only looks at code dealing with speculative tasks, and does not need to make changes to the core APIs like obtainNewMapTask. It seems (haven't looked at deeply), that this could simplify the code structure quite a bit, while addressing the requirement we currently have. The other cases do not seem to require special handling as of now. For e.g. if a tracker is blacklisted, it would anyway not return any task, so this is equivalent to the condition of job has no pending tasks.

If you look at the code for JobInProgress.findNewMapTask(), which really is the big core method that needs to be updated, the first part of it deals with finding a pending task to run, and the second part of it deals with finding a speculative task. The latter code is non-trivial, i.e., it involves 3 stages and about 60 lines of code. Proposal 2 will result in fewer if-blocks, but the changes will qualitatively be the same (i.e., you'll still have to pass the readOnly parameter and still wrap data structure changes and log methods with if-blocks, albeit only for these 60 lines). A quick glance at my patch shows that you'll cut down the if-blocks from about 17 to about 7. On one hand, that is a decrease, but it's not qualitatively different and you'll likely move the code to find speculative tasks into a separate method, thus adding to the refactoring of this core method. Either way, it looks like we'll have to bite the bullet no matter what, if you're considering only these two proposals. \n\nOne issue I do have with Proposal 2 is that we're replicating the logic of finding a task to run, in the Capacity Scheduler. In your code example, you're assuming that if a job does not have pending or speculative tasks, JobInProgress.obtainNewMapTask() will return null. That's not such a good assumption for a couple of related reasons: \na. if this logic changes in JobInProgress, you have to update the Capacity Scheduler code. Granted that this logic is likely not going to change, or that eventually all this code belongs in a Scheduler module anyways, so maybe this is not a big issue. \nb. findNewMapTask() has additional logic that you should consider: whether the TT is blacklisted (shouldRunOnTaskTracker()), and whether the TT has enough disk space. The latter we probably don't care about much, because the disk space, like the amount of free memory, gets better if we let the TT finish its tasks. The former,however, is important. If no task in the job can run on the TT (because many tasks of the job have failed on that TT), then the scheduler logic needs to reflect that (i.e., the scheduler blocks if there are pending or speculative tasks AND the TT is not blacklisted). Which ties in to my first point: you're replicating the logic of findNewMapTask() in the scheduler, which doesn't buy you much, and if you do it, you'll need to separate out the various steps in the logic (finding a pending tasks, finding a speculative task ) into separate methods, and make JobInProgress.shouldRunOnTaskTracker() public.\n\nBasically, I don't see Proposal 2 as qualitatively better than Proposal 1, which is why I didn't consider it. In its favor, it cuts down the if-blocks by more than half. But is that enough reason to replicate the findNewMapTask() logic in the scheduler? I personally think not. \n\nAlso remember that in proposal 1, we're not altering the signature of JobInProgress in the sense that its current callers do not change. It still exposes obtainNewMapTask(), with the same parameters. We've added a new method, hasNewMapTask(). It's only internally that we use the ugly readOnly flag. A minor point, but I wanted to point it out.\n\nbq. This may require an API like findSpeculativeTask which only looks at code dealing with speculative tasks, and does not need to make changes to the core APIs like obtainNewMapTask\n\nDepends on how you see it. The code that deals with finding speculative tasks is, today, within the core API findNewMapTask(). You'll still affect the core API if you move it out, but yes, I get your point that you won't have to surround the remaining code by if-blocks. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-01-13T09:39:18.946+0000","updated":"2009-01-13T09:39:18.946+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12411674/comment/12663616","id":"12663616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vivekr","name":"vivekr","key":"vivekr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vivek Ratan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching new patch (4981.2.patch).

I agree with Matei - detecting if a job has a task to run does seem to be an a relatively important functionality that can be used in scheduling (see another use-case below). \n\nbq. In any case a high-mem job might not have a task to run at a given moment, but what happens when it's running tasks fail, tasktrackers go down etc. ?\nI don't see any problem here. If a high-mem job doesn't currently have tasks to run, you move on to the next job. If running tasks fail or TTs go down, the high-mem job will eventually have tasks to run, so that at some point, when we check if it has tasks to run, the answer is yes, and we will block the TT. The opposite case is a bit more interesting. A job may say it has tasks to run because, at that point, one of the tasks is a candidate for speculation as it's progressing slowly. So you block the TT. Eventually, the task that could have been speculated catches up, so that when a slot is actually free, you don't really need to run a speculative task. So you did block a TT unnecessarily. But I think that's OK, rare, and probably unavoidable. \n\nbq. From a design perspective we have to recognize that currently the Map-Reduce framework isn't fundamentally setup for what you are trying to do\nThat's not clear to me. You ask a JobInProgress to give you a task. In terms of design, it seems perfectly natural to ask a JobInProgress object if it has a task (a 'peek' versus a 'get'). Or, if it gives you a task, you can ask it to take it back. This feature can be very useful in some other use cases. We've heard of jobs that deal with third party licenses. Maps in different jobs may need to access different licenses to run (or, instead of licenses, you can think of rate limiting: at any given time, only, say, 30 maps can have an open connection to some external resource).What is needed then is to first find out which task from which job would run, then check if the license for that particular task is valid. If not, you want to put the task back in the job, so to speak. So design-wise, I see this as a useful feature and logical to have in JobInProgress. If you're suggesting that there's too much code to untangle to support this feature, that's a slightly different situation. Are you? Granted that a read-only flag is somewhat ugly, does it make the code so much un-maintainable that we prefer taking a performance hit? I'm not so sure. Sure, the performance hit can be mitigated by ignoring the high-mem job occasionally, but you can end up with a not-insignificant number of TTs being blocked if the high-mem job also has a large number of tasks.\n\nI also think that skipping a high mem job for a certain period can really hurt. The code, based on comments in HADOOP-4667, will look like this: \n{code}\nif (TT has enough space for the high-mem job) {\n  get task from high-mem job;\n}\nelse {\n  if (we've skipped this job too many times already) {\n    block TT (return no task to it);\n  }\n  else {\n    note that we're skipping this job;\n    look at next job;\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nThe whole point of blocking a TT is that you want it to finish its existing tasks quickly so it has enough space for the high-mem job, i..e, you're improving the chances of the TT to satisfy this job's request the next time. If you delay the blocking, you do NOT improve the chances of a high-mem job being satisfied by the TT as much. By delaying blocking, you're going to end up starving high-mem jobs even more. \n\nI realize that the fix involves a non-trivial refactoring of critical code, but I'm not convinced we can't or shouldn't do it. Anybody else agree/disagree? Again, does the read-only flag really make the code so un-maintainable? My first patch was just a way to see how we can do something. Let me see if I (or someone else) can make it better, but it'll be good to understand how ugly or un-maintainable it really makes the code.
