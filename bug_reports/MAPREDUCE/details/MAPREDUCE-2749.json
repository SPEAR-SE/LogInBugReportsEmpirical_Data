While this works, my concern is that if we do it this way, by the time {{NodeManager.start()}} returns, the server isn't still guaranteed to be ready for service. I think we can do this another way. If we move {{ContainerTokenSecretManager}} to the top level {{NodeManager}} composite, we can set the keys as the last step in {{NodeManager.start()}}. Thoughts?\n\nAlso, we can add a test for this - mock {{rpc.getServer()}} to throw an exception and verify that ResourceManager doesn't have any registered NM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-03T10:30:37.134+0000","updated":"2011-09-03T10:30:37.134+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12515740/comment/13098166","id":"13098166","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Hey Vinod, thanks for the feedback. what is we move the ContainerTokenSecretManager to the top level NodeManager composite and also pass it into the NodeStatusUpdater so it can update it as soon as it register with RM?

I'll take another look at the test to see if I can get away from using minicluster.   The issue I have with this is that to me it is a system/component test and not a unit test - when nodemanager fails to start another component (RM) should do or in this case not do something.  When I was looking it really seemed like to really test it you want all the regular init/start code in the nm so mocking that didn't seem useful.  We could perhaps mock the rm register routine which is what the mini cluster already does for in process communication.
