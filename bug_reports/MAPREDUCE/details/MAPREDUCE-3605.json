You need to add YARN & MR jars to classpath etc.\n{quote}\n\n Including YARN & MR jars on classpath wont be necessary as the hadoop script is delegating the command and its params to mapred shell command. This is similar to executing hdfs command and since that works out of the box with-out explicitly setting classpath, so a similar behavior can be expected from this as well.\n\n\nBesides above. There should exist a \"hadoopctl\" (A typical script found with most standard opensource utils) script which provides a central way of executing scripts or doing all the tasks. Accompanied by a proper man page it would serve as a standard way of starting various daemons with complete configuration details. Standard because most of the other opensource tools and even bigger applications have such support. \n\nA worth-noting advantage it provides is that - with changing of design of internal classes e.g. deprecation and changes in classpath etc... The hadoopctl script will serve as a complete abstraction and wont bother end user. Second advantage will be limiting the number of variables needed to export and Third will be users will have to consult just one script to build there way of automating hadoop installation by building scripts on the top of hadoopctl by consulting a simple man page. Segregation of three projects is great but consulting documentations and script of three different projects to do one thing doesn't that cool. \n\nThoughts? \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prashant_","name":"prashant_","key":"prashant_","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Prashant Sharma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2011-12-29T07:02:47.702+0000","updated":"2011-12-29T07:02:47.702+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12536525/comment/13187265","id":"13187265","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@Prashanth,\n Looks like you already had the patch.
