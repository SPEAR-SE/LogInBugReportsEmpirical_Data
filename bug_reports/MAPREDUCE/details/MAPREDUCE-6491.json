Map<String, String> environment,\n      String variable, String value, String classPathSeparator) {\n    String val = environment.get(variable);\n    if (val == null) {\n      val = value;\n    } else

results for any variable that isn't path-like.  For example, we ran across a MapReduce job that had something like this in its environment settings:\n\nyarn.app.mapreduce.am.env='JAVA_HOME=/inst/jdk,JAVA_HOME=/inst/jdk'\n\nRather than ending up with JAVA_HOME=/inst/jdk as one would expect, JAVA_HOME instead was set to /inst/jdk:/inst/jdk which completely broke the job.\n\nIt seems to me that we should either use a whitelist of variables that support appending or never append settings.  For the latter case if users desire values to be appended then they can ask for it explicitly in their variable settings, like one of these forms depending upon whether they want client-side environment variable expansion or container-side environment variable expansion:\n{noformat}\nPATH='$PATH:/my/extra/path'\nPATH='{{PATH}}:/my/extra/path'\n{noformat}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-29T13:59:28.368+0000","updated":"2014-07-29T13:59:28.368+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12730478/comment/14077736","id":"14077736","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Post-HADOOP-9902, I wonder if it would be worthwhile to have this configured at the shell level. i.e., Have something that both the Java code and the shell could could read that would list the semantics of each known/important shell var.

Comments on the latest patch:\n\nThe newline after the Configuration.getTrimmedStringCollection was accidentally removed\n\nThere's a lot of unnecessary import changes in MRApps including conversions to using wildcard imports which are unrelated to this JIRA.\n\nAn entry for mapreduce.application.appendable.env.variables should be in mapred-default.xml with the appropriate default value and description for documentation purposes\n\n\"ClASSPATH\" s/b \"CLASSPATH\" in the unit test comment\n\nThe unit test is making an implicit assumption that MRApps.setClasspath is setting the environment variable iteratively, which is not a requirement for how it performs semantically.  That could change in the future and break this test.  A better unit test would be one that explicitly verifies MRapps.addtoEnvironment behavior directly by checking for path append behavior on variables in the configured append list and overwrite behavior for variables not in that list.\n\nI think the \"public static final\" should go back on the MRJobConfig additions to make it consistent with the rest of the file.  Checkstyle will complain, but for this instance I think consistency is better here given the benign nature of what it is complaining about.\n\nArrays.asList seems like simpler way to statically initialize the default value in MRJobConfig as there's no need for the anonymous class, serial version boilerplate, or invocation of add methods in a static block.\n\nThe \"/**\" line at the end of the MRJobConfig patch hunk had its indentation accidentally removed.\n\nI'm wondering if we should move this JIRA to the MAPREDUCE project since that's where most of the changes are and where most of the user-visible functionality appears.  The extreme case is to file three separate for the three affected projects, but that seems extreme for this case.

It is not guaranteed to work.  If a user puts in HADOOP_CLASSPATH=\"foo\" in hadoop-env.sh (or .hadooprc, but that would be weird on a compute node) the shell commands will NOT honor the append.  (So, for example, a user runs a streaming job that uses hadoop fs to add/remove files from a bundled-with-the-job fs impl will fail.)\n\nbq.  If that's the case, then we should be changing that test case for TestMRApps#testSetClasspathWithArchives to not rely on the appending behavior. \n\nI'll need to look at it, but probably.  It's probably working because HADOOP_CLASSPATH isn't set at all in default, out-of-the-box configuration.  On real systems, this has a chance to break.\n\nbq. Are you saying we should be adding HADOOP_TASK_CLASSPATH as an appendable variable by default and take out HADOOP_CLASSPATH from the list?\n\nWe accidentally dropped from the hadoop-env.sh comments the description of HADOOP_CLASSPATH, but it's effectively the user interface to setting additional classpaths.  So what might make sense is to keep HADOOP_CLASSPATH for users here but it gets turned into HADOOP_TASK_CLASSPATH, which is meant for the app framework to work with.  Thoughts?\n\nOf course, all of this is dependent upon MAPREDUCE-6458 getting finished too.
