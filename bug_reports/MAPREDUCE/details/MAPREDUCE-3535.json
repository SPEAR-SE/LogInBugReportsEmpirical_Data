The subclasses don't check it; they don't exit the start() method if they are already started, and they don't bail out early on a stop if they are already stopped -even when the superclass returns without doing anything.\n\nThis means that calling {{Service.start()}} twice may leak resources, {{Service.start()}} twice try to shut down twice, etc. And that's on the same thread...\n\nMy preferred action here would be for the ave the operations return true if a state change took place, the implementation would be synchronised and return the correct value\n\nThe subclasses look for this and only execute their state changes took place\n\ne.g\n{code}\nboolean start() {\n if (!super.start()) return false;\n //do my own startup\n return true;\n}\n{code}\n\nThe {{Service.stop()}} operation is trickier as the subclasses tend to call the superclass last for a better unwinding. I think it may be safer to work the other way around, but code reviews would be need to ensure that this doesn't break assumptions in the subclass about termination order. It may be possible to do more complex designs, but it is hard to chain this down a hierarchy of classes.

It would declare it's init/start/stop methods final, do the state change, then delegate to the {{protected}} methods {{innerInit()}} {{innerStart()}}, {{innerStop()}}.
