Unfortunately the RMContainerAllocator never updates the service name of the token, so it ends up not being selected by the RPC layer when reconnecting to the RM.\n\n2) The RMContainerAllocator for some reason tries to update the login user rather than the current user when security is enabled.  This ends up updating a token in the UGI that is _not_ being used by the IPC layer when reconnecting to the RM on a secure cluster.\n\nAlso note that the AMRM token is mapped with an empty service name in the credentials, so if the token service is updated before adding it to the credentials we can end up with two AMRM tokens (one with an empty service key and one with a non-empty service key).  So we need to be careful when adding the new token to the credentials that we will indeed be clobbering the old token, as we need to use a consistent service/alias that we cannot obtain directly from the credentials.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2015-01-27T16:49:43.551+0000","updated":"2015-01-27T16:49:43.551+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12770391/comment/14295331","id":"14295331","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Based on [my comment from YARN-3103|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-3103?focusedCommentId=14295216&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-14295216] here's a patch to store the token into the *current* UGI using whatever service name the RM set as the key/alias to clobber the existing token and then updates the service name *after* the token has been stored in the credentials.\n\nAdded a unit test and also manually tested the patch on a secure cluster where the RM rolled the AMRM token master key and then restarted the RM after it activated while the app was still running.
