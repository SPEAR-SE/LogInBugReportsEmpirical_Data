Uploading here to see if this makes sense.\n\nCopy&Pasting his comment.\n{noformat} \nI tried to reproduce this on a small cluster (60 nodes) with hadoop 0.20.202.\n\nSteps to reproduce the issue:\n===============================\n1. Setup file sink for jobtracker, so that we can get waiting_maps counter in a\nseparate file\n2. Have queue configs similar to that of production (i took **** config)\n3. Submit a simple sort job with -Dmapred.job.queue.name=\"search_general\". This\nqueue should not be present in the cluster. Now, the waiting_maps would get\ninto -ve value. Example is given below.\n\n1298346748441 mapred.jobtracker: context=mapred, sessionId=,\nhostName=, waiting_maps=-120, waiting_reduces=-16,\njobs_failed=1, jobs_preparing=0\n\nProblem:\n========\n1. WaitingMaps are incremented in JobInProgress.initTasks(). If a user gets an\nexception even before tasks are initialized, JobInProgress decrements the\nwaiting_maps wrongly in garbageCollect(). This causes -ve values in\nwaiting_maps and waiting_reduces.\n\nTried the following code change in JobInProgress for fixing:\n============================================================\n//check if tasks are initialized, and decrement waiting_maps accordingly.\nif (tasksInited) {\n        // Let the JobTracker know that a job is complete\n        jobtracker.getInstrumentation().decWaitingMaps(getJobID(),\npendingMaps());\n        jobtracker.getInstrumentation().decWaitingReduces(getJobID(),\npendingReduces());\n      }\n\nNeed to check with dev for reviewing the above logic. \n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-03-15T22:51:07.438+0000","updated":"2012-03-15T23:00:40.518+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12425712/comment/13250207","id":"13250207","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I believe this will still miss a case when it is killed while in progress of initializing the job.
