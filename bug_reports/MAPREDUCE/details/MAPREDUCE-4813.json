We will need states capturing those calls and put them on separate threads so that dispatches isn't blocked. We can do that later, but to be future-proof, let's move the committer-thread to a top-level service ala TaskCleaner. We may even re-purpose TaskCleanerImpl for this. Scope the effort and split it as you see fit.\n - Commit-thread interrupting and joining is only meaning-ful in the case of kill-during-commit. So let's move that code there. Also, earlier, we never supported kill-during-commit, but now we do and the patch is putting a 60second upper bound on commitJob() before abortJob(). Comparing this with 1.*, we do allow kill-during-commit as commit happens in a separate JVM. So interrupt and join seems fine, let's just put in a config so that we can tweak if ever there is a need.\n - The test looks good. Can you extend it to include kill-during-commit too.

Previously it processed the setupJob callback synchronously within the MRAppMaster.start method, and this seemed like the cleanest way to handle the now asynchronous nature of the committer callback.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-12-14T23:46:51.909+0000","updated":"2012-12-14T23:46:51.909+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617119/comment/13532815","id":"13532815","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I am not done with my review, but I wanted to give you a heads up on them.\n\nIt looks like it may be possible to get a JOB_START event after a JOB_KILL event.  This would be a very rare race condition where someone is trying to kill their job right after starting it.  I am not sure if it is even possible in practice, especially after this patch where the setup is removed from the critical path. So I would suggest that we file a minor JIRA to fix this at some point.\n\nAlso it looks like we need to handle JOB_MAP_TASK_RESCHEDULED and JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED in the FAIL_ABORT state.  In the KILL_ABORT state we don't need to worry about them because the KILL_WAIT state should make sure all tasks have completed before going on, but there is no corresponding FAIL_WAIT state.

We are not catching it and threadpool will likely just eat it.  This could result in a deadlock.
