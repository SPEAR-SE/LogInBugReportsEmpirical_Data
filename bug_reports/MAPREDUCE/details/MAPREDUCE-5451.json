this is not a fix to the exception you saw.\n\nLD_LIBRARY_PATH and PATH are used for OS functions to dynamically load libraries, i.e. they are for dlopen() and LoadLibrary() on Linux and Windows respectively.\nOn the other hand, the JNI libraries or DLLs load path is configured via the Java property -Djava.library.path, which is used by Java API System.loadLibrary (not to be confused with Windows LoadLibrary()).\nI think the exception you saw was caused by the second API failure, i.e. native library is not loaded, instead of a foreign library missing on PATH.\nTo confirm, you could check if you have following warnings in your log entries prior to the exception.\n{noformat}\nUnable to load native-hadoop library for your
