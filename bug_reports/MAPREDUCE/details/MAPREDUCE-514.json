Now, when it asks the {{CapacitySchedulerConf}} for a property for this queue, if nothing is configured for this queue in {{capacity-scheduler.xml}}, a hard-coded default value is returned. This may not be what the administrator intended, because the defaults are not defined by him/her. Hence, this issue exists.\n\nHADOOP-4178 is trying to implement a mechanism to make these default values itself configurable. If it does that, then it would be a feature that if a property is not configured for a queue in the capacity scheduler's configuration, the configured default is used. This makes it very simple for the administrator to define new queues. And it would invalidate the need to check for invalid queues, as required by this issue.\n\nSo in summary, if HADOOP-4178 is fixed, we can mark this bug as invalid.
