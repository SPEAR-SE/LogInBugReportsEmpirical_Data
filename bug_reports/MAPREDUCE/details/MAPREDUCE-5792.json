This should be a relatively rare occurrence as the intermediate base directory not being writable indicates the cluster wasn't setup properly.  Actually I'm a bit curious as to how this even occurred in the first place.  The history server should have setup the proper permissions when it started.  [~tthompso] can you elaborate more on how the intermediate directory happened to have the wrong permissions?  I'm wondering if there's a related bug in the history server that needs to be fixed.\n\nArguably this wouldn't be a big deal if we solved the larger issue of diagnostics from the AM crash not making it back to the job client.  The AM logs should already be stating what's going wrong (e.g.: \"Error creating user intermediate history done directory\" exception and cause).  If the user saw that error message from the client when the job crashed then it would be clearer to the user why the job failed.  YARN-675 was supposed to help this at least somewhat, and providing proper diagnostics would also help similar issues like the AM crashing when metainfo split size is exceeded, see MAPREDUCE-4937.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-12T14:25:42.099+0000","updated":"2014-03-12T14:25:42.099+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700620/comment/13934153","id":"13934153","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tthompso","name":"tthompso","key":"tthompso","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659"},"displayName":"Travis Thompson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree, the specific issue of the directory permissions being wrong is not really the issue here.

I'm not sure who's supposed to be handling log viewing besides the JHS which is specific to M/R jobs.\n\nThe JHS can serve logs even for non-MR jobs.  It was a hack to provide an aggregated log server before one existed.  Now in recent 2.x I believe the YARN Application History/Timeline Server can serve up logs as well.  On our 0.23 clusters we are using the JHS to serve up aggregated logs, and yarn.log.server.url is configured to {noformat}http://jhs-server-name:port/jobhistory/nmlogs{noformat}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-14T14:15:46.310+0000","updated":"2014-03-14T14:15:46.310+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700620/comment/13935522","id":"13935522","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tthompso","name":"tthompso","key":"tthompso","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659"},"displayName":"Travis Thompson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Let me double check {{yarn.log.server.url}}, I think you're on to something.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tthompso","name":"tthompso","key":"tthompso","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659"},"displayName":"Travis Thompson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-14T19:38:14.168+0000","updated":"2014-03-14T19:38:14.168+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700620/comment/13935786","id":"13935786","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tthompso","name":"tthompso","key":"tthompso","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tthompso&avatarId=21659"},"displayName":"Travis Thompson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"So I didn't have {{yarn.log.server.url}} set, and after setting that log redirection off the NM works, yay.
