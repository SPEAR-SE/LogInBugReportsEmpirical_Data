Nice patch. A few small comments:\n\n- JobHistoryPathFilter should have InterfaceAudience and InterfaceStability annotations. I'd probably say @InterfaceAudience.Private and @InterfaceStability.Evolving. This will indicate better that it's only package-accessible so that the jsp can get to it.\n- please add at least a brief javadoc on what the filter does.\n- Similarly, the comments at the head of matchUser, matchJobId, and validJobHistory should probably be converted to JavaDoc comments with /** ... */ (I see you've just moved this code, but while we're at it, we might as well fix that)\n- the javadoc for TestJobHistoryPathFilter seems to refer to some other test\n- can you please use JUnit 4 for the new test cases? i.e import org.junit.Test and use @Test annotations instead of extending TestCase\n\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-05-19T02:29:04.673+0000","updated":"2011-05-19T02:29:04.673+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498424/comment/13042549","id":"13042549","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=asunwoo","name":"asunwoo","key":"asunwoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Albert Sunwoo","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Please Code Review latest patch.
