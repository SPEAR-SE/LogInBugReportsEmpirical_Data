TaskTracker sets a justStarted flag to true when starting up\n2. One way it uses this flag is to check job tracker versions -the version is only checked when justStarted==true, which is reset after the check.\n3. If a JobTracker is unreachable, then the TaskTracker sleeps for 5 seconds and then continues\n\nThere is a risk, therefore, that if the job tracker goes down, a different version might come back up, and the Task Tracker will not notice until it makes an incompatible IPC call.\n\nThis is a pretty unlikely scenario; you've got to kill the job tracker and bring up a different versioned one in 5 seconds. And the consequence of IPC incompatiblity will be a lost task, regardless of whether this happens early or later in the process. I'm not sure it's worth fixing.
