SchedulerApp is 20k so when the patch deletes and adds back in the same code it adds 40k to the size of the patch.  If you want to change the names I can, it is not a big deal, but I don't think that Scheduler*/Scheduler*Impl really indicate the design pattern being used.  I am not trying to separate out interface from implementation.  There is just one implementation and no place in the code to allow another one to be inserted through configuration.  I am just trying to expose a read only subset of the information about this data structure.  After making the change to SchedulerNodeReport, I think it would be best to make the new interface SchedulerAppReport as well.  This fits in with the naming conventions used elsewhere.  I think I will upload a new patch with it changed to Report.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-30T14:04:19.919+0000","updated":"2011-09-30T14:04:19.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523752/comment/13118130","id":"13118130","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Canceling patch to upmerge and rename the one class.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-30T15:17:07.245+0000","updated":"2011-09-30T15:17:07.245+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523752/comment/13118315","id":"13118315","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Canceling patch to do some more refactoring.
