Files passed using -file option are packaged into a jar and unjarred on the computing node. So, it wont preserve the execute permissions on the file.\n\nThere's no obvious reason it shouldn't.  Jar files are zipfiles, and at least the ant-built ones are created using Info-ZIP's zip (or something based on it), which preserves Unix perms for every file.  For example, here's one of the directories in my hadoop-common/build/hadoop-common-0.22.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:\n\n{noformat} \nCentral directory entry #5:\n---------------------------\n\n  org/apache/hadoop/\n\n  offset of local header from start of archive:     336 (00000150h) bytes\n  file system or operating system of origin:        Unix\n  version of encoding software:                     2.0\n  minimum file system compatibility required:       MS-DOS, OS/2 or NT FAT\n  minimum software version required to extract:     1.0\n  compression method:                               none (stored)\n  file security status:                             not encrypted\n  extended local header:                            no\n  file last modified on (DOS date/time):            2010 Jun 28 17:29:48\n  32-bit CRC value (hex):                           00000000\n  compressed size:                                  0 bytes\n  uncompressed size:                                0 bytes\n  length of filename:                               18 characters\n  length of extra field:                            0 bytes\n  length of file comment:                           0 characters\n  disk number on which file begins:                 disk 1\n  apparent file type:                               binary\n  Unix file attributes (040755 octal):              drwxr-xr-x\n  MS-DOS file attributes (10 hex):                  dir \n{noformat}\n\nIf the corresponding Unix unzip were used to do the unpacking, the Unix perms would be restored correctly.
