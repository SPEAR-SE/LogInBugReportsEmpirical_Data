Like the patch says - an additional state, which would have to deal with new container and finishApp requests. Also, an intermittent failure in app initialization would end up making the node unusable for the specific app.\n\nChanging DCE to remove the delete in {code}createAppDirs{code} is probably a simpler fix ? job.jar and job.xml are separate App resources which are localized into their own directory. One failing should not affect the other (will only affect the container associated with the failed localization attempt). Don't think the comment in the code about cleaning up the dir is valid.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-20T08:15:03.601+0000","updated":"2011-10-20T08:15:03.601+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12526505/comment/13134604","id":"13134604","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Here's the simple fix as suggested.
