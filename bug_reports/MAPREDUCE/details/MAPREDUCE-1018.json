Rahul mentioned offline that forrest documentation is not getting generated in mapreduce sub-project. Assuming we'll address that in a separate issue, I propose we have only one patch - the mapred one.\n\n - The mapred Patch has git prefixes which need to be removed\n\n - Monitoring/Scheduling based on RAM is completely removed. So remove the references too. Just add a note saying that (quoting from HADOOP-5881) there isn't any need for distinguishing vmem from physical memory w.r.t configuration. Depending on a site's requirements, the configuration items can reflect whether one wants tasks to go beyond physical memory or not.\n\ncluster_setup.html\n - All config names should be renamed to the new names. Of-course this means a slightly different patch for 0.20 - which we will come to after the patch\n for trunk's done\n - mapred.{map|reduce}.child.ulimit also need to be renamed\n - What happens when monitoring is enabled, but job has -1?\n - Memory-monitoring is no longer defined in terms of per-task-limit and per-node-limit. It is now driven by per-slot-size and number of slots. We should use these new terms through-out.\n - \"Before getting into details, consider the following additional memory-related parameters than can be configured to enable better scheduling:\"\\\n The above line is no longer needed.\n \ncapacity_scheduler.html\n - Feature for monitoring RAM no more. Remove all references.\n - Working of scheduling\n   -- Point 1: 4 parameters, not three. Parameters described in cluster_setup.  vmem.reserved no more used.\n   -- Point 2: This is changed completely. No more offsets.\n   Total = numSlots * PerSlotMemSize.\n   Used = Sigma(numSlotsPerTask * PerSlotMemSize)\n   -- Point 3: JT now rejects the jobs, not the scheduler.\n - \"See the MapReduce Tutorial for details on how the TT monitors memory usage.\"\n \"See cluster_setup\" instead?\n\n - Need to update mapred_tutorial.html's memory management section. Aslo need a reference to this in both cluster_setup.html as well as capacity_scheduler.html\n\n - Another point I've already mentioned on the JIRA.\n \"Along with everything else, we should document that job setup and job cleanup tasks of all jobs, either requiring or not requiring high memory for their maps and reduces, still run on a single slot.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-16T06:59:43.010+0000","updated":"2009-11-16T06:59:43.010+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426912/comment/12779967","id":"12779967","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"incorporated vinod's comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-19T13:05:47.648+0000","updated":"2009-11-19T13:05:47.648+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426912/comment/12788508","id":"12788508","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Looked at the latest patch. I've some more comments. Some of the following may not have been introduced by your patch though.\nh4.cluster_setup.html\n - Statement I: _Users can, optionally, specify the MEM task-limit per job. If no such limit is provided, a default limit is used. A node-limit can be set per node._\nWe don't have default limits anymore. So the statement _\"If no such limit is provided, a default limit is used.\"_ can be removed.\n - Node-limit cannot be set directly anymore. So, we should define the node limit here by saying _\"Node-limit of total memory usage for tasks is given by Node-limit = mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum * mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb +  mapreduce.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum * mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb\"_.\n - _To enable monitoring for a TT, the following parameters all need to be set:_\nThis is not true w.r.t job configuration. So this table should only have TT configuration. And move job configuration to another table. We should move the above statement to later and thus the whole section would look like\n{quote}\nTo enable monitoring for a TT, the following parameters all need to be set:\nTABLE:I with TT parameters\nNode-limit of total memory usage for tasks is given by Node-limit = mapreduce.tasktracker.map.tasks.maximum * mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb +  mapreduce.tasktracker.reduce.tasks.maximum * mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb\"\nUsers can, optionally, specify the MEM task-limit per job.\nTABLE II with Job parameters\n{quote}\n - _2. Periodically, the TT checks the following:_\nShould be \"If memory monitoring is enabled, the TT does the following periodically:\"\n\nh4. mapred_tutorial.html:\n - Memory management section defines the job parameters again here. But \"mapreduce.map.memory.mb\" is repeated twice, one of them should be \"mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb\"\n - _Users can choose to override default limits of memory enforced by the task tracker, if memory management is enabled. Users can set the following parameter per job:_\nPlease modify \"memory management\" to be \"memory monitoring\" and link it to the monitoring section in cluster_setup.html\n\nh4. capacity_scheduler.html:\n - Please rename the section name to \"Memory-based task-scheduling\"\n - _The Capacity Scheduler supports scheduling of tasks on a TaskTracker(TT) based on a job's memory requirements and the availability of RAM and Virtual Memory (VMEM) on the TT node._\nAs my previous review comments mentioned, support for RAM availability is no longer there. So it should read _\"....and the availability of Virtual Memory (VMEM) on the TT node. There isn't any need for distinguishing VMEM from physical memory w.r.t tasks. Depending on a site's requirements, the configuration can be set depending on whether one wants tasks to go beyond physical memory or not.\"_\n - _\"See the MapReduce Tutorial for details on how the TT monitors memory usage.\"_\nThis should actually point to cluster_setup.html. Previous review comment missed.\n - _\"Currently the memory based scheduling is only supported in Linux platform.\"_\n   This isn't quite right. It should be _\"Memory based scheduling primarily exists to avoid memory pressure by tasks on a TT and thus is dependent on TT-memory monitoring which currently is only supported in Linux platform.\"_\n - _\"1. The absence of any one or more of four config parameters or -1 being set as value of any of the parameters, mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb, mapreduce.cluster.reducememory.mb, or mapreduce.jobtracker.maxmapmemory.mb, mapreduce.jobtracker.maxreducememory.mb  disables memory-based scheduling, just as it disables memory monitoring for a TT. These config parameters are described in the MapReduce Tutorial. \"_\n    This can be greatly simplified to _\"The configuration properties mapreduce.cluster.mapmemory.mb, mapreduce.cluster.reducememory.mb, or mapreduce.jobtracker.maxmapmemory.mb, mapreduce.jobtracker.maxreducememory.mb are used to enable/disable memory based scheduling. The absence of being set as -1 of any one of these properties disables memory-based scheduling, just as it disables monitoring for a TT. These parameters are described in the Cluster-setup <a href=\"cluster_setup.html#memory_monitoring\">memory-monitoring section</a>.\"_\n - The second statement that describes scheduling can be greatly simplified by writing it as a list of points, like my previous review described. Also, we haven't introduces reservations anywhere else, so that part also needs to be explained so and clear. Roughly,\n{quote}\n    * Point 2 in Working of scheduling\n      Total = numSlots * PerSlotMemSize.\n      Used = Sigma(numSlotsPerTask * PerSlotMemSize)\n      if (can fit), schedule. Otherwise reserve.  Reserve why? what?

The changes over earlier patches are primarily in the nature of presentation.\n\nA brief summary:\n\n- Mapreduce Tutorial: This now describes all the Job specific memory configuration options. The expectation is that users who have questions about how to configure memory requirements for their jobs can get answers here.\n\n- Cluster Setup: This describes memory monitoring, links to the job specific options in the Mapreduce tutorial, and describes in detail how to configure cluster specific memory configuration options. I've removed the duplication of describing the job specific options in both the places, since I felt it will be a problem to maintain changes. This describes memory related aspects from an administrator point of view.\n\n- Capacity Scheduler: This describes memory based scheduling. Instead of spelling the precise algorithm out, I have given a gist of how the scheduler works. The description is more in terms of *what* the scheduler does, rather than how it does it.\n\nRequest a review of the same. Please ensure that all the required content is captured, and I've not missed out anything when reorganizing. Also, please check if the documentation is clear to understand.\n\nOne thing I've not included is the documentation on the RSS based monitoring introduced in MAPREDUCE-1221. I am not yet familiar with that part of the code. Also, this patch itself looks reasonably big. Hence, I would request for those changes to be incorporated as a follow-up, though they should be treated as a blocker for the 0.21 release as well.
