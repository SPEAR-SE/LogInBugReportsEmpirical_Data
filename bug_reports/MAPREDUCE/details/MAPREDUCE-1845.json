Thanks for adding the unit tests too. We should check this into 0.21 as well, if that's not out yet.\n\nThe only concern I have is that the existing unit tests, such as testMinAndFairSharePreemption, work correctly. This seems to be because those pools either only test one type of preemption (min-share or fair-share), or they place the over-scheduled jobs in pools that have no min share set. This means that one of the values in max(tasksDueToMinShare, tasksDueToFairShare) is zero. Would you mind creating a second copy of testMinAndFairSharePreemption where job 1 is in a pool with a min share set (i.e. not in the default pool)?\n\nA minor comment on clarity: rather than adding the line \"tasksToPreempt = tasksToPreempt < 0 ? 0 : tasksToPreempt\", it would be better to make sure that tasksDueToMinShare and tasksDueToFairShare are themselves never negative. You can do it by adding a max(0, ...) on the lines where they are computed (for example, tasksDueToMinShare = Math.max(0, target - sched.getRunningTasks())).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-06-24T21:47:17.102+0000","updated":"2010-06-24T21:47:17.102+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12466374/comment/12882373","id":"12882373","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schen","name":"schen","key":"schen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Chen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks.\nGood suggestions.
