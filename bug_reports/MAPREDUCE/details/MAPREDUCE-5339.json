All methods of the Job class should be checked to make sure that the context is clear. isRetired does not indicate how a job gets Retired since there is no setRetired.

It would seem that root queues are created first and these root queues have child queues. It is also not clear what one would do if they get child queues without knowing which root queue it is associated with. Is that important? \nDoes getAllQeues return root queues + child queues? This question is not well answered. \n\n\nCluster also keeps blacklisted Task Trackers.
