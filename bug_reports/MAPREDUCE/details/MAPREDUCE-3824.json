Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I like the concept of the patch.  Volatile is definitely needed here, my bad on that one.  I also like that you are doing a DU to update the size of the cached objects if they are 0.  I do have some issues with the patch though.\n\nThe first is that even though the DU size update is being done on a separate thread it is being done with the cachedArchives lock held.  The amount of time it takes to do a DU could be significant.  Nothing new can be added to the cache while the cachedArchives lock is held, so it could be blocking other new tasks from making progress.  I would really prefer to see this done in two passes, similar to how we delete out entries.  The first pass would go through all entries and identify those that need to be updated, the second pass would be to update those entries without the lock held.  Then once we have all of the entries updated we can look at cleaning up the distributed cache. \n\nThe second is that we are updating the size too late.  We decide how much space needs to be deleted to get us back under the desired amount based totally on the size reported by BaseDirManager, which in turn gets its data from the CacheStatus object.  The issue is that in the current patch we first calculate how much needs to be removed, then we update the size of the archives, then we delete them.  This is not that critical, because it just means that in the next pass they would be deleted, so this is really very minor, but should be covered by doing the update in two passes.\n\nI am not sure exactly what are the situations that the size is not being set.  I would like to know exactly which situations the current code is missing, because like I said previously the code that computes the used size goes completely off of what is reported to BaseDirManager, unfortunately there are some issues with BaseDirManger where if we are too aggressive with setting the size we might double count some archives, which eventually would make it so that the BaseDirManager thinks it is full all the time, which would be very bad.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-02-07T16:06:12.794+0000","updated":"2012-02-07T16:06:12.794+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12541523/comment/13202612","id":"13202612","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"There is no doubt the patch is a hack, but it solved my immediate problems because as it stands, distributed caches are really broken at scale.\n\nSome background.  I have a team of users that have several 36GB distributed caches. When these caches are in play, most of the system is basically locked while these caches get built.  This patch was really geared towards making sure that these massive caches at least get deleted.  Without these patches in place, the mapred tmp spaces fill and tasks fail, eventually leading to mapred framework collapse. \n\nThere are a lot of other problems that show up with caches this large:\n* Hadoop doesn't have a size limit check on caches as part of the job submission process [So any hand waving about \"don't use caches that big!\" are null and void since there is no way to actually stop a user from doing that!]\n* the setup and cleanup tasks also trigger cache downloads.\n* tasktrackers appear to be frozen for *all* tasks during cache downloads, with the task stuck in the extremely unhelpful \"unassigned\" state.\n* the methodology of updating the private cache as a different step seems unnecessary given the permissions at the file system level.\n\nWhat really needs to happen is a massive overhaul of the entire distributed cache system.  But that's a bigger project, preferably for someone who gets paid to do hadoop development full time.  So, like all of the patches I've been submitting lately, I'm not expecting them to get committed. But this is enough of a patch for someone who needs a useable system until a working release ships.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-02-07T18:43:45.927+0000","updated":"2012-02-07T18:43:45.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12541523/comment/13202621","id":"13202621","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"PS, if the tasktracker can survive disk failure in 1.0, it must not work under these conditions.
