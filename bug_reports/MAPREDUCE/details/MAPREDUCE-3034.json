When do you think you can get a patch up? I was hoping to get this going within the next week.\n\nFrom my point of view, the basic requirement is to be able to bounce the RM without having to manually star every single NM in a very large cluster (thousands of NMs).\n\nRight now, when NM gets the reboot command from the RM, it just calls the stop hooks, just like if it gets a shutdown command. My plan is that if NM gets reboot command, it still executes the shutdown hook, but then add a reboot hook that executes the same basic code as was done to begin with in NameNode.main(). Is that your basic plan?\n\nI have already written up a \"proof-of-concept\" patch and tested it in a 10-node secure cluster. To test it, I shutdown RM and restarted it. After the restart, I ran an hour's worth of jobs and compared the time and heap size from before and after. They all looked good to me.\n\nThanks,\n-Eric","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-01-27T15:46:37.429+0000","updated":"2012-01-27T15:46:37.429+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523557/comment/13194880","id":"13194880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Eric.\n\nI am also doing same as you described.

The more I think about it, the more I think we should re-read the namenode configs when the NM restarts. My reason for this opinion is that, in this particular use case, the RM will have a new version of the configs, and you usually want the RMs configs and the NMs configs to match.\n\nOther than that, I am happy with the patch. I downloaded it and tested it in both a one-node simple cluster and in a 10-node security cluster. I restarted the RM several times and checked the heap dump to look for memory leaks, and I didn't see any. I also ran about 100 wordcount tests after restarting the RM/NMs.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-02-01T21:41:38.568+0000","updated":"2012-02-01T21:41:38.568+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523557/comment/13198842","id":"13198842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Eric for revewing and testing the patch.\n\nI have updated the patch with the suggested change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-02-02T14:45:53.811+0000","updated":"2012-02-02T14:45:53.811+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523557/comment/13198902","id":"13198902","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

I was able to verify this by examining the code, running tests, and examining the logs.\n\n# Verified by examining the code:\n** When the reboot command comes from the RM to the NM, NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.reboot() sets the isRebooted flag and calls NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.stop().\n** NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.stop() (eventually) calls both AbstractService.changeState() and CompositeService.stop(int numOfServicesStarted). These methods loop through the list of services registered with them and stop each one.\n# Verified by running tests:\n** With this change implemented, I started a long-running mapred job and then stopped and restarted the RM.\n** During the interval between stopping and restarting the RM, I took a snapshot of the java processes running.\n** Also, during the interval between stopping and restarting the RM, I searched the NM and container logs for messages from the AsyncDispatcher to determine if any services were stopped. None were.\n** After restarting the RM, I took another snapshot of the java processes. An examination indicated that prior to starting the RM, the long-running mapred job was still running with the MRAppMaster and the container running in YarnChild. After the RM started again, the MRAppMaster and YarnChild processes were gone.\n# Verified by examining logs:\n** After running the above test, I did another search through the NM and container logs and found several services that had been stopped via the AsyncDispatcher event process.
