This happens whenever there is an attempt to unreserve a job's tasks from a TaskTracker even though the reservation is for a job other than this job. This supposedly must have been done during MAPREDUCE-516 itself, but unfortunately missed (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-516?focusedCommentId=12721792&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12721792).\n\nThe resultant behavior is that when a task fails, one heartbeat of the TT is missed, but the next heartBeat passes through. This is because the first heartBeat marks the task as FAILED on the JobTracker and so the faulty code isn't invoked for the same TT again in further heartBeats. This leaves inconsistent state on the JT, for e.g, immediately following this is the code for creation of task completion event which would never be created for this task. This issue HAS to be fixed immediately because of the side effects.\n\nOne more thing I've observed while going through this is that reservations are not removed on a TaskTracker that is globally blacklisted either via large task-failure count or via unhealthy status.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-07-08T13:20:18.272+0000","updated":"2009-07-08T13:20:18.272+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429802/comment/12728800","id":"12728800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This patch seems to fix the expection, though I'm not sure why the test-case doesn't fail even with this exception.\n\nThe crux of the patch is:\n\n{code}\n-          taskTracker.unreserveSlots(TaskType.MAP, this);\n-          taskTracker.unreserveSlots(TaskType.REDUCE, this);\n+          if (trackersReservedForMaps.containsKey(trackerName)) {\n+            taskTracker.unreserveSlots(TaskType.MAP, this);\n+          }\n+          if (trackersReservedForReduces.containsKey(trackerName)) {\n+            taskTracker.unreserveSlots(TaskType.REDUCE, this);\n+          }\n{code}\n\n----\n\nI've also noticed that JobInProgress.addTrackerTaskFailure wasn't synchronized which breaks our invariant of locking JobTracker and JobInProgress (in-order), in particular from the call originating at JobTracker.lostTaskTracker.

Is there a good use case for this? The reason i am asking this is because globally blacklisted trackers are not considered for assigning new tasks at all. We may run into race conditions (especially for future jobs), where a globally blacklisted tracker may not be considered by jobs for assigning new tasks to, even when it is marked healthy (globally). For example, a job starts an hour before the tracker is supposed to be marked healthy, but since the job blacklists it prematurely, even after it is marked healthy, the job cannot make use of this tracker. This can probably be handled but it might complicate the logic of global blacklisting & per-job blacklisting.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2009-07-08T18:31:07.234+0000","updated":"2009-07-08T18:31:07.234+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12429802/comment/12728859","id":"12728859","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
