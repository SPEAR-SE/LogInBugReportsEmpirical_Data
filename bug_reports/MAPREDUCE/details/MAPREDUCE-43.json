You may also want to add a filter for the user, since that will be another common operation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-09-05T05:32:17.000+0000","updated":"2008-09-05T05:32:17.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403212/comment/12629099","id":"12629099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Discussed about this with Owen. Some conclusions -\n\n - Passing a filter through rpc doesn't seem to be a good idea, because of version related problems - different versions of client and server may have different sets of filters available, and even same filter class available on both client and server may be of different versions.\n\n - Instead, we can introduce job-submit-date for paging and user-name for basic filtering. These two will let the client get most of the relevant information without huge requests.\n   -- The RPC, then, will look like - \n     {code} JobStatus[] getJobStatus(long minSubmitDate, long maxJobs, String username) throws IOException; {code}\n   -- The usage looks like - \n      ||minSubmitDate       ||maxJobs ||usage||\n      |          =0                  |<=0        |Last 25 days(default) from last one day(default)|\n      |          =0                  | N           |Last N jobs  from last one day(default)|\n      |   Long..MAX_VALUE  | N           |Last N jobs|\n      |              M                | N           |Last N jobs from last M days|\n      |              M                |<=0       |Last 25(default) Jobs from last M days|\n      |    Long.MIN_VALUE   | N           |First N jobs|\n      |             -M                |N            |First N jobs from first M days|\n      |             -M                |<=0       |First 25 jobs(default) from first M days|\n      user = null will give list for all users.\n   -- For this, we need to add job-submit-time into JobStatus.\n\n - JobStatus filters can further cut down data flow from server to client. For now, we will just let state filters be on the client side, and add JobState filters later, if we see that we need them even on server side, perhaps as a part of another JIRA,.  Side note: We should define a JobState enum instead of using the int finals.\n\nRegarding the problem that I mentioned w.r.t getTaskCompletionEvents, we can get all information by giving a range of 0-MAX_INT. That would still be bad, but for now we continue trusting on the client to do it in a while loop getting say 1000 items at a time. If we wish to be fool-proof here too, may be we should limit, on the server side, the max number of items we send at a time.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2008-09-08T08:41:47.128+0000","updated":"2008-09-08T08:41:47.128+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403212/comment/13177951","id":"13177951","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I think it is OK to not show retired to users.
