If the job failed, it's confusing at best since the client was already told the job failed but the subsequent attempt could succeed.  If the job succeeded there could be data loss, as a subsequent job launched by the client tries to consume the job's output as input just as the re-attempt starts removing output files in preparation

The RM won't restart the app because it unregistered successfully, but the client is never notified.\n\nbq. In general it seems like we need to come up with a set of markers that previous AM's leave behind that can tell the next retry if the previous one failed/succeeded and so the current AM should exit or continue to run.\n\nExactly, and the AM is already doing this in the job history file which is how it helps supports recovery.  We should extend this so that even if the output committer doesn't support recovery the AM will check for markers in the job history file and prevent the job from executing tasks and committing output if final job status has been determined by previous attempts.  That way we prevent the AM from re-committing job output or changing the final job status after notifying the client.  We just need to make sure those markers are flushed to persistent store and located properly by future AM attempts before attempting to notify the client.  If subsequent attempts see the final job status marker then they should skip straight to the client notification process instead of running tasks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-27T14:43:11.179+0000","updated":"2012-11-27T14:43:11.179+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13504758","id":"13504758","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=knoguchi","name":"knoguchi","key":"knoguchi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Koji Noguchi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"bq. like the client never being notified at all because the AM crashes after unregistering with the RM but before it notifies the client.\n\nAs long as client eventually fail, that's not a problem.\n\nCritical problem we have here is false-positive from the client's perspective.\nClient is getting 'success' but output is incomplete or corrupt(due to retried application/job (over)writing to the same target path.)\n\nIf we can have AM and RM to agree on the job status before telling the client, I think that would work.

For example, if we finish committing the job and the committer is using a marker of sorts (e.g.: _SUCCESS), then we could trigger downstream jobs to run *before* the job history is completely closed.  I believe Oozie is polling for the _SUCCESS marker, for example.  If we crash after committing but before writing the job finished record then we could end up re-committing again while another job is attempting to consume our output, leading to potential data loss even though both jobs would have \"SUCCEEDED\".  That's a Bad Thing.\n\nI think the crux of the issue is that we must not commit twice.  The act of committing is what could trigger downstream jobs or in itself not be repeatable/recoverable, so we should treat AM crashes during job commit much like we treat non-crashing failures during job commit today, i.e.: it should fail the job without re-running and re-committing.  Worst-case we have a false negative where the output did commit successfully but we thought the job failed, and I agree with Koji that a false negative beats a false positive in this case.\n\nThis means we need a marker noting when we start and stop committing sync'd to the job history file.  If the AM relaunches and finds we crashed during commit, we should treat it as we do a committer failure and fail the job.  If the re-attempt finds we finished committing then we simply need to unregister from the RM without re-running.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-28T21:49:20.715+0000","updated":"2012-11-28T21:49:20.715+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13506330","id":"13506330","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This has ordering issues with MAPREDUCE-4813.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-29T08:53:32.103+0000","updated":"2012-11-29T08:53:32.103+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13506353","id":"13506353","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Just read up the whole wall of comments.

As far as YARN-244 is concerned the comments around the code seem to suggest that it was an explicit decision to cleanup before unregistering. \n\nYes, it was explicitly done as a workaround to ensure the staging directory was cleaned up before the RM shot the AM.  Previously there was a race where the AM was trying to delete the staging directory while the RM was shooting the AM after it unregistered and often the AM lost and the staging directory was left around.  Since then we've added a FINISHING state to allow the AM to cleanup before the RM tries to shoot it.  Given that, we should move the staging directory cleanup back to after we unregister (but not in this JIRA).\n\nbq. I am not quite clear why the commit would be repeated if the job does not execute any task at all?\n\nThe job will only avoid committing if it sees the job completion event written to the history file, but that occurs *after* committing.  Therefore if we commit then crash before we sync that completion event to disk, the second attempt will try to commit again.  And we're seeing a number of cases where the AM crashed after committing but before completing job history.  It should be relatively rare, but it can happen and is happening.\n\nbq. the commit code seems to be user pluggable code. In that case, how can we ensure that every commit implementation can be made into a singleton operation? Can it be as simple as a committer refusing to commit if the output file already exists? Are committers allowed to delete an output file if it exists? In that case how does it differentiate between a checkpointed commit from a previous crashed run vs an old commit from a successful job?\n\nThe committer is user-pluggable code and therefore can do *arbitrary* things.  It doesn't have to be files.  It can be a database commit, an web service transaction, a custom job-end notification mechanism, or whatever.  Therefore we cannot assume the commit is recoverable -- there are reasons why the job fails when the committer says it failed, because we can't retry it.  In the future maybe we can extend the committer API to allow the committer to say it can attempt to recover from a job commit failure, but for now we can't tell.  That's why re-running a commit is Not Good.\n\nbq. On a side note, we should be encouraging projects that depend on output markers for job completion polling, to stop doing that and start using API's. Perhaps in the next version change. Continuing to support these kind of use cases could make solutions more complex and fragile than they need to be.\n\nThe file marker thing is just one committer's way of handling things.  Committers can do *arbitrary* things.  The job doesn't even have to produce output as files, for example.  It's pluggable for a reason, and we can't know or assume what it's doing.  We can only give it interfaces and restrictions (hopefully as few as possible) to govern how it interoperates with the rest of the job framework.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-29T17:41:30.654+0000","updated":"2012-11-29T17:41:30.654+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13506631","id":"13506631","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attaching patch with Hadoop QA test failures fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-29T18:06:43.845+0000","updated":"2012-11-29T18:06:43.845+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13506649","id":"13506649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

FileOutputCommitter optionally will mark a directory as complete with an \"_SUCCESS\" file when the job is committed.  Oozie or other workflow systems can use this to recognize that a job has finished and start processing that output as input to another job.  If we do not couple them there is a race that Oozie may lose.  You are correct that we have to be careful about what processing happens after a job is committed and verify that it can be redone without any problem.  The things that happen here are moving the job history over to where the history server can pick it up, job end notification, unregistering from the RM, and cleaning up the staging directory.\n\nLooking at each of these one at a time:\nFor moving job history over I do need to adopt the change that you made to make it more robust where we copy the log file and do not delete the old one until the staging directory is removed. I also need to make changes to the HistoryServer to allow it to ignore the subsequent JobHistory files for the same job.\n\nFor Job End notification.  This is hitting a URL to indicate that the job has finished and if it has finished successfully or in error.  I do need to do some integration tests with Oozie to validate that it can handle being informed more then once without having any real problems.  The notification is a best effort contract, so in the short term I plan to disable notification if we think that we may double notify (Commit finished and we don't know if we notified or not).  I know Oozie can handle this, but it will delay some processing. We can then explore changing that contract on a separate JIRA.\n\nUnregistering with the RM is by its very nature atomic.  If we crash after unregistering we will not be rerun. \n\nDeleting the staging directory is also guarded against (code commented out in the first patch, but I have fixed the unit tests in and will have it in an upcoming patch).  If for some reason the staging directory was removed and a new AM is launched it will exit with an error.\n\nThe only other code that is part of this patch is the JobHistoryCopyService.  This is kind of a stripped down version of the recovery service for the special case where we are not going to rerun anything, we just want the events to be put into the new history file. We could have copied the old history file over, but it would be missing the section about this new AM.\n\nThis first patch was just to show the concepts.  There is still a fair amount of work to do before it is really ready to commit, so if you have any other suggestions, or potential problems that you see with this approach please point them out.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-02T20:23:58.545+0000","updated":"2013-01-02T20:23:58.545+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13542421","id":"13542421","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This is an updated version of my patch.

This does have the drawback of a small performance hit though - and also makes job history a critical part of a job.\nUsing separate files for marking success / failure - am guessing this is to have a smaller change of a failing persist, as compared to persisting events via the HistoryFile, which may already have a backlog of events ?\n\nWondering if it's possible to achieve the same checks via the CommitterEventHandler instead of checking in the MRAppMaster class. i.e follow the regular recovery path - except the CommitHandler emits success / failed / abort events depending on the presence of these files / (history events).\nAlternately, the current implementation could be simplified by using a custom RMCommunicator - which does not depend on JobImpl. i.e. the history copier and an RMCommunicator to unregister from the RM.\n\nComments on the current patch\n- If the last AM attempt were to crash - data exists since the _SUCCESS_ file exists, RPC will not see SUCCESS.\n- While the new AM is running - it will not be able to handle status, counter etc requests.

Thanks for everyone looking at the patch.\nbq. I had observed that if I made my AM crash (by putting an exit(1) in shutdownJob() then the history files would get orphaned and not cleaned up. Or something like that.\n\nThanks for the heads up. I will look into that.\n\nbq. Why not end in success if the staging dir was cleaned up by the last attempt?\n\nBecause we crashed somewhere after staging was cleaned up and before we unregistered.  Crashing seems like an error to me, but I suppose we could change it.  As for what the client ultimately sees for success or failure, we will rely on the history server to report that.\n\nbq. I am guessing that this code wont be necessary after we move the unregister to RM before the staging dir cleanup in MAPREDUCE-4841, right?\nYes and No.  Once MAPREDUCE-4841 goes in there is an increased possibility of leaking staging directories.  I have seen users in 1.0 blow away their staging directory to clean up, and caused jobs to fail.  Granted they are more likely to get errors from the distributed cache not finding the files it needs, but in either case I would like to be paranoid and guard against that.\n\nbq. Why are we only eating/ignoring the JobEvents in the dispatcher? So that the JobImpl state machine is not triggered?\n\nIn the new code path we have not wired up everything.  JobImpl is created but the JobEventDispatcher is not.  I did not want to have to deal with recovering the complete state of the job.  Which in some cases may not even be possible.  This is also why I am not brining up the RPC server.  Which now that you mention it I probably also need to update the UI/client to deal with that appropriately. The typo you found was just there for debugging this situation.  (I'll fix the typo by the way)\n\nbq. This might be a question of personal preference. I think an explicit transition to from the INIT to final state is cleaner than overriding the state in the getter.\n\nI actually wanted to put in a stubbed out Job instead, but there are too many places that Job is cast to JobImpl just to get the state making it difficult to do so.  I will look again to see if I can split the two apart, or add in a state transition.\n\nbq. Oozie handles duplicate notifications correctly doing a NOP.\nGreat.  I will look at the javadocs for job end notification again to be sure that we can default to notify instead.\n\nbq. Using separate files for marking success / failure - am guessing this is to have a smaller change of a failing persist, as compared to persisting events via the HistoryFile, which may already have a backlog of events?\n\nIt was also a much smaller change to make.  The HistoryFile would be preferable if we wanted to guarantee at most once commit of the tasks, because there are so many of them.\n\nbq. Wondering if it's possible to achieve the same checks via the CommitterEventHandler instead of checking in the MRAppMaster class. i.e follow the regular recovery path - except the CommitHandler emits success / failed / abort events depending on the presence of these files / (history events). \nbq. Alternately, the current implementation could be simplified by using a custom RMCommunicator - which does not depend on JobImpl. i.e. the history copier and an RMCommunicator to unregister from the RM.\nBoth of those seem like valid things to investigate.  I feel like I am close on this and want to get this working as is first and then I will look at the other approaches you suggested.  I do like the first one as it seems like it would be a lot simpler to implement, but I want a backup that I know functions before making drastic changes to the design.\n\nbq. If the last AM attempt were to crash - data exists since the SUCCESS file exists, RPC will not see SUCCESS.\nWe have a lot of problems in general if the last AM were to crash.  It is possible that the history server would have no knowledge of the job what so ever even if it finished successfully.  This patch is not attempting to address those problems.\n\nbq. While the new AM is running - it will not be able to handle status, counter etc requests. This seems a little problematic if a success has been reported over RPC from the previous AM. Since this AM is dealing with the history file - could possibly have it return information from the history file ? History commit before SUCCESS may help with the previous 2 points.\n\nYes History commit before returning success would help with those problems. I will look into it as an alternative approach.  my initial thought was to update the client/UI to wait for the AM to report a valid address so that no client is trying to get counters etc from an AM in this situation.\n\nbq. If the recovered AppMaster is not the last retry - looks like the RM unregistration will not happen. (isLastAMRetry)\nisLastAMRetry is set in a number of places, including in the init method if we notice that the previous Job ended but the AM crashed.\n\nbq. Is a KILLED status also required - KILLED during commit should not be reported as FAILED.\nThat would be nice.  We would have to put it in as part of CommiterEventHandler.cancelJobCommit(). I will look into that.\n\nbq. CommitEventHandler.touchz could throw an exception if the file already exists - to prevent lost AMs from committing. (maybe not required after MAPREDUCE-4832 ?)\nI think it already will.  We are not opening the file for append, we are trying to create it.\n\nbq. historyService creation - can move into the common if (copyHistory) check\nOK\n\nbq. Don't think \"AMStartedEvent\" cannot be ignored - the history server will have no info about past AMs. I think only the current AM needs to be ignored.\n\nThe AMStartedEvent is ignored by the copy service but not by the MRAppMaster.  The MRAppMaster will read the history file just like it did before and extract the AMStartedEvents, it will add in another one for itself, and then the copyHistoryService will read the rest of the history file.\n\nbq. Wondering if it's possible to use HDFS dirs and timestamps to co-ordinate between an active AM and lost AMs.\nAlso, are hdfs dir operations cheaper than file create operations (NN only / NN +DN) ? Nor sure if mkdir / 0 length file creation are NN only ops.\n\nI thought that they were NN only ops, but I will check with an HDFS person to know for sure.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-03T16:22:08.883+0000","updated":"2013-01-03T16:22:08.883+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13543267","id":"13543267","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"This patch should be fully functional.\n\nI have included the work by Bikas to put the Job history file in a location that is deleted with the staging directory.  I have fixed a few bugs in the original where we were not registering with the RM correctly.  And also where the Web App Proxy would return a 500 error if hit when recovery was happening.\n\nI have manually tested this by having the AM exit/halt before, during, and after job commit.  I tested it with the job commit failing and succeeding.  Everything appears to be working as expected.\n\nI did not change JobImpl forcedState because adding in the transitions was more then I wanted to do right now.  I am happy to file a follow up JIRA to make those changes if we want them.\n\nI have also not added in the kill state.  Again it looked a bit tricky because of the multithreading and I would prefer to get something working in now and add that as part of a follow up JIRA.\n\nI talked with Kihwal Lee about the extra HDFS load for an empty file vs a directory and he said about the only extra load is the extra PRC call to close it, and because it is just two files per job I left it as is.  If you feel strongly about it I can fix it on a separate JIRA.\n\nAbout the only thing that is left for this is integration with MAPREDUCE-4832.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-03T20:49:39.319+0000","updated":"2013-01-03T20:49:39.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12617668/comment/13543297","id":"13543297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
