Hadoop 0.20.204 reducers does not goes OOM, I have seen this in Hadoop.Next only.\nThat is right, Karam. We would ideally want YARN+MR to be able to run with the same configuration. Unfortunately mrv2 reduce runtime has changed a lot, and it performs better in so many other situations but worse in this particular case. The implementation has changed in such a way that supporting 0.7 is not possible with the current set of jobs in gridmix without running into OOM.\n\nI agree that it is a regression but for now this should be fine.
