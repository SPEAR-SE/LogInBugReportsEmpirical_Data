This breaks oozie, as oozie expects to be able to get that information quickly and get back to processing other requests.\n\nBecause the web app proxy is now available we can maintain backwards compatibility by instead of returning N/A we can return the URL of the proxy for that application.  This relies on the fact that the application master's UI will display the correct thing for the URI http://<host>:<port>/, which MR and others now
