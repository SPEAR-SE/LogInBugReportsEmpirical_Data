I think the test failures are unrelated\n 1. testConcurrentJobs is failing because one file is not detected as corrupt and so block fixer does not fix it. This seems to be intermittent, since I tried running the test and it succeeded twice. I dont think this is related to federation. Perhaps we can track it separately?\n 2. testFileBlockAndParityBlockMissingHar2 failed because of insufficient heap space when running a HAR job through LocalJobRunner. Again, unrelated to federation\n 3. testJobQueues - Failed because of a timeout. Also, RAID changes cannot affect core mapred tests, so this must be unrelated.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rvadali","name":"rvadali","key":"rvadali","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ramkumar Vadali","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-10T20:24:15.267+0000","updated":"2011-05-10T20:24:15.267+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12505997/comment/13031871","id":"13031871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Ramkumar for the feedback.
