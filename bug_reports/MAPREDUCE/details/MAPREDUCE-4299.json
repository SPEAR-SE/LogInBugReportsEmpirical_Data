So what could be happening is that the allocator slowly ramps up the number of reducers until they use up 32768 MB (32 slots at 1024MB apiece) thinking that there is still memory available when there isn't. The code has some confusion between the terms 'available resource', 'headroom', and 'cluster resource' - i.e. it's not clear if available resource is a total, or just what's not in use. RMContainerAllocator.getMemLimit() suggests the latter, while the FifoScheduler has the line {{application.setHeadroom(clusterResource)}} which suggests that it's a fixed total.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2012-05-31T20:43:58.767+0000","updated":"2012-05-31T20:43:58.767+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12558861/comment/13411125","id":"13411125","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"The problem is that FifoScheduler always sets the application headroom to be the entire set of cluster resources, without taking into account any containers that have been assigned.
