It showed the same bug.\n\n{{\n{quote}\nHBase mapreduce and ResourceEstimator\n\nDmitry Chechik\nWed, 24 Mar 2010 13:27:08 -0700\n\nHi all,\n\nWe have an issue that occasionally crops up in the following scenario:\n1. We have a fairly small HBase table. (say 400M)\n2. We have a larger set of input from HDFS (say 1G bytes)\n\nWe run a mapreduce that joins this input (i.e., some of the mappers read\nfrom HDFS, and some read from HBase).\nThe mappers that read from HBase all have TableSplits, which return 0 for\ngetLength().\nThe HDFS mappers have a non-zero getLength(), which is roughly the file size\nof the HDFS input.\n\nBecause of this, the total input size of the job is roughly the size of the\nHDFS input. Since the HBase table is small, the HBase mappers often finish\nfirst. In that case, ResourceEstimator thinks that completedMapsInputSize is\nnear 0 (actually, it's equal to the number of HBase mapper tasks, which is\non the order of 10s for us.), but the completedMapsOutputSize is fairly\nlarge (since it's the actual bytes output by the HBase reducers). So, the\nResourceEstimator thinks that the estimated total map output size is\nroughly:\n\ninputSize * completedMapsOutputSize * 2 / completedMapsInputSize\n= (1G) * (400M * 2) / (32)\n\nSo the total estimated map output size is very large and the HDFS tasks wind\nup pending, because we don't have enough resources.\n\nHas anyone else run into this? One solution would be if TableSplit would\nreturn a reasonable estimate of the size of each split, instead of 0, but it\nlooks like this isn't possible right now.\n\n- Dmitry\n{quote}\n}}","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mry.maillist","name":"mry.maillist","key":"mry.maillist","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ruyue Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-04-02T09:24:21.786+0000","updated":"2010-04-02T09:24:21.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12461006/comment/12853317","id":"12853317","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mry.maillist","name":"mry.maillist","key":"mry.maillist","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ruyue Ma","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A suggestion:\n\nAccording the completed maps, we get the average mapOutputSize  = CompletedMapsOutputSize / CompletedMapsNum.
