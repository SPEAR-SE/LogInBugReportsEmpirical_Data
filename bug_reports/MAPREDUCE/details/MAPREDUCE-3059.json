Minimal processing and communication overhead on the cluster.\n2. Addition of more metrics in future\n3. Configurable - e.g. OnDemand-admin should be to trigger it from resource manager web UI. or periodic refresh\n\nfollowing two solutions i could think of. \n\nSolution 1:\nEither we can provide a configuration or a link On the ResourceManager UI or through jmx trigger point, we can provide a way to trigger the gathering of metrics from each node manager.\nIt involves a service on ResourceManager side, which can be a RPC service, which will accept metrics update requests from all NodeManagers.\nWhen Administrator triggers the gathering of metrics, the NodeManager will be informed to report the metrics to ResourceManager through the heart beat response.\n\nSolution 2:\nResourceManager, NodeManager, MRAppMaster everyone bydefault support for org.apache.hadoop.metrics.MetricsServlet which returns the data in JSON format.\nResourceManager can have a service which connects to all NodeManager's MetricsSevlet and uses the JSON data to prepare the metrics information.\n\nplease add your views.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj.k","name":"devaraj.k","key":"devaraj.k","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj K","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-11T16:27:24.995+0000","updated":"2011-10-11T16:27:24.995+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523864/comment/13125331","id":"13125331","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Devaraj,\n Why cant we just calculate these metrics in the RM itself?
