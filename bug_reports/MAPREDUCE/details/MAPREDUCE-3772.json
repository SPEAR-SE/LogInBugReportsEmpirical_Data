FileOutputFormats, to handle speculative execution, write the output to the following path *$mapred.out.dir/\\_temporary/\\_$taskid* while execution. If speculative execution is in progress for a given task, there will be 2 tasks IDs for it, this means that while the 'competing' tasks are running their outputs go to different directories. When the first speculative task completes, its output will be committed (moved to the *$mapred.out.dir*) and the second speculative task will be discarded, as well as its output. MultipleOutputs creates the named outputs under the *_$taskid* directory, thus leveraging all the speculative execution functionality and behavior implemented by FileOutputFormat. If the named output file is not within the *_$taskid* directory, then all the logic just described does not work as the task commit procedure is done only from the *_$taskid* directory to the *$mapred.out.dir*.\n\nBecause of this I think that Priyo suggestion of logging a warning makes sense.
