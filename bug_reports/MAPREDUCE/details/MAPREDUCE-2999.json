The yarn Webapp can then pass in the path specifications they are going to service when creating the httpserver (ie /yarn, /yarn*).  We should make sure all WebApps have a name/base serve path spec so that it doesn't mess up any of the other servlets.  ie should be of the format <host:port>/somename/*\n\nThis is a bit ugly but I think it would potentially mess up other existing apps if we were to add the filter for /*.  All of them currently have a name anyway.  Since many of the yarn UI's currently don't append the /somename to the uri's in links (like in the RM nodes page) and just have host:port, I am making it redirect anything from host:port/ to the registered webapp name host:port/somename.

Since guice has the \"/\" registered guice hijacks it and tries to dispatch it on its own and the logs servlet never gets it back.\n\nNow I changed the pathSpec on the /logs to /* (logContext.addServlet(AdminAuthorizedServlet.class, \"/*\")).  Then the guice filter doesn't hijack it and logs is served up.  I don't quite understand why this works as I would have thought the pathSpec being served was still \"/\" and guice filter would have grabbed it.  Any servlet experts out there that can explain that?\n\nAnother option might be to not have guice register \"/\" and have an index.html that redirects it similar to how jobtracker and namenode do now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-20T20:55:51.319+0000","updated":"2011-09-20T20:55:51.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522924/comment/13109173","id":"13109173","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I filed HADOOP-7662 to fix the issue with /logs.  That does mean that we could just register \"/\" instead of doing the redirect.  However I think the redirect makes it easier for filters to differentiate urls.  This goes along with MAPREDUCE-3021.  If we allow all the webapps to use host:port/ then the filters have no way of differentiation rm from nm from am, etc. The redirect would allow the filters to work as well as still allow you to go to host:port/.

When filter setting is set verified that the load of each page properly went through the filter specified. When going through the filter the page properly showed the current User in the upper right hand corner.  Without the filter it shows the default hadoop user of \"dr.who\".  Modified my auth filter to be able to choose which pages to actually authenticate and which not to.  When it didn't authenticate pages verified that anyone could go there and the upper right corner was empty (didn't show the \"Logged in as:\").\n\nTested that all the yarn web pages and links from yarn web pages to other pages worked.  For instance RM page has link to node manager, links from app to job history and to app master.  Verified the links from app master back to RM work,  etc... and that when the filter is there they properly go through the filter and ask for authentication.\n\nVerify that each yarn web app allows the user to get there from:\n  - host:port/         ->  This redirects you to host:port/yarn so that the filter can differentiate and chose to authenticate or not\n  - host:port/yarn     -> goes to default page specified by webapp\n  - host:port/yarn/*   -> goes to page specified by webapp\n\nVerify that all of the default applications registered in HttpServer still work.
