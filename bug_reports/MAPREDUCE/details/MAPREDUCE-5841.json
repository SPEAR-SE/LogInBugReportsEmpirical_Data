As a result, the key event (CONTAINER_REMOTE_CLEANUP) sits in the queue until the mapper/reducer task finishes.\n\nI think a possible fix is to separate the event handling and the task running into their own threads respectively.

Now that there could be, I think we would want to track the Future for each task submitted that's in-flight and attempt to cancel the running task when the cleanup event is received.\n- The System.exit call should be ExitUtil.terminate instead, as it allows unit tests to disable the system exit in case something goes wrong during the test or to verify exit behavior if that's desired.\n- Speaking of unit tests, it'd be nice to verify the LocalContainerLauncher is able to respond to events while a long-running sleep task is executing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-22T14:54:34.557+0000","updated":"2014-04-22T14:54:34.557+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708982/comment/13976959","id":"13976959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the review [~jlowe]!\n\nI am almost done with a unit test, and am going to update the patch to include it soon. Yes, that's the approach I took (although it took a fair amount of mocking). With the test, you can easily reproduce the bug against the existing code, and confirm the fix.\n\nbq. The System.exit call should be ExitUtil.terminate instead, as it allows unit tests to disable the system exit in case something goes wrong during the test or to verify exit behavior if that's desired.\n\nGood point.

In fact, that's the very first approach I took, but when I ran the TestUberAM unit tests, interestingly it resulted in all unit tests hanging indefinitely. I spent some time to try to figure out why it was hanging but wasn't successful.\n\nAnyhow, the reason I arrived at the current fix is that once the state transition is completed, LocalContainerLauncher.stop() is invoked, and that shuts down the ExecutorService for the task runner. And that shut down interrupts any running task. So the end result is pretty much the same.\n\nLet me know what you think.

Since we fake the exit of the \"container\" the AM will attempt to re-launch the task, the new task attempt will get submitted to the executor queue, but I think it hangs in the queue waiting for the stuck task since it's only executing one task at a time.  At that point the only recourse is to kill the entire job.\n\nIf you could poke at it a bit more I think it'd be good to understand what's going on if we cancel the task.  If it proves particularly sticky then we can consider putting this in and filing a followup JIRA to track the remaining fail-task/kill-task issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-22T16:20:52.460+0000","updated":"2014-04-22T16:20:52.460+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12708982/comment/13977047","id":"13977047","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"That's a good point.
