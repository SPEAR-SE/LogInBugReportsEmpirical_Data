We captured the details of this exception by logging the stack trace in the catch block.\nHere is what the stack trace looks like:\norg.apache.hadoop.util.Shell$ExitCodeException: bash: /local4/1_0_3/hadoop-local/ttprivate/taskTracker/root/jobcache/job_201206081243_0001/attempt_201206081243_0001_m_000024_0/taskjvm.sh: Text file busy\n\n        at org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell.runCommand(Shell.java:255)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell.run(Shell.java:182)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.util.Shell$ShellCommandExecutor.execute(Shell.java:375)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.DefaultTaskController.launchTask(DefaultTaskController.java:131)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JvmManager$JvmManagerForType$JvmRunner.runChild(JvmManager.java:498)\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JvmManager$JvmManagerForType$JvmRunner.run(JvmManager.java:472)\n\nAlso, all the log/work files corresponding to the failed tasks get cleaned up and hence it becomes harder to debug the underlying cause.\n\nAbove patch has helped reduce these failures, however, they still occur. I am not sure whether the \"Text file busy\" exception is a Hadoop issue or some other issue though. I just thought sharing this information here would benefit someone.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jshrinivas","name":"jshrinivas","key":"jshrinivas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shrinivas Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-06-08T20:51:52.203+0000","updated":"2012-06-08T20:51:52.203+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500950/comment/13292071","id":"13292071","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Hi Shrinivas,\n\nYes, I still see them on very rare occasion, though I don't have a good explanation as to why.

(I'll post another comment relevant to SElinux.)\n\nThe ETXTBSY error code from execve(2) happens when the executable (in this case, a shell script) is still opened for write by another process.  Reading the kernel code there does not appear to be any chance for a \"slight delay\"; when the writer calls close() the atomic {{inode->i_readcount}} is decremented, and {{open_exec()}} correctly tests the atomic against zero.\n\nSo I strongly suspect that the writer does, in fact, still have the filedescriptor open for write when the execve happens.\n\nI don't see how that's possible, though -- we clearly call {{w.close()}} in the {{finally}} clause of {{writeCommand}}, and I don't see anywhere that we leak a {{FileDescriptor}} to prevent {{FileOutputStream#close}} from triggering the underlying {{close(2)}}.\n\nBut...\n\nWe can avoid the {{ETXTBSY}} by avoiding the {{execve}}.  If I'm reading {{launchTask}} correctly, the script we're execing isn't even a valid shell script anyways -- it's just a sequence of shell commands, without the leading \"#!/bin/sh\" header.  By running it {{bash -c \"/path/to/script\"}} we're relying on the ancient pre-Bourne shell script convention that if execve() fails with {{ENOEXEC}}, the shell tries to interpret the file as a script.\n\nInstead, we can ask bash to directly run the script as a script by running {{bash \"/path/to/script\"}} leaving out the {{-c}}.  This avoids the code path that triggers the ETXTBSY failure and is slightly less reliant on random backwards compatibility kludges.  And it doesn't break if we do have the {{#!/bin/sh}} line since that's just a comment.\n\nNow, suppose the undiscovered but hypothesized race condition in {{writeCommand}} does exist, and affects the {{write}} as well as the {{close}}.  Then removing {{-c}} does not remove the race, and when we lose the race the failure will probably be more silent.  The command file might not be completely written and running the script might fail.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-23T19:04:13.740+0000","updated":"2012-07-23T19:04:13.740+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500950/comment/13420883","id":"13420883","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. in the case of exceptions being thrown, the FileChannel is not closed.\n\nAh, but in this case the caller doesn't catch that exception, so we wouldn't have gotten to the {{shExec.execute()}} if {{writeCommand}}'s invocation of {{w.close()}} had thrown.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-23T19:13:50.219+0000","updated":"2012-07-23T19:13:50.219+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500950/comment/13420888","id":"13420888","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=adi2","name":"adi2","key":"adi2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Isaacson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

I assume that the sync() method calls fsync sys call which will ensure that the data is committed to the underlying storage.\n\nI have noticed ENOEXEC errors for both successful as well as unsuccessful (ETXTBSY) cases of bash -c /path/to/taskjvm.sh calls through strace output.

We'll also need to look at the equivalent code in trunk (MR2), since it probably has the same issue.\n\nNice work, everyone, tracking down this long-standing bug.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2012-07-25T20:15:37.504+0000","updated":"2012-07-25T20:15:37.504+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12500950/comment/13422618","id":"13422618","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jshrinivas","name":"jshrinivas","key":"jshrinivas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Shrinivas Joshi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Todd, thanks for clarifying my concerns with sync.

It's very odd to have MAPREDUCE jira numbers in hadoop-yarn-project/CHANGES.txt.\n\nSorry, Arun. I didn't quite know what to do with this since this JIRA was opened long before YARN was split off from MR. When committing, I also noticed that there is some precedent for having a MAPREDUCE JIRA entry in the YARN CHANGES.txt (MAPREDUCE-4323) and so thought it was OK. I agree that putting a MAPREDUCE jira in the YARN CHANGES.txt is odd, but opening a separate JIRA just so we have a new number for putting in CHANGES.txt also seemed odd to me.
