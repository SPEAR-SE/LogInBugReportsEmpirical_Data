Should we remove it ?\nIt seems to be an interface method and could be usable to support adaptive scheduling decisions based on load pressure in the future.

There is one point I wanted to bring to attention, and would appreciate a second look:\n\nThe patch introduces a locking order of queue manager, and then scheduler. This is in the refreshQueues call in CapacitySchedulerQueueRefresher. There is a locking of the scheduler and then the queue manager, when the scheduler calls setSchedulerInfo in createDisplayInfo. At the face of it, this seems like a cyclic lock order with a potential to create a deadlock. \n\nOn closer look, I think the two code paths cannot be active at the same time. The call to refreshQueues can happen only when a refreshQueues command is fired, and right now, that can happen only via an RPC call to the JobTracker. The call to setSchedulerInfo happens only at startup time, and this happens *before* the InterTrackerServer is started. \n\nSo, the patch seems safe still.

So I suppose the right order of locking should be \"task scheduler\" -> \"queue manager\". To get that correct, it seems we can fix it by having JobTracker to lock task scheduler before it calls anything in queue manager that could call back to task scheduler - for now there is only one such call site which is refreshQueues().

On the other hand, does anybody know how frequently would the queue structure be refreshed?\n\nVery infrequently, compared to the other competing operations like heartbeats.\n\nbq. If not very frequent, the main overhead of the implementation is to tie up one thread waiting for the task scheduler lock, and I'd tend to think it is acceptable.\n\nTypical implementations of scheduling lock the task scheduler (i.e. the assignTasks call in the scheduler). Hence, when the queue refresh is triggered, all heartbeats will be locked. At least that is the case with the capacity scheduler.\n\nStill, given how infrequent this is going to be (and also a typical queueRefresh operation is very fast) I think I am fine with this approach. If there are no other objections, let us go ahead. Makes sense ?\n\nThat said, looking at the latest changes, I did not quite follow why you introduced a new static refreshQueues method. The callers of this (apart from the non-static method in JobTracker) are in test cases. All these tests have a scheduler instance. We could lock it and then call the QueueManager API to be consistent. So it seems that the static method is an unnecessary indirection. Am I missing something ?\n\nbq. Findbugs still warns about the inconsistent synchronization and I have to exclude them in findbugsExcludeFile.xml.\n\nI suppose this is because FindBugs does not realize the taskScheduler instance on which we are locking in the refreshQueues is the same instance which is locked in the other usages of this variable. So, this seems a valid reason to add to the exclude file.  Do you think it makes sense to document this rationale in the excludes file so there is context ? BTW, thanks for updating the API documentation of the refreshQueues contract in TaskScheduler.
