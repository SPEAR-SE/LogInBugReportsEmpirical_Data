Ideally applications should never construct or parse TaskID strings, but where that is not possible, one should use the appropriate constructors which provide all the information or the forName API. For e.g, even if we fix this, toString will print the wrong ID (the default).\n\nI just saw HIVE-4216, the comment by Andrey [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4216?focusedCommentId=13848792&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13848792] seems like a reasonable solution.\n\nThere are far too many empty constructors like this in all of Hadoop that aren't expected to be used directly.
