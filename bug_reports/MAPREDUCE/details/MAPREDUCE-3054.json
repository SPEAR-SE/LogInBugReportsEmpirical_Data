Some questions and comments on the approach itself.\n - With the patch, YarnRunner sends a kill to AM and also a killJob signal to RM in *all* cases. So in all the cases, AM may not be able to gracefully kill itself and write the history file. Absence of history file for all the killed jobs is a broken user experience IMHO. I think we should force-kill on the RM side only when needed.\n    -- The implementation could be something like this: Check the Application state on RM, if it is running, send a kill-signal to the AM otherwise force-terminate on the RM. Sure, there are corner cases where the client obtains a non-running state, but by the time it sends a force-terminate signal, the app may become running, but losing the (little) information in those rare cases should be bearable.\n - Also jobs which are in the queue and get killed have no record in the system( ! ) (except for the fleeting cache in RM). I can't think of any solution other than MAPREDUCE-3061.\n - I am tending to rename _ClientRMProtocol.finishApplication()_ to _ClientRMProtocol.forceTerminateApplication()_ to better reflect its semantics.

I dont think we can get away from not sending kill to the RM at all times. I dont think we can rely on AM to be responsive and do the right work. Thoughts?\nI agree with the general sentiment here. But the way I'd handle this is by having different UI for graceful-kill and force-terminate: \"bin/hadoop job -kill\" will do the usual graceful exit. If someone intends to do a \"bin/hadoop job -kill -force\", they know the risks (of not getting history file, notification etc).\n\nIn a way, we are arguing SIGTERM vs SIGKILL semantics here. Sure someone may trap SIGTERM, but SIGTERM only promises a graceful exit if the process is willing to. Otherwise, you go use SIGKILL. We don't need the framework to wrap around SIGTERM and SIGKILL.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-26T17:16:56.286+0000","updated":"2011-09-26T17:16:56.286+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523798/comment/13114998","id":"13114998","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Ok, here's a compromise.
