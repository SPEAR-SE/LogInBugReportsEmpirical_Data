Here is basically what I am planning implementing:\n\n- yarn acls/application acls are separate from mapreduce acls.  They only control what a user can view/modify on the RM.  This include the admins as well. So yarn.admins do not apply to AM/history server.  \n\n- mapreduce job acls are put into application acls when application is submitted (this didn't change)\n\n- the mapreduce application master and mapreduce job history server purely use the mapreduce job acls - this includes mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled, mapreduce.cluster.administrators, acl-view-job, and acl-modify-job.\n\nThis separates out yarn from mapreduce so that someone could be admin for mapreduce without being yarn admin and when other apps are ported to yarn, they can be separate too.  The reason I don't have yarn admins apply to job history server is because the job history server is a mapreduce only component and shouldn't be looking at the yarn configs.\n\nThe only problem with this still is it appears the AM and job history server are using the job configuration so the user can override the settings - this is bad!! I need to investigate that more.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-02-27T23:30:29.072+0000","updated":"2012-02-27T23:30:29.072+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543865/comment/13218599","id":"13218599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I was unable to get rid of the inconsistencies without major rework.

Looks good. One minor nit - the debug log should be within an if debug enabled check.\nNot necessarily related to this patch - yarn has ACLs enabled by default, MR has them disabled by default. That can lead to strange behavior considering some of the calls like killJob use Yarn ACLs, while getJobStatus will use MR ACLs. The Yarn ACLs could be disabled by default as well.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-02-29T02:44:46.873+0000","updated":"2012-02-29T02:44:46.873+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543865/comment/13219243","id":"13219243","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks for the review Sid.  I'll update the patch with the debug call changed.

They all go through the invoke->getProxy() path which gets an application report, which does the yarn acl checks. \n\nBut yes if yarn acls are on and mapred acls are off, it will still check yarn acls and enforce them when viewing/killing a mapred job via the cli, but if you go through the web apps it won't check acls because it only uses the mapred acls.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-02-29T14:34:55.137+0000","updated":"2012-02-29T14:34:55.137+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543865/comment/13219280","id":"13219280","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"updates from review.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-02-29T15:28:37.223+0000","updated":"2012-02-29T15:28:37.223+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12543865/comment/13219330","id":"13219330","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
