This helps cut duplicate code in removeJobTasks and would also be useful if task types change in future.\n- Rather than enumerate the task types in the javadoc of getTaskType, I would suggest we expand on the details of what is returned without actually enumerating all the task types. Basically, it is clear this API should return the task type of a task, depending on the nature of the task rather than on the task attempt id. This way we wouldn't need to worry too much about keeping the comment in sync.\n- \"Get task-attempt-ids for all the tasks.\" - Seems incorrect for getAllTaskIDs. It should be \"Get all {@link TaskAttemptID}s for a given {@link TaskInProgress}\". In fact, maybe as you suggested the API can also be changed to getAllTaskAttemptIDs to be more correct.\n- I am a little worried we are returning the data structure 'tasks' directly to the caller of getAllTaskIDs.

I have a few comments:\n\n- Thinking a little more if we can address my concern about decoupling knowledge of task types and the removeJobTasks API,  can we refactor the code in removeJobTasks as follows:\n\n{code}\nJobInProgress {\n  Map<TaskType, TaskInProgress[]> getAllTIPsByType() {\n    Map<TaskType, TaskInProgress[]> tipsByType =\n      new HashMap<TaskType, TaskInProgress[]>();\n    tipsByType.put(TaskType.SETUP, getSetupTasks());\n    ...\n  }\n}\n\nJobTracker {\n\n  removeJobTasks() {\n    Map<TaskType, TaskInProgress[]> tipsByType = \n      job.getAllTIPsByType();\n    for (TaskInProgress[] allTIPs : tipsByType.values()) {\n      for (TaskInProgress tip : allTIPs) {\n        for (TaskAttemptID id : tip.getAllTaskAttemptIDs()) {\n          removeTaskEntry(id);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nI feel this has the benefits of keeping knowledge of task types in the JIP, and also removing the duplication of code in removeJobTasks. Thoughts ?\n\n- I think we can enhance the mock test in TestJobRetire to add all types of tasks so that all loops of removeJobTasks are covered.\n- Further, it seems to me like the mock test is a regression test as well. As the status is not set for the task attempts you add, doesn't it mean that the old code would actually leave behind entries in the map reproducing the leak ? If yes, I suppose we can keep the end to end test using MiniMR temporarily until MAPREDUCE-1154 is addressed. But after that, I would assume such a test makes a lot more sense following approaches mentioned in MAPREDUCE-1154. We can inject altering behavior (like aborting the heartbeat, etc) in a more conventional manner.

This patch incorporates review comments from Hemanth and Arun.

Note that the findbugs cribbed on the _getTasks(TaskType)_ change with IS2_INCONSISTENT_SYNC warning. This error occurs because except _getTasks(TaskType)_, all the task arrays (i.e maps, reduces, setup, cleanup) are accessed inside JobInProgress lock.

The log changes are such that one log-line indicating task removal will be printed once per task. This is in sync with the task addition log-line and hence any mismatch in task adding and removal log-lines should point to a memory leak. This is not true today as the task removal log-line is printed in removeMarkedTasks() (caller of removeTaskEntry(), the api responsible for removing a task) which is not called for every task thats got added to the JobTracker. The log lines introduced are not in some loop and will be printed only once per task attempt. \n\nbq. The bug you point to is irrelevant in the current context i.e. JobInProgress.getTasks(TaskType) - '==' or equals is the right implementation.\nLooks like hadoop.io serializes enum as strings hence the jvm bug I pointed out doesnt hold here.\n----\nMAPREDUCE-1316 was raised because there was a mismatch between task-attempt addition and task-attempt removal in the JobTracker. The problem was that once the job retires, the job tasks are removed based on the statuses available.  But task-status is added for a task-attempt only when the tasktracker returns back (once a task is assigned) with the next heartbeat. But there is a corner case in the removal logic.  If the tasktracker is assigned a task and the job finishes, then the newly scheduled attempt will be added to the JobTracker but will not be removed as its status is not yet available. This patch changes the task-removal logic by iterating over all the scheduled/launched attempt-ids instead of statuses thus taking care of the corner case mentioned above.

He used jmap and jobtracker logs to verify the memory leak.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-01-14T06:28:18.698+0000","updated":"2010-01-14T06:28:18.698+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12443741/comment/12800244","id":"12800244","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching a patch for trunk. test-patch failed on findbugs for the reasons mentioned above.
