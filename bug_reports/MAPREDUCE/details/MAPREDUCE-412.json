If not, why not?\n  - setNum*Tasks: is this per TaskTracker? or something else?\n  - methods that take a Path: what if the path is relative?\n  - setWorkingDirectory: is this deleted at the end of a job?  should it be local or dfs?\n  - *KeepFailedTaskFiles: if they are kept, where can they be found?\n  - *KeepTaskFilesPattern: what does \"the files\" mean? if they are kept, where can they be found?\n  - deleteLocalFiles: undoubtedly a risky operation.
