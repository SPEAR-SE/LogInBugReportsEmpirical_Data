The new TaskAttemptContextImpl doesn't know about reporter even though the old org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskAttemptContextImpl knows about it.\n - progress() calls are made throughout, but they may be getting reported because either the calls are made on the the old context object (in Task) or directly on the old Reporter class (in Shuffle etc). So, no bug here as of now, but once we try switching to new API context objects in the implementation of Task etc, we may encounter new bugs.\n - setStatus() on the new context object are made in several RecordReaders - from the code, it seems these status updates will not get reported because of the lack of reporter.\n - New Mapper/Reducer classes also make setStatus() calls but on TaskInputOutputContextImpl which, though knows about the reporter, doesn't override the method from TaskAttemptContextImpl. This will be fixed by the current patch.\n\nMay be, then, the correct and complete solution is to let TaskAttemptContextImpl know about reporter (via constructor), do setStatus() and progress() in TaskAttemptContextImpl itself and not override them in TaskInputOutputContextImpl? This will be slightly more changes, so we can confirm from someone who knows this area well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-08-06T08:54:10.444+0000","updated":"2010-08-06T08:54:10.444+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12468324/comment/12896014","id":"12896014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I agree with Vinod on the above comment that TaskAttemptContextImpl should know about reporter.\n\nAlso, reporter methods in TaskInputOutputContext i.e getCounter() methods should be moved to TaskAttemptContext interface.
