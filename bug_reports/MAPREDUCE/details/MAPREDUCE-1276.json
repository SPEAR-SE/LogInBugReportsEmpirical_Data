Connection logic is wrong as the jira description says. So, both connect timeout and read timeout are treated as read timeout now.\nSolution: Separate connect() and getInputStream() into different blocks as in pre-0.21.\n\n2. If there is connect or read timeout during draining the input stream of the connection, the reducer fails.\nSolution : If there is any timeout here, we should ignore and let the reducer run.\n\n3. If a tracker ran map tasks 1, 2, 3 and  tracker times out reading the output of 2nd task, the reducer penalizes the 1st task. This is because the reducer tries to read all the three map outputs in one connection. \nSolution: After reading every map output, we should do a flush() so that the correct map will be penalized for any error.\n\n4. If a successful task is marked as FAILED because of \"Too many fetch failures\", the task is not removed from reduce.Fetcher's known pending maps. So, reducer will indefinitely try to read the FAILED map.\nSolution: EventFetcher does not add FAILED/KILLED TaskCompletionEvents to obsolete maps. We should add them also as we did in pre-0.21.\n\nAttached patch fixes all the above bugs.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-04-14T08:35:05.786+0000","updated":"2010-04-14T08:35:05.786+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442836/comment/12857263","id":"12857263","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Test output from hudson's console :\n     [exec] \n     [exec] -1 overall.

While this prevents the connection from being reused, it will still be garbage collected if it is simply closed, right? The current code prevents another Fetcher from fetching output from that host while the socket is \"drained,\" which seems like an avoidable cost. Leaving the TCP connection open is regrettable... thoughts on this tradeoff?\n\n* If retained, would it be possible to update the comment on the drain code? The current explanation, \"just in case\", makes it sound like superstition instead of a deliberate choice\n* Since {{input.close()}} can also throw, would it make sense to do that within the try/catch or use {{IOUtils::cleanup}}?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-05-04T21:35:52.558+0000","updated":"2010-05-04T21:35:52.558+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12442836/comment/12864134","id":"12864134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jothipn","name":"jothipn","key":"jothipn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jothi Padmanabhan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"While I added the \"drain\" code, we were debugging some issues with length corruption, which have since been attributed to some bad jdk version (u13 IIRC).
