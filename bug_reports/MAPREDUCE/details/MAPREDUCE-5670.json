Couple of things on the latest patch:\n\n* We should not loop for the record reader next() to return false.  Since we explicitly set up a bunch of empty files it should return false with only one invocation (we should assert for this), and progress should still be called a total of 3 times.  If it somehow doesn't return false in the first invocation then something is wrong, and continuing to loop is inviting a hung test if for some reason it never does return false. ;-)\n* outDir should be unique between the two tests or we risk having them collide if the tests are run in parallel.  I suggest something like TestCombineFileRecordReader.class.getName() which will be different between the two tests.\n* Rather than loop to explicitly delete the individual files, we should just call FileUtil.fullyDelete on outDir.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-01-23T23:47:53.095+0000","updated":"2014-01-23T23:47:53.095+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12682956/comment/13881338","id":"13881338","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=airbots","name":"airbots","key":"airbots","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730"},"displayName":"Chen He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jlowe]\n \nPatch has been updated following your suggestion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=airbots","name":"airbots","key":"airbots","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=airbots&avatarId=34730"},"displayName":"Chen He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-01-24T19:26:19.099+0000","updated":"2014-01-24T19:26:19.099+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12682956/comment/13881722","id":"13881722","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
