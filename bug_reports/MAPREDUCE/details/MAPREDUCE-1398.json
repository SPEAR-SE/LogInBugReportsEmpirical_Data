So, it continues to wait for the killed task to get sufficient slots. If slots do not become free for a long time, this would result in considerable delay in waking up the TaskLauncher thread. If the waiting task happens to be a high RAM task, then it is also wasteful, because by waking up, it can make way for normal tasks that can run on the available number of
