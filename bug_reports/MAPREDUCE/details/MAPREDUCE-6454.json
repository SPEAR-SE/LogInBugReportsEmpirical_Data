The original problem was tracked at MAPREDUCE-5490 for Hadoop 1, which didn't go in. Essentially, things like hive running as part of Oozie actions do not get the distributed-cache files in their classpath.\n - In Hadoop 1, the MapReduce child wouldn't set CLASSPATH and HADOOP_CLASSPATH to distributed-cache files.\n - In Hadoop 2, the situation got better, CLASSPATH is set correctly to have distributed-cache files. But HADOOP_CLASSPATH doesn't. Unfortunately, hadoop scripts don't respect CLASSPATH that is set, so we have to explicitly set HADOOP_CLASSPATH to also point to distributed cache files.\n\nThe solution for this is to have MapReduce set distributed-cache files in HADOOP_CLASSPATH in addition to setting in CLASSPATH.\n\nJunping Du, the patch looks good.\n - We are not setting this for the AM, but that sounds okay.\n - We are making sure that any HADOOP_CLASSPATH already set is inherited instead of replaced - good!\n - We are only put the distributed-cache entries, and skipping MR framework etc - good again!\n\nThe patch looks good to me. Been reviewing this offline. Will check this in if Jenkins says okay.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-08-20T22:02:55.265+0000","updated":"2015-08-20T22:02:55.265+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12856952/comment/14705868","id":"14705868","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"What happens if the user has HADOOP_CLASSPATH set in hadoop-env.sh?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2015-08-20T22:11:46.868+0000","updated":"2015-08-20T22:11:46.868+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12856952/comment/14705894","id":"14705894","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
