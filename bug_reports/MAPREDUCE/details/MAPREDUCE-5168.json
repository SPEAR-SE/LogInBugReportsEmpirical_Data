As the streams are opened in the constructor which the patch isn't changing at all. I am now surprised that this patch helped at all. The MapOutput objects are GC'ed almost always immediately after abort/commit. May be I am missing something.\n\nOTOH, delaying the creation of the output-stream till shuffling to disk is actually going to happen will fix the issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-05-06T23:40:44.260+0000","updated":"2013-05-06T23:40:44.260+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12643497/comment/13650852","id":"13650852","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Thanks for the reviews, Karthik and Vinod.\n\nThis is a case where 0.23 and branch-2/trunk have diverged.  Before MAPREDUCE-4808 the merge threads took a list of MapOutput objects to merge, and these objects could linger around for quite some time waiting to be merged.  Therefore this patch definitely helps on 0.23.  After MAPREDUCE-4808 the MapOutput objects are relatively short-lived, as they only exist for the duration of the file transfer.  I doubt moving the creation of the output-stream from the constructor to the shuffle method will help much, since the Fetcher thread moves straight from the MapOutput constructor to the shuffle phase without delay.\n\nSo this is an important fix for 0.23 and should be harmless for trunk/branch-2.
