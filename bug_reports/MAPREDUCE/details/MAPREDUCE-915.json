It looks mostly good. Also ran the tests, and verified that the debug scrip is indeed run as user by putting in hard-coded sleeps.\n\nSome code-l comments, mostly minor:\n - Rename DebugControllerContext to DebugScriptContext? \n - Rename LAUNCH_DEBUG_SCRIPT to RUN_DEBUG_SCRIPT everywhere?\n\nTaskController.java, DefaultTaskController.java\n - Rename launchDebugScript() to runDebugScript(). We are actually running the script, i.e. waiting for it's finish.\n - Remove the internal-usage javadoc and tag it with @InterfaceAudience.Private?\n\nTaskTracker.java\n - +2372 Code related to adding debug out to diagnostics isn't needed if TaskController.launchDebugScript() fails with an exception.\n - A simple log msg in tasktracker's log when running debug script for a task?\n - Can you also refactor the whole debug-script-business into a single method? It is a good enough amount of isolated code that warrants its own home, me\n thinks.\n\nLinuxTaskController.java\n - I think that we should write the debug command to a new file other than taskjvm.sh? What do others think? This would also mean changes to run_debug_script_as_user() in task-controller.c\n - In any case, I feel we should try to reuse code across run_task_as_user() and run_debug_script_as_user().\n - Much of the code in launchDebugScript() can be replace by a call to LinuxTaskController.runCommand()\n \nTaskLog.java\n - Make readTaskLog() package-private? And mark it as test-only method? Nowhere else is it used now. In fact, why not move it to the test-case that uses it?\n \nTestDebugScript.java\n - Set TTConfig.TT_SLEEP_TIME_BEFORE_SIG_KILL to zero and pass it at MiniMR's cluster-startup? Saves five seconds on the test-time.\n - Typo at +155? \"&&\" instead of \"&\"?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-11-12T11:34:54.357+0000","updated":"2009-11-12T11:34:54.357+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12434070/comment/12777406","id":"12777406","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"body":"Thanks for the review, Vinod!
