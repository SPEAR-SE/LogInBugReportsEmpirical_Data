This heartbeat does catch an UndeclaredThrowableException when the RM is down, caused a ConnectException. The RMCommunicator sends the heartbeat about every second (depending on the config option), and this exception is thrown during each heartbeat as long as the RM is down. When the RM comes back up, however, exceptions stop being thrown altogether.\n \nI'm still investigating to see why no exception is thrown.\n \nIt seems that the \"right\" thing for this communication mechanism between the RM and the AM to recognize that the AM is no longer valid and throw the appropriate exception so that the AM can exit cleanly.\n\nIt looks like when the \"rogue\" MRAM contacts the RM, the RM is telling the AM to reboot, but the RMAM is ignoring it.\n\nI would say that on the MRAM side, RMContainerAllocator.getResource() calls RMContainerRequestor.makeRemoteRequest() to get the response from the RM. At that point, RMContainerAllocator.getResource() should check the reboot flag from the response and throw an exception, which should cause RMCommunicator thread to exit.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-10-21T17:27:33.632+0000","updated":"2011-10-21T17:27:33.632+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12527162/comment/13132871","id":"13132871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

The maxretry can be inited in init() call.\nDone. I initialzed variables in the init.\n\n> Regarding the test, you should be able to mock failure the communicate with the RM and make sure that an internal error is generated. Also, if the MRApp shutsdown on an internal error.\nStill working on the unit tests.\n\n\n\nSid wrote:\n> can the timeout be changed from #failedAttempts to actual time. Currently the MRAM sends a heartbeat at a specific interval (2s default). This may change to ask for containers the moment a task needs to be launched.\nChanged to a timed interval that will keep trying to contact the RM and error out only if a certain amount of time has expired.\n\n> The LocalContainerAllocator (used by uberized jobs) would need to be changed as well.\nI have changed the LocalContainerAllocator code as well.
