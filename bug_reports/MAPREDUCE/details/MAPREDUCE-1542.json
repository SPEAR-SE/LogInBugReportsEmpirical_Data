The configuration of the common components like Http servers, RPC servers/clients will not have mapred/hdfs specific naming conventions. For e.g., I don't see {{ipc.server.listen.queue.size}} or {{ipc.client.connect.max.retries}} being split into mapred and hdfs specific configuration items despite the fact that JT and NN need different values.

Maybe 'User who started the cluster' while more verbose conveys the meaning better.\n- JobTracker: JobConf.MR_SUPERGROUP reads mapred.permissions.supergroup. Error message here says mapreduce.cluster.permissions.supergroup.\n- JobTracker.checkAccess is saying that mrOwner and admins can do any operation on the job; however the code is checking queue ACLs first. Hence if the UGI does not have access to do the appropriate operation for the queue, this documentation will be incorrect.\n- JobACLsManager.checkAccess has a typo in javadoc: \"The mrOwner and admins always\" -> 'are' is missing.\n- One reference to mapred.permissions.supergroup in description of mapreduce.job.acl-modify-job in mapred-default.xml\n- isMROwnerOrAdmin seems out of place in JobTracker. Note that it takes the owner and adminsACL as parameters, and hence can live in any class. Had this not been the case, then the API is fine. I see JobACLsManager as the class responsible for all ACLs checks. So, why can't the mrowner and acls be created inside this class when it is instantiated ? Then, isMROwnerOrAdmin can be implemented directly in JobACLsManager itself. This will also avoid the static call dependencies between TaskTracker classes and JobTracker which also seem a little odd.\n- I think it makes sense to add checks for queue ACLs refresh, service refresh and user-to-group mapping refresh also similar to node refresh.

Exhaustive tests need not be end-to-end I think - i.e. they need not run real jobs.

'admin' user is part of the adminGroup (as defined in the custom user to group mapping). Then we drive all operations setting 'admin' as the user. All of these will cover the code path of checking the adminUser because these will be mapped to the adminGroup which is in the administrators ACL.

I propose the following change in the configuration for fixing administrator access:\n1. Remove hadoop.cluster.administrators\n2. Replace mapred.permissions.supergroup with an acl: mapreduce.cluster.administrators\n3. The change in HDFS can be decided later, in a different HDFS issue. Will leave dfs.persmissions.supergrop as is, for now. \nSo, when individual daemons create HTTPServer they will set appropriate administrator acl for the HTTPServer. Here, mapred daemons will set the value of mapreduce.cluster.administrators and HDFS daemons will set ' '(space) followed by hdfs.persmissions.supergrop.\n\nThoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-04-30T07:55:10.498+0000","updated":"2010-04-30T07:55:10.498+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457693/comment/12862698","id":"12862698","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"You clearly don't want to know my thoughts, given the conversation that happened in this very jira months ago.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-04-30T14:51:30.805+0000","updated":"2010-04-30T14:51:30.805+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457693/comment/12863240","id":"12863240","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Allen, you could say we didn't understand your intent.
