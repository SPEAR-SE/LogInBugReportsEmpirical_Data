Running a quick test program, the interfaces appear to be loaded from rt.jar, but the implementations still come from tools.jar on Linux. So we shouldn't need tools.jar on the classpath for building Sqoop itself. Then tools.jar should be implicitly loaded by the JVM to satisfy {{ToolProvider.getJavaCompiler()}} if necessary. A quick test on OS X shows that it loads the same JavacTool class from classes.jar there, so we don't need to special-case anything with our classpath.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-16T19:34:18.262+0000","updated":"2009-12-16T19:34:18.262+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438945/comment/12791676","id":"12791676","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"New patch that rewrites CompilationManager to use {{javax.tools.JavaCompiler}} and friends.
