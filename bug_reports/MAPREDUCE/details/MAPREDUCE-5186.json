I wasn't sure whether the concern that led to the max split locations is no longer valid (at least in hadoop 2).\n\nAFAIK the limit was primarily intended to protect the JobTracker from being excessively bogged down by jobs with huge numbers of split locations.  In Hadoop 2 the concern is lessened somewhat since part of the JT responsibilities are in the job-specific AM.  However the RM could still be impacted since it will see a large request from the AM as it tries to obtain locality for the split.\n\nbq. I'm not 100% familiar with this part of the code, but by truncating aren't we dropping some of these locations on the floor? \n\nNo, I don't believe so.  If you look at JobSplitWriter it is writing out the split details separately from the locations.  The locations are used solely for determining locality for map tasks.  From a map task perspective, the locations aren't very interesting since it just needs to be able to open the file(s).  It doesn't need the locations to do that, and if some split did need location details they'd be written out as part of serializing the split itself.  So bottom line for truncating the locations is that data locality might not be as ideal as it could be for the task processing the split, but the split will still be processed properly regardless.\n\nGiven that a user/admin can disable the location truncation off by setting the config to a very large value if desired, I think we should preserve the MR1 behavior to lighten the load on the AM/RM for jobs with lots of split locations.  I think the first patch is very close, although the unit test change in that patch isn't appropriate.  It should really be more of a unit test (i.e.: no minicluster) that invokes the JobSplitWriter to write out splits with more locations than the configured maximum and verify that the locations were truncated in the job split file written.  There should be unit tests for both old-style splits and new-style splits to verify the truncation is occurring in both places.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-10-25T16:52:57.223+0000","updated":"2013-10-25T16:52:57.223+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12644974/comment/13805652","id":"13805652","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the clarification.
