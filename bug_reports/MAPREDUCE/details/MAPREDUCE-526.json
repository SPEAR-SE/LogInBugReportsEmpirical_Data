These Job statuses are used in JobQueuesManager to categorize jobs based on the state they are in. The data structure in JobQueuesManager(waitingJobs) uses startTime as the comparator.As waitingJobs has old startTime value , it has the old entry.\nWhenever we try to do \"hadoop job -list\" JobTracker's getJobStatus method is called , this sets the JobStatus startTime value with JobInProgress startTime value , now at this point , startTime values in JIP and JobStatus are consistent, but the startTime value in waitingJobs in JobQueueManager is stale . Hence when we try to remove the jobs which are completed(Completed/killed/failed , for example issueing \"hadoop job -kill <>\" command ) from waitingJobs() nothing is removed as comparator startTime is changed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-05-22T10:15:06.777+0000","updated":"2009-05-22T10:15:06.777+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12424929/comment/12712051","id":"12712051","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Beautiful!
