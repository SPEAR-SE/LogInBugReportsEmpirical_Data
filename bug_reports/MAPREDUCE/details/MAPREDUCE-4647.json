Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I think that it is a regression.  It looks like Yarn/MRV2 changed the handling of job.jar to be through the distributed cache.  Originally we only added the jar to the classpath as a cache file.  MAPREDUCE-4068 then changed it to be a cache archive so that the classes and lib directories could be added to the classpath.  So both of those together effectively undid MAPREDUCE-967.  I am not sure how simple it will be to try and fully implement MAPREUDCE-967 again, because the job.jar is going through the distributed cache and this really is behavior that seems to be MAPREDUCE specific, unless we want to some how try and make it generic for everyone on YARN.\n\nThat is why I wanted to have the client look at the jar and decided if it should be a cache file, or a cache archive.  From what I have seen very few jars actually rely on this behavior.  If you would prefer to make it generic for YARN I can look into that instead.  It should not be too hard, but it might require a small change to the container launch context.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-09-10T16:04:10.669+0000","updated":"2012-09-10T16:04:10.669+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12606875/comment/13452111","id":"13452111","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Actually I do think I will do it in a generic way through YARN.
