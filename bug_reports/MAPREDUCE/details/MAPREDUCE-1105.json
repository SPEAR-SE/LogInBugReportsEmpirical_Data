\"mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.<queue-name>.max.map.slots\" and \"mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.<queue-name>.max.reduce.slots\" variables , these where used to throttle the queue, i.e, these were the hard limit and not allowing \nqueue to grow further.\n-Added the new parameter \"mapred.capacity-scheduler.queue.<queue-name>.maximum-capacity\" \nmaximum-capacity defines a limit beyond which a queue cannot use the capacity of the cluster. This provides a means to limit how much excess capacity a queue can use. By default, there is no limit.The maximum-capacity of a queue can only be greater than or equal to its minimum capacity. Default value of -1 implies a queue can use complete capacity of the cluster.\n\n This property could be to curtail certain jobs which are long running in nature from occupying more than a  certain percentage of the cluster, which in the absence of pre-emption, could lead to capacity guarantees of  other queues being affected. One important thing to note is that maximum-capacity is a percentage , so based on the cluster's capacity the max capacity would change.

This happens before spare capacity is distributed for queues whose capacity is undefined. If the capacity of a queue is undefined, but it's maxCapacity is defined, this leads to a case where the validation will pass, but after the spare capacity is distributed, this may no longer be valid.\n- It doesn't seem like TaskSchedulingContext.LIMIT_NORMALIZED_CAPACITY_STRING is required at all. The only purpose it was there was to tell administrators that they are getting less than their capacities because of limits. Since this should never happen now, we should remove this. Likewise, the TaskSchedulingContext.toString() method will need modification to not have any checks for maxCapacity limits.\n- Javadoc of TaskSchedulingContext.getCapacity needs update.\n- TaskSchedulingContext.toString is not showing maxCapacity value for the queue. This seems an existing bug - not introduced in this patch.\n- CapacityTaskScheduler.areTasksInQueueOverLimit is still referring to maxTaskLimit in a comment.\n- In TestCapacityScheduler, rather than removing the test cases related to limits, I would think it is better to convert them into test cases for maxCapacities. There will be some change required, because in these tests we were setting the maxLimit to be less than the capacity. But, in general, these tests will ensure that features like handling high RAM jobs and user limits is working with maxCapacities.\n- The current implementation of implementing limits on capacity may have a bug. Consider if a queue is one slot below it's maxCapacity. CapacityTaskScheduler.areTasksInQueueOverLimit will return false. Now suppose the job being scheduled is a high RAM job, then it could actually go beyond its capacity. Maybe when we are assigning a task from a job in a queue, before the assignment we should again check if the currently used slots + number of slots required for this job will cause the limit to exceed.\n- TestCapacityScheduler.checkOccupiedSlots is adding zeros to some indices. This should be removed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-10-19T07:52:44.473+0000","updated":"2009-10-19T07:52:44.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438026/comment/12767352","id":"12767352","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Comments on the 20 patch:\n\n- Some of the comments in trunk apply for the 20 patch as well, please check them once to ensure they are covered too.\n- Updates to forrest documentation needs to be done.\n- Javadoc for the API CapacitySchedulerConf.getMaxCapacity can be improved. Something like: Return the maximum percentage of the cluster capacity that can be used by the given queue. Also, @param and @return values can be filled up.\n- The call to getRaw seems redundant, as we can query with default value -1 right from the beginning.\n- Since maxCapacity can be equal to capacity, in the IllegalArgumentException in getMaxCapacity, we can say maxCapacity should be greater than or equal to capacity.\n- Comments in testHighMemoryBlockingWithMaxCapacity are broken. For instance, we have 4 maps and 4 reduces but are saying 2 reduces. Can we please not comment on or log things that are obvious ? Then we wouldn't have the pain of having to keep them in sync with code.\n- Also, testHighMemoryBlockingWithMaxCapacity may need change after fixing the bug about adhering to limits while scheduling high RAM tasks, since we won't be able to assign tasks from the high RAM reduces without crossing limits.\n- For testUserLimitsWithMaxCapacities, the last call should be null. As discussed offline, I think there's a bug with checkMultipleAssignment which is throwing a false positive.\n- checkMultipleAssignment is being called only when multiple assignment is set to true.

The problem is if noOfSlotsPerTask is 0, then this means the number of occupied slots is already at maxCapacity and we will end up scheduling more. This seems a bug. One approach that seems to work is the call from assignTasks can pass in noOfSlotsPerTask as 1 instead of 0. This way, the API is interpreted as saying if we add 1 more slot to the current number of slots, will we be over limit.\n- In testHighMemoryBlockingWithMaxCapacity, memory for reduce tasks for job1 should be 1024 instead of 1.\n- In the test cases related to max capacities, expectedStrings map is not being cleared.
