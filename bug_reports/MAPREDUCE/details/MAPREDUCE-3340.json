It was originally added for performance reasons to avoid launching new JVMs altogether for job-setup and job-cleanup. With Yarn and MRAppMaster, setup and cleanup are run inside the AM itself and so nothing much can be gained by making them optional.\n\nBefore 0.23, we could disable set up and cleanup, yet obtain the output when using FileOutputCommitter in the job-output directory. But post 0.23.0, that won't be the case because of the nested temporary directories to support AM recoverability.
