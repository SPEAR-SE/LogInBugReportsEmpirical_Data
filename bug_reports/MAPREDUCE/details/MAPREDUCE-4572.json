I thought about that too. I think it is useful to have the option to disable it in case - for security reasons - the user wants to disable serving aliases. Especially, when it is disabled, although the the task logs are no longer available via logs/userlogs, but they can be available from the job history server. After all, the ability to configure and disable this property is not harmful, but adds more flexibility.
