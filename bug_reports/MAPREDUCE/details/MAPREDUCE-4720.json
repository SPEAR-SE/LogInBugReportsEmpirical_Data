I *had* updated it in a separate branch and forgot to include it in the patch. Here's the whole branch. I generated this patch using git diff --binary --no-prefix --full-index . I have yet to figure out how to apply this using patch.\n\nNathan had suggested me to use YSlow and fix the bad grade it gave. I put in a few improvements:\n1. Combined multiple Javascript files so that fewer HTTP connections are opened.\n2. Static content is being sent with the \"Expires\" header set to an year from when the request is made.\n3. Datatables upgraded and deferred rendering.\n\nIts taking about 8 seconds to render the 20000 fake jobs. An improvement from 11 seconds but still leaves something to be desired.\n\nQuestions:\n1. Should I combine all the JS files? Or only the well known jquery, jquery-ui and jquery-datatables libraries?\n2. Should I version the static directory? I didn't feel the need because a refresh on the client browser can be made to refetch the un-expired content anyway.\n3.
