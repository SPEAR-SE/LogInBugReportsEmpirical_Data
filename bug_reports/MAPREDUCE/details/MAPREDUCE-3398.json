Change the NM and RM interaction - to have the RM wait for all NMs to notify the RM about contianer / app completion (or timeout). This would pretty much be a reversal of the current mechanism where the RM is responsible for app completion. Would be risky - the RM should not have to wait for NMs.\n2. Have the NMs run as a proxy user - has a lot of operational issues, and possibly security concerns.\n3. Aggregate logs as the NM user - this breaks the CLI.\n4. The NMs asks for application token renewal while log aggregation is still to complete. This seems like the best option.
