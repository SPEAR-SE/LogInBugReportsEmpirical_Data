A few notes after a first pass (I have not examined the statistics code, yet):\n* {{TestGridmixSubmission}} is an expensive test to run; the cluster startup/shutdown can be amortized across runs (as can the data generation). If this needs to clean up between jobs, consider using {{@Before}} and {{@After}} instead of making separate tests (i.e., no subclassing the unit test). The current patch also makes many fields protected without referencing them in subclasses and also makes static, inner classes into member classes for reasons that aren't obvious (e.g. {{FilterJobStory}})\n* Very minor nits: the coding standards recommend whitespace after commas and before and after braces. Control statements also must enclose their blocks in braces e.g. \"{{if (expr) { stmt }}}\", never \"{{if (expr) stmt}}\", \"{{foo(a, b, c) {}}\" never \"{{foo(a, b,c){}}\". Some lines in the patch exceed 80 characters\n* {{DebugGridmix::createJobMonitor}} should allow IOExceptions to escape and fail instead of logging the exception\n* {{statistics}} is a more descriptive name than {{collector}} for the {{StatsCollector}} references\n* It would probably be cleaner to pull the {{REPLAY}} mode into a separate class, allowing {{JobFactory}} to be an abstract base.\n* The {{JobMonitor::process}} method can probably be removed, since it doesn't do any meaningful work (the instance is instead passed to the downstream {{StatsCollector}}, which does). The monitor is then only responsible for determining when the job is done, not its outcome The unit test can subclass the downstream component instead of subclassing {{JobMonitor}}\n* Instead of making {{JobFactory::rThread}} protected, adding an abstract {{createReaderThead}} would also allow it to remain final\n* The {{SerialJobFactory}} includes logic that preserves submission times, but it should be submitting the job so that it executes immediately. Since the queue between the {{JobFactory}} and {{JobSubmitter}} will never have more than 1 element in it, it should be sufficient to submit new jobs at the system time.\n* The {{SerialJobFactory}} should either be waiting on a condition or add new jobs to the submitter while holding the lock. Otherwise it's possible (though extremely unlikely) for signals to be missed.\n* If a job fails submission in serial mode, wil the {{JobFactory}} be woken up?\n* Instead of adding {{GridmixJobSubmissionPolicy::getPolicy}}, callers can use {{Configuration::getEnum}} (so callers may specify the default)\n* The poll interval in the submission policy enum should be specified as a final param on the instance (as the name is), not by an abstract method. The {{getName}} method is the same as its {{toString}}, isn't it?

For the current purpose, it is sufficient to keep only a counter\n* Instead of fixing {{MAX_JOBS_COMPLETED_IN_POLL_INTERVAL}} to 1, it would make sense to let this parameter be configurable. {{SERIAL}} submission should set it to 1 but {{STRESS}} can be less aggressive by default. It would make sense to let this be defined by the enum, as the polling interval is in the current patch\n* Excluding {{SERIAL}} where the max jobs per interval is implicit, letting the {{STRESS}} and {{REPLAY}} define defaults for configurable parameters rather than fixed values may make sense (for both max jobs/interval and the interval period)\n* The default of 1000ms for {{STRESS}} is too low\n* Setting the interrupt flag is unnecessary if that is the condition for shutting down the thread- as in {{StatsCollector.Collector::run}} and {{JobFactory::run}}. The only reason to reset the flag is if the current context does not know how to handle the interrupt, but its caller might and it cannot throw {{InterruptedException}}. Returning from {{run}} is correct in this case.\n* The {{StatListener}} interface, the new {{JobFactory}} subclasses, and {{StatsCollector}} should be package-private. If {{JobFactory}} is made an abstract base, it may make sense to make it public\n* {{StatsCollector::join}} should respect the timeout provided, not wait forever\n* This block in {{StressReaderThread::run}}:\n{noformat}\n+          synchronized (lock) {\n+            while (loadStatus.isOverloaded) {\n+              //Wait while JT is overloaded.\n+              try {\n+                lock.wait();\n+              } catch (InterruptedException ie) {\n+                Thread.currentThread().interrupt();\n+              }\n+            }\n+          }\n{noformat}\nDoes not seem correct. If interrupted while waiting, {{InterruptedException}} will be thrown, caught, the flag reset, causing another exception to be thrown. If interrupted, the thread should exit. A similar pattern is in {{StatsCollector.Collector::run}}\n* As with {{SerialJobFactory}}, {{StressJobFactory}} should be submitting jobs to be run immediately, not at the interval recorded in the trace. The submission time in the trace can be disregarded entirely.\n* {{StatsCollector::addClusterStatsObservers}} has no callers; how does one subscribe to the statistics updates from the JT?\n* {{LoadCalculator::checkLoadAndGetSlotsAvailable}} should use commons logging at debug level, rather than {{System.out}}. Similarly, many of these statements are non-trivial to construct and should be guarded by {{LOG.isDebugEnabled()}}\n* Log message such as: {{LOG.error(ie.getCause(), ie)}} Should instead include a message and the exception (which will also include its cause)\n* The {{LoadCalculator}} methods can probably be part of {{StressJobFactory}} rather than static methods in a separate class","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-02-13T09:59:36.927+0000","updated":"2010-02-13T09:59:36.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12446505/comment/12834089","id":"12834089","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Implemented all the points mentioned above except:\nThe JobMonitor::process method can probably be removed, since it doesn't do any meaningful work (the instance is instead passed to the downstream StatsCollector, which does).
