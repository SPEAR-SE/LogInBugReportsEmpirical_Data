Right now there is only one setting so if you have queues that are running very different jobs, its not very efficient.   For instance, what if one queue is running all uberAM's, You want that queue to have maximum-am-resource-percent close to 100%, but if another queue on the same cluster is running jobs with lots of maps/reduces per job you may only want it at 10% because starting other AM's will just waste memory as they will have to wait for the first job anyway. So lets say you set it at 50% to get somewhere in the middle. That means you are wasting half of the queue that wants to run all uberAM's. That 50% may also be to high if you have yet another queue that is set to use 1% of the cluster capacity.  Note that the calculation for maxActiveApps is using the minimumAllocation setting, so if a user sets its AM memory to be much more then that and the queue is small, you could deadlock again. \n\nNote that I'm mostly interested in maximum-am-resource-percent. The maximum-applications we can leave alone.\n\nI believe the way Eric has it only makes it more complicated if you want to configure it per queue. The global is still there but if you want to override then you can set it per queue.  Obviously more settings does introduce the chance for more mis-config but I don't see it anymore complicated then what is already there per queue.  I'm worried without this we won't be using the cluster very efficiently or we will run into deadlocks because we set it high but the smaller capacity queues won't be able to handle that.\n\nIf you have other ideas or thoughts please let us know.
