This is done, because getLocalCache increments referenceCount first and then localizes. Reference count should be decremented for the one just failed also. So, it should be added to the list before the getLocalCache call.\n\nUmm. But (atleast theoretically), it is still possible that a call to getLocalCache fails before referenceCount is incremented. For e.g. makeRelative throws IOException; so does getLocalCacheForWrite. Hence, we still have a situation where we record a file as being localized (by storing it in localizedCacheFiles), but the reference count is not actually incremented. And releaseCache would have the bug this JIRA is talking about still.\n\nOne more point I am slightly uncomfortable about is the duplication of state because of the new list localizedCacheFiles. \n\nHere's an alternate proposal:\n\n- Modify CacheFile to have a boolean saying isLocalized. By default, this is false. This will be set to true if distributedCacheManager.getLocalCache returns successfully.\n- To handle the case you have mentioned above, where a failure can happen after referenceCount is incremented in getLocalCache, I would suggest we catch exceptions inside getLocalCache, and on an exception, decrement the referenceCount and re-throw the exception.

The path to verify successful localization is already covered.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-11-27T10:30:34.210+0000","updated":"2009-11-27T10:30:34.210+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438900/comment/12783527","id":"12783527","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"re-submitting for hudson","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-11-30T03:39:34.266+0000","updated":"2009-11-30T03:39:34.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438900/comment/12783533","id":"12783533","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I looked at the Yahoo! hadoop 0.20 patch, and have the same comment with respect to throwing the exception in DistributedCache.getLocalCache.

It was not very clear why file1 was being added twice. Some more details on configuration - that it was run on a single node, max failures was set to 1 should be documented for better understanding.\n\n- Configuration :\nThe tests run on a single node running JT/NN and another node running TT/DN.\nmap.max.attempts is set to 1 and reduce.max.attempts is also set to 1 and local.cache.size is set to 4 GB and mapred.local.dir is set to only 1 spindle and not all the spindles.\nThis is done to force the TT to localize in the same path and try deleting the localcaheFiles when the size exceeds 4 GB.\n\nThe idea of the above testcase is :\nRan Job1 with cache files file1 and file2 - Job succeeded.\nRan Job2 with cache files file3 and file1. When file3 is getting localized, removed file3 from dfs - Job2 failed.\n   - Here since file3 is deleted, the reference count of file1 should not be decremented twice(once during setup and once during cleanup).Thats the objective of this scenario.\n\nRan Job3 with cache files file1, file1(again) and file4. file4 is huge (say 5GB), larger than local.cache.size.\n - To make sure that the decrement happened properly, file1 is added twice. When file4 is added, which \nis more than local cache size, other files like file2 and file3 ( which were used in the previous jobs) gets deleted\nbut not file1 (because it had reference count proper ).\n\n| In order to match the regressions tests in trunk, I would suggest we also have in Job 2 a file, say file5, which we should verify is not even localized (because file3 fails localization). Then we can include file 5 in Job 3 and make sure localization happens successfully.\n\nThis scenario is  tested and the localization happens successfully.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=iyappans","name":"iyappans","key":"iyappans","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Iyappan Srinivasan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-30T13:08:09.893+0000","updated":"2009-11-30T13:08:09.893+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438900/comment/12783801","id":"12783801","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #138 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/138/])\n    ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-30T19:10:26.504+0000","updated":"2009-11-30T19:10:26.504+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438900/comment/12784922","id":"12784922","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #162 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/162/])\n    ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-12-02T17:32:54.925+0000","updated":"2009-12-02T17:32:54.925+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12438900/comment/12804088","id":"12804088","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"More recent patch for earlier version of Hadoop.
