However, in the case of a regular AM getting killed we should have some code in the shut-down hook to update the URL.\n\nSounds like a reasonable approach, but in practice it's tricky.  The AM attempt would need to determine know how to behave when a SIGTERM arrives.  A SIGTERM does not necessarily mean the application as a whole is being killed.  For example, an AM attempt can be killed for exceeding its container resource limits or via explicit request (see YARN-261), but the app itself is not being killed in those cases and a new app attempt should be subsequently launched.  If the AM attempt being killed unregisters then that would prevent subsequent AM attempts from being launched.  However if the app is being killed then it should unregister.  The app attempt would need some way to know the difference.  It may have to connect to the RM as a client to query its own app id to see if the RM thinks the app is killed.\n\nAssuming the MR AM can figure out what to do when the SIGTERM arrives, it has more to do than just update the tracking URL.  A tracking URL pointing to the history server doesn't help if the history server doesn't know about the job.  So it must flush the history events to the jhist file and copy the file to the done_intermediate directory before updating the tracking URL.\n\nCurrently a YARN kill is very similar to a kill -9.  The NM sends a SIGTERM followed by a SIGKILL 250 milliseconds later.  If the cluster is loaded or the node the attempt is running on is overloaded, the AM attempt may not finish these tasks in time.  YARN-337 helps the YARN-killed scenario a bit by at least pointing the user to the RM app page rather than just leaving the tracking URL a broken link as it did before.\n\nIt would be nice if the AM did a best-effort attempt to provide history in this scenario, but I wonder how often this scenario is actually occurring in practice.  Does anyone have metrics on how often this occurs and how often the AM attempt is running when it does?  I suspect the most common case by far is the AM isn't running when the job is killed.  If that's the case then this change won't really impact users.  If that's not the case then we should focus efforts on why the client isn't able to communicate with the AM to kill the job via MapReduce, as that will more consistently produce history than a YARN-kill.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-09-18T14:07:49.510+0000","updated":"2013-09-18T14:07:49.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667936/comment/13770900","id":"13770900","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jrottinghuis","name":"jrottinghuis","key":"jrottinghuis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joep Rottinghuis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks Jason, those are some excellent points to consider.\n\nJoep\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jrottinghuis","name":"jrottinghuis","key":"jrottinghuis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joep Rottinghuis","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-09-18T15:47:55.508+0000","updated":"2013-09-18T15:47:55.508+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667936/comment/13770959","id":"13770959","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I believe part of the reason it may happen more is if users are using \"yarn application -kill appid\" for killing MR jobs.

From our investigation, it appears that the client's kill sends a KILL to the App Master as well as to the RM for this App.\n\nWere you actually seeing the AM shutdown due to the SIGTERM it would receive as part of the YARN kill, or did you see \"Kill job received from client ....\" in the AM logs as well?  I see in YARNRunner.killJob that it can send a kill to the AM and later to the RM if for 10 seconds the AM doesn't end up in the KILLED state.  That, too, seems to be a bug, since it really should be checking not for state != KILLED but rather for state not in a terminal state, i.e.: FAILED, KILLED, SUCCEEDED.

Sleeps also slow down the process in general, and it would be better to solve it without them if possible.  Also MAPREDUCE-5497 didn't add a sleep, rather it moved an existing sleep to later in the AM shutdown process.  That sleep is simply there for the AM to linger around for clients to fetch the final job status rather than redirect to the history server.

So the fix seems to be in two places in YARNRunner. \n\nI think that the first call to resMgrDelegate.killApplication should occur when the job is in PREP state, (as opposed to !RUNNING in the current code). At this time, there is no RUNNING/FAILED/SUCCEEDED/KILLED status since it probably has not even started running. Hence the kill to RM and return would make sense. In this case, the application ends up in KILLED/KILLED which is correct according to me. The \"Tracking URL: History\" on the cluster/app/application_number page points to itself, which is also correct in this case I think.\n\nThe second call to resMgrDelegate.killApplication should occur when the JobStatus is in any of the terminal states - KILLED/SUCCEEDED/FAILED. In this case, the application ends up in FINISHED/KILLED , FINISHED/SUCCEEDED (I haven't yet experimented with FAILED).

Or even better, attach a patch to the JIRA and move it to Patch Available so the Jenkins bot can comment.\n\nAs for the patch itself, it's a bit odd to be checking the JobStatus.State for PREP if we're already talking to the AM in the first place.  If we got a successful connection to the AM in order to ask its current state, why not just send it the kill?  All of this is trying to determine whether we can connect to the AM.  If we can connect to it, we should send it a kill.  Seems better to just do the bottom portion of the loop where we try repeatedly to send it a kill as long as it's not in a terminal state and fallback to the RM if after repeated attempts it is not in a terminal state.\n\nAlso the patch misses one extra status.getState() != JobStatus.State.KILLED check, and that's within the loop condition.  There's no point in looping for 10 seconds trying to kill an application that is in the FAILED or SUCCEEDED state.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-09-20T15:51:35.167+0000","updated":"2013-09-20T15:51:35.167+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12667936/comment/13773357","id":"13773357","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vrushalic","name":"vrushalic","key":"vrushalic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10433","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10433","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10433","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10433"},"displayName":"Vrushali C","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Sounds good, thanks!

From our investigation, it appears that the client's kill sends a KILL to the App Master as well as to the RM for this App.\n\nIf this is the case, obviously the first killApplication is not executed but the second. This means killJob has been executed, but after 10s we find the job is still not killed. It is possible that the code path doesn't check the other two final states, SUCCEEDED and FAILED, therefore, kill is invoked on RM. However, it should no longer be problem after MAPREDUCE-5505, because when the job returns SUCCEEDED/FAILED, it has already unregistered with RM, and updated the tracking URL.\n\nIt is also possible that process kill is delayed on AM due to some random issue, and the job is still in RUNNING after 10s. On the other side while RM moves so fast to complete the kill. Then, the tracking URL will not be updated. I'm afraid the patch is not going to take care of this possibility.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=zjshen","name":"zjshen","key":"zjshen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Zhijie Shen","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-11-15T08:17:26.419+0000","updated":"2013-11-15T08:17:26.419+0000"}],"maxResults":25,"total":25,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-5502/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1nzgv:"}}
