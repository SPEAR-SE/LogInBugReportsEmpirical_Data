So here is how the mapping from hdfs audit-log-format to mapreduce audit-log-format might look like\n||hdfs||mapreduce||\n|ugi|agent|\n|remote-ip|-|\n|command|operation|\n|src-path|target|\n|dst path|-|\n|permissions|-|\n|-|result|\n|-|reason|\n\nSo here is a straight forward merge :\n{noformat}\n<agent> <remote-ip> <operation> <target> <permissions*> <result*> <reason*>\n* means optional\n{noformat}\n\nSo for hdfs, target will be src-path:dest-path. And for mapreduce, we could skip permissions or print acls. But the only point that doesnt fit this model for mapreduce is the job-initialization event. For job-initialization, what should be the value of remote-ip?\n\nNot sure if we are doing an overfit. So for now I think we can keep it simple and have different models for hdfs and mapreduce. \n\nbq. Do we need to include host IP of the requestor ? I don't even know if it is possible to get this information though.\nI am not sure how that will help. I think username should suffice. It is possible to get the IP of the caller using _o.a.h.ipc.Server.getRemoteIp()_.\n\nbq. One concern with implementation is - if some of this logging is happening under the jobtracker lock, it might impact performance adversely. Can we plan to handle this ?\nThe idea here is to replace  LOG.* statements with AUDIT_LOG.*. So in terms of logging overhead, it should be same. In my initial implementation exercise, I have not seen a case where I had to add extra log lines. Let me check if this needs to be addressed. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-03-11T10:07:49.832+0000","updated":"2010-03-11T10:07:49.832+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457695/comment/12844029","id":"12844029","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Amar,\n\nPrimarily I am thinking that having a format close to HDFS is good, because the HDFS audit log has been around for a while now and is probably something users are used to. That said, I think we may also want to keep in mind the cost of getting all the information to keep the two logs similar.\n\nI had a discussion with Vinod and Ravi also about this. To me, printing UGI (in place of agent, which is just user name) and remote-ip would be good. However, opinion is not fully converging on this. Ravi and Vinod feel UGI might be too verbose and also getting the groups for a user could impact performance if the groups are not cached.\n\nRemote IP is very useful, IMO. If something failed, having the remote IP will help identify the source of trouble. I am even thinking there might be cases where valid users due to misconfigured nodes could face failures. And logging the remote IP will help weed out these misconfigurations.\n\nGiven the above, one thought is to have groups and remote-ip optional, and log them only for failures.\n\nPermissions equals ACLs for us. ACLs can be verbose too. Hence, it falls in the same category as the above two fields.\n\nI would also suggest a key=value kind of format for this. If HDFS is also using the same, I think this is definitely the way to go.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-03-11T11:26:53.183+0000","updated":"2010-03-11T11:26:53.183+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457695/comment/12845755","id":"12845755","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Attaching a patch for earlier version of Hadoop, on behalf of Amar.

Overall the approach in the patch seems clean to me.\n\n- I think AuditLogManager can be pulled into a separate class file.\n- Keeping the list of keys as javadoc comments seems like a maintenance overhead. I would instead suggest that the Keys be defined as an Enum. Then it will be easy to query the Enum names as an API. Doing this will also prevent the duplication of the key names in the logSuccess and logFailure APIs.\n- I am not sure 'agent' is conveying the right meaning. Seems like 'user' or 'userid' will be more clear. What is the equivalent in DFS ? Also, ip should be 'remote-ip'.\n- Reason seems confusing. Can we keep it generic - maybe as a string ? For e.g. in JobInProgress, where we check the conf user is the same as the submitting user, and fails, 'permission denied' is not giving a proper meaning. We can expand and say what exactly failed. In fact, maybe we can change the name of the tag 'Reason' to 'AdditionalInfo' or something like that so it is more general. Then, in QueueManager, I think it makes sense to log the jobid, when it is available (note there are cases when it is not available), maybe as additional Info. This way we can do things like grep by job-id and get a full trail.\n- Don't tabs make the lines appear too long, Blanks would suffice, no ?\n- Some values like 'permissions' and 'reason' (if this is a free format string) can have whitespaces. Would it be good to surround these with quotes for easy parsing ?\n- Suggest the parameter 'operation' could be of type String as well - if we are going to do a toString anyway.\n- If there's no cost to logging remote-ip, I'd recommend adding it everywhere as a mandatory parameter.\n- The comment '//for testcases' is misleading. I think what you mean is that the check for IP being null is required as test cases may not have this defined. I'd suggest it be documented as such.\n- Why are we logging success again in JobTracker.addJob, wouldn't the same line come up in QueueManager.checkAccess ?\n- Seems like Operations \"REFRESH_NODES\", \"QUEUE_REFRESH\" and target \"Jobtracker\" can be static final variables. Should we pull all such AuditLogManager related constants into some constants file ? Like AuditLogConstants or something ?\n- \"REFRESH_NODES\" and \"QUEUE_REFRESH\" seem similar operations, but they have different names, it should be \"REFRESH_NODES\" and \"REFRESH_QUEUES\"\n- JobACLsManager.checkAccess has some lines incorrectly indented.\n- I don't think we need to give 'Queue:' prefix, it is understood that if it is a queue operation, then the target will be a queue.\n- Failure logging should be at WARN level - as done in the other audit log.\n- Can we move the refreshAcls logging into QueueManager.refreshQueueAcls - so that failures can be logged too.\n- Can we add a few simple unit tests that test the formatting of the log message alone. i.e. we can define a package private API in AuditLogManager - something like String getLogLine(...). We can call these in the log*** APIs in AuditLogManager. We can also call it with various arguments in tests and verify that the return string is proper. We can test null values, values with whitespace etc.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-03-16T07:43:41.701+0000","updated":"2010-03-16T07:43:41.701+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12457695/comment/12845766","id":"12845766","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"bq.
