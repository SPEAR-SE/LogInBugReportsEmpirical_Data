With a '+' or other non-encoded URL character in the real system path containing Hadoop, go to http://jt:50030/jobhistory.jsp.\n2. Click on one of the job ids to view job history details.\n3.a. Get a 500 response due to a FileNotFound exception ex. java.io.FileNotFoundException: File file:/Users/esammer/Applications/hadoop-0.20.1 152/logs/history/done/ (note the '+' in the Hadoop dir is a space).\n\nAfter the patch:\n\n1.5. Observe the '+' is encoded as %2B in the job id link.\n3.b. Instead of 3.a., observe that the page loads successfully.\n\nThis is the test case I followed. This patch is very specific in that it deals with this singular link. The motivation behind doing a deep dive into the web app architecture is to address other places where user input or OS file system paths are used to build links for similar reasons.
