I suppose an assumption was that the directories and files created during this localization process had read permissions automatically for the owner of the files. And since the owner of the files, basically the user tasktracker is running as, was also the owner of the task process, this was sufficient to access the cache files.\n\nIn HADOOP-4490, we had a situation where the tasktracker and the task could run as different users. The tracker localizes the files and the task needs to access the files. So at a minimum, read and execute permissions on directories and files to others needed to be granted. As mentioned in the comment linked above, a choice was made to recursively set these permissions on all files starting from the base directory - a performance problem as observed on clusters with a very, very large number of localized cache files.\n\nIn MAPREDUCE-856, to solve the requirement of securing access to the distributed cache files, the local directory structure was changed to be per user. Further, in the LinuxTaskController, ownership and permissions were set for all files under a user's archive folder to the user and providing access only to that user. For the DefaultTaskController, the same changes as made in HADOOP-4490 were retained, though it was possibly unnecessary.\n\nFirst, to revisit if we need any permission setting for distributed cache files:\n\nI think this is still required. For the DefaultTaskController, executable permissions need to be set on the localized files as in the pre-HADOOP-4490 days. For the LinuxTaskController, we need to change ownership and set permissions in the task controller for that user.\n\nHowever, in both cases, I suppose we only need to set permissions for files that are actually copied from DFS to the local file system (including any directories created in this process). This will address the issue raised in this JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-11-09T13:28:00.120+0000","updated":"2009-11-09T13:28:00.120+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439920/comment/12774989","id":"12774989","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Here's a proposal:\n- We should remove the recursive call to set permissions in TrackerDistributedCacheManager.localizeCache().\n- To handle the case for the default task controller, we can set execute permissions for all localized files and archives as done before HADOOP-4490.

Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Amarsri,  Vinod and I discussed the trunk patch a bit. The current implementation attempts to work as follows:\n- Before task launch, the task controller is launched to secure localized cache files. Previously, all files under $mapred-local-dir/$user/taskTracker/archive were secured. Obviously, we are trying to fix that in the context of this JIRA.\n- The patch lists the directories under $mapred-local-dir/$user/taskTracker/archive, (which after MAPREDUCE-1098, is the list of random id directories that were localized).\n- For each directory, if the path is not already secured, it secures it recursively.\n\nThis approach has a race condition that we identified:\n- Say a task has localized a file and has launched the task controller to secure the path, and the task controller is currently under operation.\n- In parallel, say another task localized another file into a different random id directory.\n- The task controller could get the random id directory created by the second task when it is listing directories and set permissions for it. However, this directory does not contain fully localized files and hence it would be incompletely localized.\n\nThe key problem here is that this approach does not have a real idea of what files were localized by a task as part of the distributed cache. One way to fix that would be to pass the paths to the task controller, as a list of random id directories under $mapred-local-dir/$user/taskTracker/archive that were localized in this task. This is what I suggested in the proposal above. However, there are a few problems with this proposal as well:\n\n- How do we get the list of these paths ? There's currently no way exposed by distributed cache about these files.\n- This could be a huge list, if several tens of files are being localized in a task. How would we transfer all this info to the task-controller ? A huge command line of paths to the task controller could be unmanageable, hit some command line length limits, etc. Other approaches (like transferring the info through a file) would also be cumbersome.\n- It could result in duplicate work. Say if two tasks running in parallel are sharing a file, both of them would get the random id directory to secure, and both would try and secure the path.\n\nTo solve these problems, I am proposing the following:\n- Change the directory structure for localized cache files as: $mapred-local-dir/$user/taskTracker/archive/$task-id, where task-id is for the task attempt on behalf of which localization is happening. Note that a task could use localized files that have already been localized for another task-id. Since a cache entry stores the full path for a cache key, it can retrieve this information.\n- Move securing the cache file path in the same code path as where localization of the cache files happens.\n\nThe last point is actually important in this new proposal, because without that, we might have a situation that a task could use files that have been localized by a prior task-id, but is not yet secured. And if we don't wait for that, we would have incompletely secured cache files in use.\n\nOne drawback I can think of this approach is that the new task-id directory in the path might give a wrong impression that the files localized under it are all the files used by the task in distributed cache. But clearly, files localized under other task-ids could be used as well.\n\nComments on this proposal ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-14T10:52:14.396+0000","updated":"2009-12-14T10:52:14.396+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439920/comment/12790573","id":"12790573","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"bq.

It helps in cases of abrupt TT shutdown. Admittedly, it may not be fully effective - because we would not be able to cleanup files like we do in MAPREDUCE-896 (i.e. using the task-controller's help). Still, it would cleanup whatever it can and that would be a considerable amount of space under normal conditions, I think.\n- In TrackerDistributedCacheManager.localizeCache where we construct DistributedCacheContext, I think it makes sense to just call conf.get(JobContext.USER_NAME) rather than building a new JobConf object for this one value.\n- Should we rename DistributedCacheContext to DistributedCacheFileContext, as it is operating on only one file ? Same for TaskController.initializeDistributedCache - change to initializeDistributedCacheFile. Likewise in C code as well.\n- Document DistributedCacheContext mentioning what it is useful for.\n- Store the uniqueDir as a Path object instead of a string. This is consistent with our using higher level objects like File in the Contexts.\n- Remove LOG.info print in DefaultTaskController.initializeDistributedCache. Instead have a LOG.warn in the exception handler.\n- Guard the Debug logs using LOG.isDebugEnabled.\n- Do not send full paths (as given in localizedUniqueDir) to task-controller. This is for security purposes to prevent people from sending random paths and getting permissions changed as a hack. Instead, we *hardcode* the path construction as much as possible inside the task-controller. For e.g. in this case, if we send the selected base directory (mapred-local-dir), user and random-id, we can easily construct the full path from the pattern such as $mapred-local-dir/taskTracker/$user/distcache/$random-id. This is just another safeguard in case the task-controller is compromised somehow. This naturally means the C code changes a bit as well, so the code will need to construct the path in initialize_distributed_cache and then call secure_path. Please follow the pattern we use in other methods of task-controller while doing this. Specifically:\n-- We need to validate that the passed in mapred-local-dir is valid. Please take a look at check_tt_root\n-- We also need to construct the path using methods like concatenate. Please take a look at get_attempt_directory for an example.\n- It would be very helpful to add a comment on why testDeleteCache needs to override configuration to set a single mapred local dir.\n- I would like to see a regression test for this, that ensures that file permissions are being set only for the file being localized. So can we do something like this ? Localize a file. After localization is complete, create a file under the directory where the file is localized and ensure that it has permissions different from what is set by default. Then, localize another file. After checking that the second file has the right permissions, verify that the file created after the first localization has the permissions you set and not the default permissions. This should work for both the LinuxTaskController case and the default case. \n\nAlso, I would just like you to watch for changes in MAPREDUCE-896, which I suspect will most likely clash with this patch. So, some merge may be required.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-23T04:44:09.162+0000","updated":"2009-12-23T04:44:09.162+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439920/comment/12794311","id":"12794311","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Patch incorporating almost all of review comments, except the following two.\n\nbq.

I do have some feedback though:\n\n- In the same line as removing the dead call to cleanupStorage(), should we also remove the call to this.distributedCacheManager.purgeCache() ?\n- I don't think we need to convert the random number to a positive number. Doing so actually increases the chances our random numbers could clash with previous calls. Offline, I actually just found out why you did this (*smile*). So, let's fix the other issue by passing an escape sequence for the negative number to the task controller.\n- Should we move the logic to construct the full path to the distributed cache file into DistributedCacheFileContext, in some method like getLocalizedUniqueDirectory ?\n- Previously we were setting ugo+rx for distributed cache files. In DefaultTaskController, we are changing this to only execute. I suggest we not change this. Any reason for doing so ?\n- Rename TaskCommands.INITIALIZE_DISTRIBUTEDCACHE also to TaskCommands.INITIALIZE_DISTRIBUTEDCACHEFILE.\n- localized_unique_dir in task-controller.c should be freed to release memory.\n- Instead of using the 'failed' variable as a boolean, I think you can directly set 'failed' to INITIALIZE_DISTCACHE_FAILED and return it.\n- Please add documentation to describe testCustomPermissions.\n- In testCustomPermissions, delete the hand created file in a finally block to handle cleanup during unexpected failures.
