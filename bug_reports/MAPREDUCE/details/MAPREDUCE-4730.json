Most of the memory was consumed by byte buffers, specifically it looked like most of them were RPC response buffers.\n\nI think there might be a flow control issue in the IPC layer that lead to this.  More than half of the mappers finished before the first reducer started, and thousands of reducers all launched within a few seconds of each other.  They all asked the AM for map completion task events, which currently caps the response to 10000 events per query.  Since more than 10000 maps completed before the first reducers started, each reducer saw a full event list which took around 900K for each response buffer.  There were many IPC Handler threads to service the calls, but only one Responder thread to send out the rather large response buffers.  I see there's a blocking queue to prevent too many calls from coming in at once, but I didn't see any flow control between the Handlers and the Responder thread.  It appears that as long as the Handler threads can keep up with call queue relatively low, they can continue to queue up call response data faster than the Responder thread can send it out.  Eventually this will exhaust available memory leading to an OOM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-17T23:46:04.249+0000","updated":"2012-10-17T23:46:04.249+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12612335/comment/13479257","id":"13479257","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"A little more digging and I'm a bit more confident that this is a flow control problem in the IPC layer.

Unfortunately I don't think that will work all the time due to another bug where the caller can receive less than MAX_EVENTS entries even though that many entries were processed during the call.\n\nTaskAttemptListenerImpl is calling Job.getTaskAttemptCompletionEvents with the same fromEvent and maxEvents passed in from the reducer but is then filtering the result for just map events.  This means that even though we receive maxEvents in completion events the caller could see less than that if there are one or more reducer completion event mixed in there.  Worse, if all of the events are reducer events then zero events will be reported back to the caller and it won't bump up fromEvent on the next call.  Reducer never makes progress and we're toast.  This could happen in a case where all maps complete, more than MAX_EVENTS reducers complete, but some straggling reducers get fetch failures and cause a map to be restarted.
