Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In this patch, I provide a more complete implementation for child environment variable expansion, as well as adding support for Windows. For this feature, we will have different syntaxes on Windows and Linux. I added some descriptions to the Java doc as well. For example, users can specify env via the following config on Linux.\n{code}\n<property>\n  <name>mapred.child.env</name>\n  <value>PATH=$HOME:/opt/bin</value>\n</property>\n{code}\nWhile on Windows, the equivalent will look like:\n{code}\n<property>\n  <name>mapred.child.env</name>\n  <value>PATH=%HOME%;C:\\opt\\bin</value>\n</property>\n{code}\nFor the implementation, I followed the following IEEE POSIX standards except the letter case based on some discussion with my colleagues, i.e. both uppercase and lowercase letters are allowed. From the discussion, it seems it is both common for applications on Linux and Windows to use lower case letters for environment variable, and Hadoop does not need to follow IEEE guideline.  If there are other common use cases in Hadoop community, we can expand the support as well.\n“Environment variable names used by the utilities in the Shell and Utilities volume of IEEE Std 1003.1-2001 consist solely of uppercase letters, digits, and the '_' (underscore) from the characters defined in Portable Character Set and do not begin with a digit.”\nAll matching patterns in the string are considered an environment variable, and are expanded to actual values accordingly.\n\n*Why not use existing syntax, i.e. $ and ':' (e.g. '$x=a:b'),  to set environment variables on Windows?*\nThe most common usage for the environment variables is to provide path holders for the programs, e.g. LD_LIBRARY_PATH, PATH, HOME, etc. Unlike Linux, ':' is common in Windows paths as in 'C:\\Windows'. If we use ':' as a separate for different values for the env variable, it will cause confusing during parsing.\nWe need to either choose another separator, e.g. ';' (semicolon); or escape ':' (colon). Escaping ':' is very ugly in my opinion, and also not a cross platform solution. If we follow the route to use another separator, we are already changing the existing syntax. I think using '%' instead of '$' and ';' will be more natural for Windows users. Since the paths are the most common usages of env variables, and will most likely be different on Windows and Linux, so it should be fine to ask users to adopt different settings on different platforms, since they likely need to change the path settings for different OSes anyway.\n\n\nI also refactored two related tests to make them run on Windows.

Secondly, if we know what abstract operation FOO we are doing here, then can we push it into Shell.FOO()?\n{quote}\nAbout triming leading and trailing quotes on Windows, this is due to a subtle difference of ‘set’ on cmd shell and ‘export’ on bash shell. According to the [set document|http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/bb490998] which I quoted below:\n??The characters <, >, |, &, ^ are special command shell characters and must be either preceded by the escape character (^) or enclosed in quotation marks when used in string (that is, \"StringContaining&Symbol\". If you use quotation marks to enclose a string containing one of the special characters, *the quotation marks are set as part of the environment variable value*.??\nOn Linux, quotation marks are not set as part of the environment variable by ‘export’.\nTo launch child tasks with correct environment, we setup the environment by writing a series of ‘set’ or ‘export’ command (cf. TaskRunner.run() method) to TaskController.COMMAND_FILE, and execute the file to launch the Java job (cf. DefaultTaskController.launchTask() method). So when we receive the environment variables on Windows, we need to trim the leading and ending quotes around them in the program.\nThese are not perfect solutions. However notice this is the existing behavior from the previous change which may work for majority of cases. I only changed the code to make it more concise. Let’s not push this to Shell as I think the code is simply enough to be understood and we can work towards a better abstraction for this (handling ‘set’ vs ‘export’) in the future.\n\n{quote}\nWhy this code addition? Is this a general bug you have found?\n{quote}\nNotice this is tmp directory. On Linux /tmp exists by default which is not the case on Windows.\n\n{quote}\nShould be easy to get the regex pattern for env vars from Shell?\n{quote}\nMoved to Shell in the new Patch.\n\n{quote}\nShould easily move inside Shell.getTempPath()?\n{quote}\nThe folders here are really only just text string. The test is really just testing if the environment variable is set correctly. We make them folder names to make them more like real world scenario because that is a major use of environment variable in practice.\n\n{quote}\nThis could easily use Shell.getUserHome()?\n{quote}\nAgain, the purpose here is not to get user home, but to test an environment variable. I don’t think there is a need to create Shell function for this. The environment variables are very platform dependent. So I think we should accept the platform dependence here.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chuanliu","name":"chuanliu","key":"chuanliu","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chuan Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-07-13T21:34:13.510+0000","updated":"2012-07-13T21:34:13.510+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12595956/comment/13427851","id":"13427851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.Notice this is tmp directory.

Due to the regexp pattern matching/replacing of variable expansions added by this change, environment variables are now expanded in the context of the code setting up the launch context rather than in the container itself.  For example, occurrences of $PATH, $JAVA_HOME, $LD_LIBRARY_PATH, etc. are resolved using the job client's environment when setting up the application submission context to launch the AM, and likewise variables are expanded using the AM's environment when setting up the container launch contexts for tasks.  Previously these variables were passed through un-expanded and later evaluated using the environment of the container rather than the code setting up the container launch context.\n\nWhat this means is that any occurrences of variable references in environment settings now needs to use the new \\{\\{ var \\}\\} syntax to note that these variables should only be expanded at container launch time.  Any \"normal\" variable references will be expanded with the environment of the code setting up the launch context which may not be intuitive to users, especially given prior behavior in this area (although that code itself wasn't very consistent when it came to variable expansion semantics).\n\nAnyway I wanted to bring it up in case others run into a similar snag and wondering if there's something to fix here. If we decide to keep the semantics as-is for 2.x then we should at least document the new behavior and new syntax outside of the java code, e.g.: in mapred-default.xml for the various env properties similar to what was done for mapreduce.application.classpath.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-06-09T21:11:38.327+0000","updated":"2014-06-09T21:11:38.327+0000"}],"maxResults":25,"total":25,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-4374/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i08aqf:"}}
