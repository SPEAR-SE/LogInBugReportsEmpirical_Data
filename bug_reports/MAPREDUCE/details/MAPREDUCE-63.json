Thus {{TaskRunner.runChild}}'s {{process.waitFor}} is hung, and hence {{TaskRunner.run}} cannot call {{TaskTracker.reportTaskFinished}} which is the place which sets {{TaskInProgress.runstate}} to {{SUCCEEDED}}.\nd) *10 mins* later {{TaskTracker.markUnresponsiveTasks}} marks this task as 'unresponsive' and kills it. However this might be too late since the junit test case is killed for (possibly) over-running it's 15mins limit and we have a failed test case.\n\nPhew!
