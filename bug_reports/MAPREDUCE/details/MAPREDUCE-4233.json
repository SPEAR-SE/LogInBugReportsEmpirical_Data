The cluster is kind of stuck in this case right now, although the race is also a possibility.\n\nI was curious to see what were the situations where the scheduler's node list was updated.  It is updated whenever there is a NODE_ADDED or a NODE_REMOVED event sent to the scheduler.  The NODE_ADDED events happen when a node registers for the first time, when a node reconnects, and when a node's status transitions from unhealth to healthy.  Similarly the NODE_REMOVED event is sent when a node transitions from healthy to unhealthy, when the node is deactivated, or when a node reconnects (it is removed and then added back in).  From that it appears that scheduler is intended to only store the list of healthy nodes.  By contrast the list of nodes in the RM Context is updated when nodes register, reconnect, or deactivate.  The difference between the two is unhealthy/healthy transitions.\n\nI did not dig much further to see if there was more of a disconnect between the two lists.  Especially because in the other places that access either of these node lists they check for null return values so I assumed that it was simply a missed null check here as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-05-08T19:48:08.435+0000","updated":"2012-05-08T19:48:08.435+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12554344/comment/13270776","id":"13270776","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I don't really know why the tests failed.

Nit: I would suggest adding a special value to the InfoMap in case (report == null) that corresponds to the keys: \"NumContainersMB\", \"UsedMemoryMB\" and \"AvailableMemoryMB\". Something like \"Scheduler report unavailable\". This will help identifying these cases in the node managers' statuses, on the other hand if these key/value pairs are missing from the InfoMap, there is no clue why they are missing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahmed.radwan","name":"ahmed.radwan","key":"ahmed.radwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahmed Radwan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-05-10T21:08:04.904+0000","updated":"2012-05-10T21:08:04.904+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12554344/comment/13272785","id":"13272785","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Ahmed,\n\nWe were using the capacity scheduler at the time.\n\nI debated how I should special case this, and I am fine changing it so let me know if you feel strongly about it. \n\nI thought about simply returning a 0 for NumContainers, UsedMemoryMB and AvailableMemoryMB, because that is what the true values are. no containers are running using no memory and because the node is unavailable there is no available memory.
