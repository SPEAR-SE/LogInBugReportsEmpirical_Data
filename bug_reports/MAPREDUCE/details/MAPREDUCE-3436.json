I'll summarize my understanding and please correct me if I am wrong. I think we are speaking about two separate issues:\n\nIssue1: When the user explicitly set yarn.resourcemanager.address and mapreduce.jobhistory.address, the jobhistory link is broken (without the patch), the patch basically avoids the need to explicitly set mapreduce.jobhistory.webapp.address. This issue doesn't exist in the single node case because all services run on the single node.\n\nIssue2: If the user doesn't explicitly set yarn.resourcemanager.address, then all links (AM tracking url and jobhistory url) are broken. This issue even exists on a single node setup as you mentioned (if the user tries to connect from another node). \n\nHowever, I am not sure if Issue2 is a bug or not: For a single node setup, if yarn.resourcemanager.address is not set, the user can still play with the web ui if connecting from the same single node, and all links will work. On a real cluster (multinode), it is expected/required to set the yarn.resourcemanager.address and mapreduce.jobhistory.address for the cluster to function, and so, with the patch, all links will also work.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ahmed.radwan","name":"ahmed.radwan","key":"ahmed.radwan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ahmed Radwan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-01-20T19:30:19.603+0000","updated":"2012-01-20T19:30:19.603+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532032/comment/13191354","id":"13191354","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yep, two separate issues.\n\nbq.
