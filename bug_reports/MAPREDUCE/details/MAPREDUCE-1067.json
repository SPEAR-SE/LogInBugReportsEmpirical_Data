It seems like the check is useful for preventing errors. Is there a specific reason for doing this ? For e.g. would it not be true that there could be a leaf queue given a null State on construction ? We should either prevent it in the construction or here, no ?\n- bq. Also, state of a container queue should not be allowed to change once the hierarchy is built.\nI think the way this works is when queue configuration is refreshed, a state change for container queues will result in exceptions being thrown when the QueueConfigurationParser parses and constructs Queue objects (using setState or addChild). This results in a RuntimeException that will be handled only by the IPC handler on the server. I think no useful information about the error will reach the admin. Can you please verify if this is the case ? If yes, I think it must be fixed to be handled more gracefully, and a better error message must be given. Same holds for first time construction of hierarchy as well.\n- testQueueState should be split into multiple test cases. Typically, it is good practice to test one condition / aspect of a unit in one unit test case. It makes test case maintenance easier. There are atleast 3 distinct tests I am seeing in this test case\n- The first part of the test testQueueState is verifying a message that doesn't seem correct. For e.g. I think the XML is semantically correct, but since a queue state is defined for a container queue, construction fails. Then why are we getting an exception whose message is \"Malformed xml formation queue tag and acls tags or state tags are siblings\" ? The code is incorrect if this test is passing.\n- Shouldn't there be test cases testing refresh of queue state for container queues and verify they fail ?\n- There should also be a case to test that when a queue is constructed with state stopped, and then children are added to it, an exception is thrown. It is arguable if this is the right design - i.e. we should probably have ContainerQueue as a first class citizen and then we can always prevent an invalid state for such an instance, but possibly that's a separate JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-24T05:40:41.710+0000","updated":"2009-12-24T05:40:41.710+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437368/comment/12862474","id":"12862474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"I suspect this may not be a blocker.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tomwhite","name":"tomwhite","key":"tomwhite","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tom White","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2010-04-29T23:27:07.595+0000","updated":"2010-04-29T23:27:07.595+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437368/comment/12988853","id":"12988853","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mrmagoo01","name":"mrmagoo01","key":"mrmagoo01","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Miguel Ochoa","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"A message that was in an mp3 format was made for an SCL component.
