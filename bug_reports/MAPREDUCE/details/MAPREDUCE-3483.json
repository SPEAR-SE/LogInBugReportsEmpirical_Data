In this case, it was just that one node that the reducer shouldn't have been scheduled/reserved on.  It could have been scheduled on any of the other nodes in the cluster as they (eventually) had enough memory. All the other nodes in the cluster may have been running maps from that particular job or tasks from other jobs when the reservation was made but those eventually finished and the reducer asking for 8G would have been scheduled. I thinks its a special case of don't reserve a container on a node if node memory - AM memory < requested memory that container (where the requested container is in the same job as AM).  The AM is never going to finish before the requested container so the container will never get scheduled on that node.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-11-30T14:16:55.976+0000","updated":"2011-11-30T14:16:55.976+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12533194/comment/13160276","id":"13160276","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mahadev","name":"mahadev","key":"mahadev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mahadev konar","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"MAPREDUCE-2917 actually tried to solve this exact issue.
