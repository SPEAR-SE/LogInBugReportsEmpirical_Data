The container class manages data related to queues, and not a specific Job. Maybe it should be a separate class.\n- By making JobSchedulingInfoHolder.toString to be called outside heartbeats, we are addressing the core problem in the issue. But there still exist a few calls to this method from within a JobTracker lock - like CLI APIs like getAllJobs, etc., though they occur very infrequently as compared to heartbeats. With that context, should we implement a more optimized version of toString, maybe using StringBuilder (as was suggested elsewhere).\n- The changes in JobQueue.updateStatsOnRunningJob and TaskDataView.getSlotsOccupied can be avoided, but the intent of the change can still be met, by changing the algorithm in TaskDataView.getSlotsPerTask. I am giving this idea based on preliminary patches in MAPREDUCE-1354. There, we optimized getNumSlotsPer{Map|Reduce} to be unsynchronized, by making the corresponding variables volatile. Hence, getSlotsPerTask can now be implemented as:\n{code}\nint getSlotsPerTask(JobInProgress job) {\n  return job.getNumSlotsPerMap();\n}\n{code}\nand likewise for reduces.\nThis makes it fewer changes to the patch.\n- I would suggest a few documentation changes to better document the contract of the scheduling info.\n-- Document that getSchedulingInfo returns a stringified representation of the job scheduling info set in setJobSchedulingInfo.\n-- Document that getJobSchedulingInfo will return the stringified representation of the job scheduling info on the Client, but the actual object on the server. (Note that we are deserializing the stringified representation of the scheduling info on the client, not the actual object itself)\n-- Document the intent of setJobSchedulingInfo - i.e. it is for optimization of heartbeats and allows lazy construction of the stringified representation on a need basis. This is an important design choice to capture, I think.\n- Do we need mapred.JobStatus.{get|set}JobSchedulingInfo ?

The problem lies in the way how scheduling info is managed. As of now its a push model where every change in the scheduler's state results into an info string which gets  pushed to all the jobs. Shouldn't it be a pull model wherein the jobs pull the data from the scheduler whenever required? Roughly ~100 hearbeat calls are made in a sec and in every hearbeat, the scheduler's state can potentially change resulting into an info string being pushed. That is, most of the times the info gets over-written before getting consumed making the pull model a good fit for this case.
