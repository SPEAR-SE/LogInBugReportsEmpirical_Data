I was trying to see if we should hold of this commit. I just woke up to realize that trunk is being rebased as release 0.21. Given this, and the fact that the job-acls feature a.k.a MAPREDUCE-1307 is still only 'half-complete' because of MAPREDUCE-1664 and other related minor issues. I checked with Ravi who started working on MAPREDUCE-1664 and came to know that it will not be possible to get it in by freeze date(30th?) because it involves some consensus building as well as some time for implementation.\n\nTwo things can be done. Complete MAPREDUCE-1664 by marking it as a blocker. For this we will need to know the release time lines for 0.21. Or consider job-acls as an unstable feature and *undocument* it from mapred-default.xml and forrest. The later is a plausibility not just because of MAPREDUCE-1664, but also due to other subsequent issues that arose out of this feature that we found out in internal discussions/testing. Thoughts?\n\nBTW, there must be a lot of 'half-features' like these which are originally being worked upon for 0.22 but will fall back into 0.21 because of the recent decision. For e.g., HADOOP-6568 which has become 'unstable' due to uncertainty of MAPREDUCE-1542 and HDFS-1008.\n\nWhat is the community thinking about these issues? Will need to shoot an email on general mailing list, I guess.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-04-26T13:08:05.886+0000","updated":"2010-04-26T13:08:05.886+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12459352/comment/12861359","id":"12861359","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Vinod, I was aware there are issues being worked on. In general, a feature is documented with a patch. In that sense, this JIRA simply made sure that the feature in code is documented in Forrest. Is there anything that was documented that was incorrect ? If yes, that's a bug in documentation and should be fixed. If everything written was technically correct, but the feature has gotchas itself, I suppose one option would be to call out the gotchas in the documentation and thus make it more user-friendly and warn users about potential issues. AFAIK, the adjustments being made are not going to drastically change what has been documented. So most of the documentation should still hold.
