This is a client-side behavior, over-ridable by your MultipleOutputFormat derivative {{(@Override checkOutputSpecs)}}. This isn't a hadoop issue per se, cause the default check to FileOutputFormat was added with safety-first principles in mind, but as I mentioned already, its over-ridable by developers.
