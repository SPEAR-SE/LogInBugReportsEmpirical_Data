The main goal here is to provide a way for Oozie to be able to maintain a bit more of a semblance of backwards compatibility even after MAPREDUCE-4549 goes in.  They essentially want to de-dupe the entires in the dist cache that would cause an error.  We originally decided on having a exception thrown because it would allow for other errors/checks that may show up in the future to also be added in.  I don't think there would be a problem with adding in a new API that throws an exception if that API was also added into the 1.x line as well, but perhaps did not throw anything because there are not the same limitations.\n\nI realize that adding in new APIs, especially since we already have 3 classes that have these types of APIs in them, is not ideal, but it is the only way to maintain backwards compatibility and evolve the API.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-10-09T16:40:14.930+0000","updated":"2012-10-09T16:40:14.930+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604105/comment/13472981","id":"13472981","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"In addition, it will be better, if there is a way of checking whether some file is already added in DC.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kamrul","name":"kamrul","key":"kamrul","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mohammad Kamrul Islam","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-10-10T04:29:14.259+0000","updated":"2012-10-10T04:29:14.259+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12604105/comment/13473271","id":"13473271","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Adding a true duplicate, exact same file multiple times, to the dist cache will not result in an error under YARN.
