Introduced a new test class TestSetupTaskScheduling to test these conditions. Verified without the code fix the corresponding tests fail.\n\nArun and I felt that changing the usage in other schedulers from using slots to tasks is probably best left to a different jira as the impact needs to be more carefully studied, and this is a simple bug that only affects setup and cleanup tasks in the case of capacity scheduler right now.\n\nI plan to run a real cluster test tomorrow manually to ensure things work fine still.
