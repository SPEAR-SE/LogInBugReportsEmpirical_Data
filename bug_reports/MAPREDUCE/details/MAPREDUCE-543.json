deficit based scheduling causes pending jobs to rise up in priority (effectively). especially when such jobs are large - they tend to hog the cluster once they can be scheduled. \n\ni guess this does beg the question of why a large deficit was accumulated in the first place (and that maybe due to a bug) - but this does seem to call for some solution in any case.\n\none of the things that i think u had mentioned would make sense - instead of giving all incoming slots to a task with a large deficit - give it a large enough fraction so that it's 'catching up'. one way could be to assign additional weight multiplicator that's proportional to the deficit. this should leave some slots on an ongoing basis to new jobs without a lot of deficit. thoughts?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jsensarma","name":"jsensarma","key":"jsensarma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joydeep Sen Sarma","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2008-12-15T18:37:47.349+0000","updated":"2008-12-15T18:37:47.349+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410206/comment/12656738","id":"12656738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I agree, I think the \"catching up\" idea could help here.

Instead, we should give it a more moderate share - enough that it can \"catch up\" at a reasonable time.

The last time each pool was at its min / fair share is already being maintained by the preemption patch (HADOOP-4665), so it won't be much work. One other benefit of this change will be that jobs will tend to reuse the same slot more often, leading to more JVM reuse. This can be a bad thing if it leads to poor locality, but HADOOP-4667 will ensure that a job keeps using a node till it runs out of local blocks to read on that node, and then waits and switches to hopefully a node where it has more local data to process. This should give us the best of both JVM reuse and data locality. (When I talked to Arun and Owen about the use of deficits in the fair scheduler before, they were concerned that it may lead to less JVM reuse because jobs will jump between slots more often.)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-02-09T04:11:19.997+0000","updated":"2009-02-09T04:11:19.997+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410206/comment/12716087","id":"12716087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"A note on progress for this issue: I have a tested patch that removes deficits and also adds support for FIFO pools, but I am waiting for HADOOP-4665 and HADOOP-4667 to be committed before posting it because it depends on those.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-03T22:25:34.677+0000","updated":"2009-06-03T22:25:34.677+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12410206/comment/12775325","id":"12775325","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This was incorporated into MAPREDUCE-706, right?
