I believe the MergeManager and MapOutput classes are being used by third-party software like SyncSort, see MAPREDUCE-4808, MAPREDUCE-4039, and related JIRAs.  By changing the input stream being passed to mapOutput.shuffle to an IFileInputStream then calling read() on the data subtly changes the behavior.  Before it was an IFileInput stream, calling read() would read all the data and the checksum.  After it's wrapped at a higher level it won't.  If the third-party software is itself wrapping the stream with IFileInputStream to handle the trailing checksum then after this change the stream would be double-wrapped and checksum verification would fail.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-11-24T14:18:55.280+0000","updated":"2014-11-24T14:18:55.280+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12756431/comment/14223368","id":"14223368","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira.shegalov","name":"jira.shegalov","key":"jira.shegalov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gera Shegalov","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi [~jlowe], thanks for pointing out the 3rd-party use cases, I completely forgot about it.

Some are in light of a follow-up JIRA. \nbq. update this patch with the final keyword on JobConf jobConf\nLet us make the instance variable type a more general {{Configuration}} as we are not doing anything specific to {{JobConf}}.\n\nInstead of introducing a new local variable iFin in {{OnDiskMapOutput#shuffle}}, we can overwrite it as in {{InMemoryMapOutput#shuffle}}.\nWe can either capture the shuffle size in an instance variable as {{InMemoryMapOutput}} does implicitly via {{memory.length}}. Or we can set \n{code}\nlong bytesLeft = compressedLength - ((IFileInputStream)input).getSize()\n{code}\nThen we don't need to touch the line {{input.read}} to do {{readWithChecksum}}\n\nGood call adding {{finally}} with {{close}}.\n\nI also have some comments for the test:\n{{ios.finish()}} should be removed because it's redundant: {{IFileOutputStream#close()}} will call it as well.\n\nWe don't need PrintStream wrapping and we need to be careful not to leak file descriptors in case I/O fails.\n{code}\n   new PrintStream(fout).print(bout.toString());\n   fout.close();\n{code}\nShould be something like:\n{code}\n    try {\n      fout.write(bout.toByteArray());\n    } finally {\n      fout.close();\n    }\n{code}\n\nSimilarly we need to make sure that {{fin.close()}} is in a try-finally block enclosing header and shuffle read.\nLet us not do\n{code}\n catch(Exception e) {\n     fail(\"OnDiskMapOutput.shuffle did not process the map partition file\");\n{code}\nIt's redundant because the exception is failing the test already.\n\nSame PrintStream and fout.close remarks for the code creating the corrupted file\n{{dataSize/2}}: I believe Sun Java Coding Style require spaces around arithmetic operations.\n\nIn the fragment where we expect the checksum to fail, {{fin.close()}} should be in some finally.\n{{catch(Exception e)}} is too broad. Let us be more specific and maybe even log it:\n{code}\n      } catch(ChecksumException e) {\n        LOG.info(\"Expected checksum exception thrown.\", e);\n      }\n{code} \n\nThinking a bit more about the file.out, it does not seem to be cleaned up after the test has finished. But we probably don't even need to create files, we can simply use {{new ByteArrayInputStream(bout.toByteArray())}} and {{new ByteArrayInputStream(corrupted)}} as input.

Since OnDiskMapOutput is shuffling the whole IFile to disk, the checksum is needed later during the last merge pass when the IFile contents are read again and decompressed.\n\nCan you clarify where in the code it's required to keep the original checksum?\n\nWhat I see is that after your modifications, {{OnDiskMapOutput}} is guaranteed to validate the contents of the destination buffer against the remote checksum. Then this contents are written out using {{LocalFileSystem}}, which will create again an on-disk checksum because it's based on {{ChecksumFileSystem}}. Are you proposing an optimization that the checksum is not computed twice when shuffling straight to disk by using {{RawLocalFileSystem}}?
