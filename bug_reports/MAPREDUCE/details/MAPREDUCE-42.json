Fixing those problems (and we _have_ fixed most of them over the last 4 months) should take precendence. However, that said, I think in the long term, we do want something like this patch. If a switch goes down for 15 minutes and then comes back up, it does not make sense to reshuffle, resort, and rerun a reduce that takes hours to run.\n\nAll map/reduce applications, even those with speculative execution turned off, must permit redundant copies of their tasks for precisely this reason. In this case, the JobTracker has decided a given task is dead, but hasn't been able to tell the responsible TaskTracker yet. Therefore it schedules another instance of the failed task on a different node. Therefore, they are going to run in parallel for a while.\n\nI guess for now, let's sit on this patch and contemplate what the model should be for dealing with communication problems.
