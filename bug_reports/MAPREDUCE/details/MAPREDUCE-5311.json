If these counters are deprecated, we need to create something more appropriate to replace them so users can still track cluster utilization.\n\nI would like to see some sort of \"resource-millis\" counters so we can track the amount of time a job was consuming a particular cluster resource and how much of that resource during that time.  So memory would be tracked via MB-millis or GB-millis, CPU could be core-millis or vcore-millis, etc.  It would be great if this was tracked by YARN directly and available regardless of the app framework used, but that's a much bigger change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-10T14:35:33.303+0000","updated":"2013-06-10T14:35:33.303+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651826/comment/13679649","id":"13679649","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"[~acmurthy], [~jlowe], [~sseth].

Independent of YARN-1004, the current way of calculating it is a hack that neither adheres to its behavior in MR1 nor its description.\n\nIn MR1, it was calculated as the sum of all map task's running times multiplied by the number of slots each task took up.\n\nThe description, \"Total time spent by all maps in occupied slots (ms)\", with its unit being ms and not slots-ms, reads to me as a sum of all map task's running times, independent of the number of slots consumed by each. \n\nOn most clusters, however, these were equivalent, because a map task would only take up more than one slot if mapred.cluster.map.memory.mb were set to something other than its default, -1.\n\nThe MR2 counter, which is calculated as the sum of all map task's running times multiplied by the memory allocated by each one, divided by the minimum allocation, adheres to neither of these.  The average MR1 user who did not set mapred.cluster.map.memory.mb will find, upon upgrading the MR2, that SLOTS_MILLIS_MAPS functions differently than it did in MR1, as well as be confused by YARN's claim that it gets rid of slots.\n\nThis is not an obscure feature.  It's one of the things that any person running a MapReduce job will see, and I think keeping it in its current form will help to confuse those who are trying to upgrade to MR2 and understand the new resource model.

Essentially SLOTS_MILLIS_MAPS functions as CONTAINERS_MILLIS_MAPS would and is computed independently from container capabilities.  This will break semantic compatibility in some cases for people using the mapred.cluster.(map,reduce).memory.mb properties, but it will restore semantic compatibility for people not using those properties (which I believe is a much larger number).

Defining SLOTS_MILLIS to be the same as CONTAINER_MILLIS will break compatibility for the minority of clusters that both used the mapred.cluster.map.memory.mb property in MR1 and chose to configure memory in MR2 in a way that exactly lines up with slots in MR1 (i.e. setting yarn.scheduler.minimum-allocation-mb to exactly the same as mapred.cluster.map.memory.mb, which is often not the right choice).\n\nIt will also break compatibility for those on 0.23 where SLOT_MILLIS is currently based on the minimum allocation.  Changing the units from slots to containers for those cases will significantly lower the reported value and could be misinterpreted as lower cluster utilization.  That's why I'm not in favor of changing the SLOT_MILLIS units but still calling it SLOT_MILLIS.  I'd rather the counter disappear than have it be a completely wrong value.  As Arun mentioned, there are in-house tools to compute cluster utilization based on these metrics.\n\nI agree that supporting SLOT_MILLIS long-term is problematic due to the removal of the minimum or slot concept, hence my earlier suggestion for something more supportable like MEM_MILLIS or CPU_MILLIS.  For backwards compatibility, we could consider doing something along the lines of what it's already doing today, i.e.: having the AM read a config and computing the \"slot\" size from there.  That way admins can configure whatever is appropriate for a \"slot\" for their cluster to keep legacy tools reporting something appropriate when they try to look for SLOT_MILLIS.  If the property is not configured then arguably the AM should not report a SLOT_MILLIS job counter since it doesn't know how big a slot should be.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-08-13T22:10:09.352+0000","updated":"2013-08-13T22:10:09.352+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651826/comment/13739043","id":"13739043","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"[~jlowe], thanks for jumping in, I was no aware you guys have in-house tools using this stuff with the current reported SLOT_MILLIS.

Of course, we can revisit both for 2.1.1 via deprecation of yarn.scheduler.min being discussed in YARN-1004. \n\nI'll stress that we can continue talking and get both in once we all agree.\n\nMy plan is to cut an rc2 by noon PST tmrw (9/15).

This is used by schedulers to do their internal logic. MR AM uses this same config. This is not optimal but has the virtue of being simple and relatively error free since there is only 1 config to change.\n\nIf we change yarn.min to yarn.sched-name.min and introduce mr.min for MR then who will keep both of these in sync. Also the sync value depends on the scheduler being currently used. This is also sub optimal but is less preferable than the former because 1) new config 2) manual synch of 2 configs based on scheduler being used. \n\nIf YARN-1004 doesnt touch yarn.min then we are good. Currently both schedulers are using the min values and will probably continue to use it for the foreseeable future. IMO yarn.max is not scheduler specific. Its an admin config that must be enforced by any scheduler. Lets just leave these configs as they are because removing them is causing more grief than gain (including this jira). And let MR use these configs to do internal calculations. I wish we had more foresight earlier and done the right thing for slot_millis when we wrote the original code.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-15T06:05:54.734+0000","updated":"2013-08-15T06:05:54.734+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651826/comment/13741564","id":"13741564","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Given the conclusions here and on YARN-1004, resolving this as \"won't fix\".
