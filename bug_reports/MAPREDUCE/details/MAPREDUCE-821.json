This results in the driver job leaking file descriptors and will eventually crash once the OS limit is reached for Too Many Open Files.\n\nThis has been verified in Hadoop 18.3 by running the driver and as new MapReduce jobs are run, lsof -p dhows an increasing number of open TCP connections to the cluster.\n\nLooking at the current code in the trunk, it looks like this is caused by runJob not calling close() on the JobClient object it creates. Or alternatively, it's cause by the fact that JobClient does not have a destructor that calls close().\n\nI am going to verify this hypothesis and post a patch.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"1h","remainingEstimate":"1h","originalEstimateSeconds":3600,"remainingEstimateSeconds":3600},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":3600,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"111312","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JobClient.runJob leaks file descriptors","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdesnoyer","name":"mdesnoyer","key":"mdesnoyer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Desnoyer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mdesnoyer","name":"mdesnoyer","key":"mdesnoyer","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mark Desnoyer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":3600,"percent":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Driver running on Ubuntu Jaunty x86, cluster running a Linux variant.
