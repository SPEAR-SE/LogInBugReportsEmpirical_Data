When the job submit rate is low (lower then one job in several seconds) tracker's working without a problem. When the job rate is high the following problem occurs:\n\nInside submitJob() JT copies job jar + xml to local filesystem. After that it's doing \"chmod\" on those files. Hadoop does chmod  by spawning child process. When JT heap is big (like several gigabytes) spawning child process takes a lot of time (because java calls fork()) â€” in our case it's about 1-2 seconds. So job tracker can't handle high frequency job submits.\n\nExcept of that, as heartbeat() method is also synchronized JT stops to process heart-beat as \"this\" monitor is being held by submit job. That makes JT thins that a lot of TaskTrackers are down.\n\nFollowing solution could help:\n\n\"chmod\" is being called from submitJob() method under following line:\n\nJobInProgress job = new JobInProgress(jobId, this, this.conf);\n\nThis block could be taken away from synchronized code:\n\npublic JobStatus submitJob(JobID jobId) throws IOException {\n    synchronized (this) {\n        .... the rest\n    }\n\n    //here we're leaving this line outside syncronized code as it doesn't relate\n    //on state of JobTracker.
