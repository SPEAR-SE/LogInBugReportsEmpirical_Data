At that point it can decide which of the cases it is in and react properly.  That would also solve similar problems that exist for custom, multi-byte delimiters that span block boundaries.\n\nCurrently the line reader is buffered, and it would be a shame to have to give that up.  I think we can still use buffered reads from the codec stream with one critical assumption: the codec will *never* return data spanning two blocks in a single read.  I'm assuming that's the case today, since failure to do that would break the existing LineRecordReader->LineReader->SplittableCompressionCodec relationship today.  LineReader is buffering data from the codec, but LineRecordReader is checking the codec's position after each record returned.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-06T21:57:01.992+0000","updated":"2013-06-06T21:57:01.992+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651208/comment/13678536","id":"13678536","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Attaching a draft of a patch that I believe will fix the issue.  Comments welcome.\n\nI no longer believe this is a codec issue, since the codec doesn't know anything about record delimiters.  The codec is properly reporting when the next split has started to be read.  The problem actually lies between the LineRecordReader and LineReader when the codec is involved, as the LineRecordReader is relying solely on the codec to report when the split has completed, oblivious to the buffering and peeking going on in LineReader.  If others agree, I can move this to a MAPREDUCE JIRA.\n\nThe patch makes the LineRecordReader aware of the fact that the split ended in the middle of a delimiter, so it can decide to read another record after the codec reports the split ended.\n\nAdded some unit tests which uses a couple of test files that I'm also attaching.  These need to be dropped into hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/test/resources/ so the unit tests can find them.\n\nAny feedback is appreciated.

The custom delimiter support does not allow a subset of the specified delimiter to be a valid delimiter as well, so it won't recognize the start of the characters as a delimiter and will read an extra line before starting.\n\nbq. I looked briefly at the custom delimiter code, and I'm not seeing how it handles splits that start in the middle of a delimiter. I must be missing something obvious...\n\nYeah, it does look like there's a problem with the handling of custom record delimiters on uncompressed input.  For this to work properly we need the consumer of the previous split to handle all bytes up to and including the first full record delimiter that starts at or after its split ends.  With this patch I think we have this case covered for compressed input due to the needAdditionalRecordAfterSplit logic.  However since the custom delimiter line reader seems to be returning the size of the record and subsequent delimiter bytes as the bytes consumed, I think we will end up reporting the end of the split too early to the LineRecordReader for uncompressed data in the case where the delimiter straddles the split boundary.\n\nTo verify there's a problem, I ran a simple wordcount on the following input data:\n\n{noformat}\n\nabcxxx\ndefxxx\nghixxx\njklxxx\nmnoxxx\npqrxxx\nstuxxx\nvw xxx\nxyzxxx\n{noformat}\n\nand then I ran it with the options {{-Dmapreduce.input.fileinputformat.split.maxsize=34 -Dtextinputformat.record.delimiter=xxx}}.  The resulting output looked like this:\n\n{noformat}\nabc\t1\ndef\t1\nghi\t1\njkl\t1\nmno\t1\nstu\t1\nvw\t1\nxyz\t1\n{noformat}\n\nSo we dropped the \"pqr\" record.  Not good.\n\nI'm tempted to handle this as a separate JIRA since I believe this will be an issue only with uncompressed inputs after this patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-11-18T22:23:39.043+0000","updated":"2013-11-18T22:23:39.043+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651208/comment/13826352","id":"13826352","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Those tests are really integration tests rather than unit tests, since they're running a job for each test rather than just the LineRecordReader in isolation.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-11-21T14:59:23.927+0000","updated":"2013-11-21T14:59:23.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651208/comment/13829028","id":"13829028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thats sounds better jason. \n+1 for the existing patch then.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2013-11-21T15:33:45.166+0000","updated":"2013-11-21T15:33:45.166+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12651208/comment/13832969","id":"13832969","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Cleanup work in preparation for commit.
