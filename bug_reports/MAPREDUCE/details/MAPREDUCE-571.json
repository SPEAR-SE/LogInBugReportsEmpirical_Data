It should catch all exceptions and provide a human readable error message.\nCommon exceptions caused by common user mistakes should be explained by these messages.  \n\nRationalization:\nWhen a user tries to execute a Perl script and sees a Java stack trace, she immediately assumes that the tools is broken.  \nI have obsereved this ssepcifically trying to get people to use Streaming.\n\nUnlike some other Hadoop components that are supposed to be used Java code, Streaming is a user facing application.
