But:\n\n- the number of total bytes is computed by summing up the uncompressed segment sizes (_Merger.Segment.getRawDataLength()_)\n\n- the number of processed bytes is computed by exploiting the position of the current _IFile.Reader_ (using _IFile.Reader.getPosition()_) but this may refer to the position in the underlying on disk file (which may be compressed)\n\nThus, if the map outputs are compressed then the progress may be underestimated (e.g., only 1 map output ondisk file, the compressed file is 25% of its original size, then the reduce task progress during the reduce phase will range between 0 and 0.25 and then artificially jump to 1.0).\n\nAttached there is a patch: the number of processed bytes is now computed by exploiting _IFile.Reader.bytesRead_ (if the the reader is in memory, then _getPosition()_ already returns exactly this field).\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12327180","id":"12327180","description":"2.6.0

We just ran across this as well, and my apologies for missing this earlier.  Looks like this was caused by MAPREDUCE-2264 when the getRawDataLength stuff was added.\n\nPatch looks good overall, and I manually verified it fixes the issue with compressed map outputs.  However it would be nice to have a unit test to verify this doesn't break again in the future.  I see there's already unit tests in TestMerger that were intended to test this, but the tests are ineffective because they create no segments.  The {{for (int i = 1; i < 1; i++)}} code in the test ends up creating no segments so nothing is merged.\n\n[~sandyr] [~devaraj.k], could you also take a look since you were familiar with the changes in MAPREDUCE-2264?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-10T19:12:31.374+0000","updated":"2014-10-10T19:12:31.374+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12725579/comment/14167361","id":"14167361","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
