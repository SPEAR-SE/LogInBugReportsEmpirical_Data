Sorry for missing this in the review of MAPREDUCE-5891.\n\nRather than throwing the original IOException when we stop retrying, it might be more informative to wrap it with a message stating how many attempts and how long we waited total to try to connect.  Otherwise we could throw a socket timeout exception indicated we only waited 1ms depending upon how the attempts lined up with the retries.\n\nSpeaking of trying up to the retry timeout, we're computing a potentially lower connection timeout value based on the amount of time left in total retry time but then we could end up sleeping most of that time away just below.  Arguably we should be computing the socket timeout time just before we try to connect rather than just after we received the error.\n\nI don't think we should always ignore InterruptedException.  That's probably what we'll get when the Fetcher threads are trying to be shut down, so I think we should return if {{stopped==true}} when that's received.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-11-12T15:54:02.183+0000","updated":"2014-11-12T15:54:02.183+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12754649/comment/14208913","id":"14208913","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"One other bit.
