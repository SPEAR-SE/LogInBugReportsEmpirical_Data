I could definitely be wrong so if someone could confirm my analysis on this I would appreciate it.\n\nSo there are two places where we could get issues.  The first is because we get the file size after writing and without closing the file.  This is not a huge issue because that size is only used to approximate how much space will be needed for the final merge file, which we just wrote out so who cares.\n\nThe second case is a race between writing the merge data out to a file and reading it back in.  This will only happen on the final merge when the reducer has too much buffered in memory and we need to spill to disk (we exceeded mapred.job.reduce.input.buffer.percent).  But even then it becomes a race between java's buffered IO getting pushed out to disk and another part of the code reading it back in.  I have a hard time believing that we are going to lose that race ever.  i think we can move the back to major, sorry about scaring everyone.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-11T21:21:21.915+0000","updated":"2013-01-11T21:21:21.915+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627034/comment/13553914","id":"13553914","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Sandy - have you seen this in branch-2?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-01-15T15:46:14.123+0000","updated":"2013-01-15T15:46:14.123+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12627034/comment/13554134","id":"13554134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sandyr","name":"sandyr","key":"sandyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sandy Ryza","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"It's not a problem in branch-2.
