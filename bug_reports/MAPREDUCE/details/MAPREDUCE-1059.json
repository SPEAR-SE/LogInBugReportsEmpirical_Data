files. SequenceFile sync points are not distributed through the transfer list file in the correct locations. Consequently, many mappers do not have any work to do, as their transfer lists are subsumed by adjacent map tasks in the file.\n\nThis patch causes the transfer list file to be rewritten as part of the splitting process, with sync() points inserted at the correct boundaries between map tasks.\n\nThis patch also includes tests of the split algorithm which apply the splitting process to several different sets of file sizes. The old process can generate lists of splits in which up to 75% of the mappers do no work. The new process guarantees a better distribution of files over mappers.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-10-05T23:50:15.524+0000","updated":"2009-10-05T23:50:15.524+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437328/comment/12762492","id":"12762492","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

The split points inserted into the existing file are simply done at points which have nothing to do with the user's chosen target map task size.

This patch changes this to query the configuration for distcp.bytes.per.map.\n\nTo verify this works: run a distcp job transferring 100 files of 1 KB: {{hadoop distcp -Ddistcp.bytes.per.map=100 srcpath dstpath}}.\n\nOn a pseudo-distributed cluster, Hadoop will generate 20 tasks (the task max of 20 tasks/node will limit the target number of tasks). Then ten of these tasks will transfer files, ten will transfer none because their splits contained no sync points. With this patch, all 20 tasks will transfer 5 files each.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-12-18T03:24:19.770+0000","updated":"2009-12-18T03:24:19.770+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437328/comment/12792802","id":"12792802","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
