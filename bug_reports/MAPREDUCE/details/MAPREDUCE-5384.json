The previous patch is likely better. One concern with the current patch - 'cancelled' is associated with the current RenewalTimerTask.

It looks like a cancel while a RenewalTimer is running, will still lead to an additional Renewal being scheduled for the same token, which is the same behaviour without the patch. Have some concerns with synchronization / thread safety in the patch as well - leaving those out.\n\nInstead of the relatively large changes in the patch, I think it'll be a lot simpler to just associate a 'cancel'/'intentToCancel' flag with the token to prevent renewal attempts after a cancel is called. The in-process renew can check these till the last moment before invoking the actual renew, and subsequent renewals will not attempt a renew (maybe even not schedule a renew). The changes to the unit test will likely still be required - to allow the one extra in-flight renew.\n\nDo you know if this problem exists in the 2.x renewer as well ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-20T21:00:31.982+0000","updated":"2013-08-20T21:00:31.982+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12657320/comment/13770122","id":"13770122","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks much, Sid.
