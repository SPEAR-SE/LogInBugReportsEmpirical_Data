They also run tests as a different user from the one firing the ant test target. If you notice these tests take some special parameters - a path to a binary file and a user identity. HADOOP-5771 introduced these tests for the first time into the system.\n\nIn the ant build scripts, we only build the task-controller binary, but the step of making it a setuid is manually done in environments which use this feature. We did not know of a good way to automate this process on Hudson. And the tests do not make sense without this binary and/or user identity. They essentially exist to make sure the task-controller function works correctly in being able to run tasks as another user. \n\nRather than completely ignoring automated testing because of these various limitations, we thought of still providing a facility by which atleast developers working on these features can have a way of testing them in an automated fashion, even if they mean, they have to run it 'specially'. Essentially, having something was better than having nothing.\n\nAll this said, we absolutely *hate* not being able to run these tests in the right way on Hudson. I would appreciate any help / suggestions you can offer to fix this issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-01-30T05:22:45.301+0000","updated":"2010-01-30T05:22:45.301+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12446994/comment/12828954","id":"12828954","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
