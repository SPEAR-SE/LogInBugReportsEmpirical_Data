You're probably familiar with how it can happen (if so I apologize), but let me put it down still.\n\nSuppose we set the job classloader just prior to starting jobs. And suppose the app master decides to start a new jetty-based server *after* that point in time. Normally all the jetty classes would have been loaded (including the configuration class). But suppose it triggers a code path that wasn't exercised yet which uses the *context classloader* (getContextClassLoader()). This would now return the job classloader. If that class calls code like this, you would get a ClassCastException:\n\n{code}\nClassLoader cl = Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader();\n// Foo was loaded by the app classloader previously\n// FooImpl will be loaded by a different classloader\n// this line will throw a ClassCastException\nFoo foo = (Foo)Class.forName(\"org.jetty.foo.impl.FooImpl\", cl); // or (Foo)cl.loadClass(\"org.jetty.foo.impl.FooImpl\")\n{code}\n\nFor the problem to surface, it would need to meet all of the following conditions:\n- its classes are loaded through the app classloader (i.e. the code path is outside the user task code path)\n- it uses the context classloader *after* it has been set to the job classloader\n- it tries to load another class (of its own) using that context classloader\n- it tries to cast it to its own type (interface or base class) that's already been loaded by the app classloader\n\nIt is pretty hard to get into all of these. But it does happen, and the above code pattern for jetty was one. Another library that I know of that uses the context classloader is jaxb (already included in the system classes). So by including jetty in the system classes we gain just a bit more safety.\n\nThis is bit of trial and error. But we do know what hadoop may do outside the user code, and hopefully this list does not need to grow.\n\nMy 2 cents...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-07T17:38:54.192+0000","updated":"2014-03-07T17:38:54.192+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694351/comment/13924217","id":"13924217","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Yeah, that makes sense.

If a user-provided jetty is not likely to break then I'm thinking we shouldn't preclude it by default as that means the user doesn't get the jetty they expect.\n\nI thought by initializing the job classloader after we've started services that we should have avoided our jetty instance from trying to load the user-provided jetty classes.  Since we are going to start the jetty services before setting the job classloader, I thought those jetty threads won't have the job classloader as their context classloader and therefore not be affected by any user-provided jetty jars.  The AM is the only MR framework piece that uses jetty within a job, and we should know exactly what it will do and when it will init relative to user code. \n\nI doubt many users will be starting jetty in their OutputCommitter code that runs in the AM, and therefore it seemed likely that mixing the two jetty versions and using the job classloader feature would work as intended.  The AM would get Hadoop's jetty version and tasks would get the user's version.  If it's likely to work then I don't see a need to preclude it by default and make most users discover and change the system classes property to get what they want in the majority of the cases.\n\nNow if the user code starts up jetty inside the AM (i.e.: within their OutputCommitter which seems weird but who knows) or if it's an uber job then we probably have issues there.\n\nAnyway I'm far from a classloader or jetty expert.  If you guys agree that jetty should be in the system classes by default for MR jobs then that's probably a good thing.  It's definitely the safer thing from the framework perspective since we know we'll get what the framework wants (barring user.classpath.first shenanigans).  I just didn't want to preclude by default users from using a different jetty version than Hadoop's dependency if it is likely to work for most cases.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-03-07T19:03:28.633+0000","updated":"2014-03-07T19:03:28.633+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12694351/comment/13924231","id":"13924231","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"You have convinced me on this. :) Yes, I agree there is value in allowing users to run their own jetty version (as that is one of the very values that the isolated classloader provides) if they choose to do so.
