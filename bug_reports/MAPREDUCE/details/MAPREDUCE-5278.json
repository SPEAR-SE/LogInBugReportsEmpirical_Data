To prevent leak of the storage account credentials to the user's storage account; \n2. It uses HDFS for the transient job files what is good for two reasons – a) it does not flood the user's storage account with irrelevant data/files b) it leverages HDFS locality for small files\n\nHowever, this approach conflicts with how distributed cache caching works, completely negating the feature's functionality.\n\nWhen files are added to the distributed cache (thru files/achieves/libjars hadoop generic options), they are copied to the job tracker staging dir only if they reside on a file system different that the jobtracker's. Later on, this path is used as a \"key\" to cache the files locally on the tasktracker's machine, and avoid localization (download/unzip) of the distributed cache files if they are already localized.\n\nIn this configuration the caching is completely disabled and we always end up copying dist cache files to the job tracker's staging dir first and localizing them on the task tracker machine second.\n\nThis is especially not good for Oozie scenarios as Oozie uses dist cache to populate Hive/Pig jars throughout the

tracker's staging (see JobClient#copyRemoteFiles() ). \n\nFor example, in HDInsight, user storage would be ASV which is different than HDFS. So by default these files would be copied to JT. However, since ASV is supposed to be reachable from tasktracker, these copy operations would be unnecessary, which will also disable the dist cache.  A proposal is to add a configuration property (e.g. \"mapred.tasktracker.scheme.accessible\"). If we specify a scheme in this property, we won't do the copy operation even if this scheme is not equal to the scheme of job tracker's staging dir.

For your question : \"Is the following code (marked below) continuing to copy stuff to the default fs (fs) when the newPath points to a different filesystem?:\n\nNo. Basically, the original code does this: If JT staging dir is not on the default FS (for example, in our context it is ASV), copyRemoteFiles() will copy files in ASV to JT. Note that these files are specified using generic options.\nAfter our change, when ASV is marked as \"accessible\" by specifying \"mapreduce.client.accessible.remote.schemes\",  copyRemoteFiles() won't copy the files in ASV  to the jobtracker. It just directly returns the path of that file, denoted by \"newPath\".  In addition, no copy operation would happen in addArchiveToClassPath().
