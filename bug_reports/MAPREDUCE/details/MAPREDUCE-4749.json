But the common case is much faster then the worst case, not that it is much comfort when you hit the worst case :). We could mitigate this by dropping the wait time to something smaller like 100ms so it would take 50 times as many events to slow it down the same amount.\n\nI also agree that the tight loop will only happen when *ALL* the present actions in the queue are tainted. But I don't agree that it should be rare.  I think it is quite common to have a single event in the queue, or to have all of the events in the queue to be for a single job that is localizing.  Especially if all of the other jobs on this node are done localizing so their events get processed quickly and removed from the queue. The only time the thread would not be running is when the queue is empty.  I have not collected any real world numbers so I don't know how often that actually is in practice, or what percentage of the running time is just for checking.  If you feel that the extra CPU utilization is worth this then go ahead and remove the wait.  I am not opposed to it. I just wanted to point out the consequences of doing so. Also if you remove the wait, we should look at if we can remove the notify calls from the job as well.  If no one is ever going to wait the notifys become dead code. \n\nThat being said, I agree with you Vinod that having separate queues is a better solution over all, but it is also a much larger change.  One that I don't know would provide that much more benefit compared to the risk of such a change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-01T16:22:33.630+0000","updated":"2012-11-01T16:22:33.630+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613414/comment/13489038","id":"13489038","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitgupta","name":"arpitgupta","key":"arpitgupta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Attached another patch where there are two queues and also make sure duplicate entries did not make it in to the queue.

So please either change the wait to a sleep, or add in a call to taskCleanupThread.notifyAll() at about the same place that rjob.notifyAll() is happening. As part of that too you will need to synchronize with the taskCleanupThread before calling notifyAll. You will probably also want to synchronize around the wait, but be careful so you get the locking order consistent between rjob and taskCleanupThread, or leave the two notify/lock pairs separate which might be simpler.\n\nI decided to change the wait to a Thread.sleep in the task clean up and removed the rjob.notifyAll\n\n\nAlso I had to restructure the code a bit so that i could write unit tests to cover various scenarios.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitgupta","name":"arpitgupta","key":"arpitgupta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-03T00:46:28.791+0000","updated":"2012-11-03T00:46:28.791+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613414/comment/13489887","id":"13489887","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitgupta","name":"arpitgupta","key":"arpitgupta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"oops left an un used import.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitgupta","name":"arpitgupta","key":"arpitgupta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-03T00:56:11.266+0000","updated":"2012-11-03T00:56:11.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12613414/comment/13489892","id":"13489892","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=arpitgupta","name":"arpitgupta","key":"arpitgupta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arpit Gupta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ran the test that was failing before with this patch attached and it worked.
