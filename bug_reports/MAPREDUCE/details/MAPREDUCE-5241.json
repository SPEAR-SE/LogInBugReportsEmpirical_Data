And a user submits a job with 5 maps to pool A and the 5 maps starts to run immediately. After update() in UpdateThread.run() is executed, pool A gets map shares of 5, and pool A has 5 running map tasks. Before preemptTasksIfNecessary() is called, a speculative map task could be started, and pool A has 6 running map tasks now, but still gets map shares of 5, so the new speculative map task could be preempted. For the number of running map tasks(6)is still less than the pool A's minimun shares(10), probably it is wrong to preempt any tasks from pool A. A possible fix is to make the call to update() and preemptTasksIfNecessary() atomic to eliminate the race condition, and the following is the first try:\n\n{code}\n    public void run() {\n      while (running) {\n        try {\n          Thread.sleep(updateInterval);\n          synchronized (taskTrackerManager) {\n            synchronized (FairScheduler.this) {\n              update();\n              dumpIfNecessary();\n              preemptTasksIfNecessary();\n            }\n          }\n        } catch (Exception e) {\n          LOG.error(\"Exception in fair scheduler UpdateThread\", e);\n        }\n      }\n    }\n{code}\n\nAnother possible fix is to call FairScheduler.update() in FairScheduler.assignTasks() to re-calculate the fairs share.\n\nAny comments?\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"327893","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"FairScheduler preeempts tasks from the pool whose fair share is below the mininum quota ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=angushe","name":"angushe","key":"angushe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus He","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=angushe","name":"angushe","key":"angushe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Angus He","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-5241/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1kijr:"}}
