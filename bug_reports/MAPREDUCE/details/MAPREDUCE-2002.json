(Rather than passing in an empty Configuration object, as is being done now.)\n\n\nLong description:\n\nThe MRUnit driver classes (i.e., MapDriver, ReduceDriver, and MapReduceDriver) ought to be enhanced to contain methods for setting a Configuration object to be used by the mapper/reducer being tested - i.e., setConfiguration() and withConfiguration().\n\nThe only way to effectively pass parameters into a mapper or reducer is by setting properties on a configuration object, which the mapper/reducer can then retrieve in their \"setup\" step, and use to customize its operation.  As a result, specific mappers/reducers may require the presence of specific configuration properties/parameters in order to function correctly (or at all).  (I am currently coding such a reducer right now.)\n\nTesting such a mapper/reducer thus requires that the unit testing framework used provide the ability to pass in user-supplied Configuration objects to them so that they can be tested with appropriate parameter values.  However, MRUnit currently does not provide this ability.  (All mappers/reducers are always passed an empty configuration object.)  And there is not even currently any (easy) way for the end-user to fix this problem by creating a simple sub-class that supplies this functionality, as such subclasses would require a substantial reimplementation/override of several MRUnit framework classes.\n\nI believe this something that is not too difficult to fix in the MRUnit framework code, however, and would greatly help the usability of MRUnit.\n\n\nAlthough I don't have time to code this enhancement right now, if needed/preferred I could squeeze out some time to code up a patch for this.  If that's needed, please let me know.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"111842","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"MRUnit driver classes should provide ability to set a configuration object to be passed into the mapper/reducer","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=darose","name":"darose","key":"darose","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Rosenstrauch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=darose","name":"darose","key":"darose","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Rosenstrauch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471249/comment/12897523","id":"12897523","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Does this duplicate MAPREDUCE-1569?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kimballa","name":"kimballa","key":"kimballa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Aaron Kimball","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-08-12T00:15:42.711+0000","updated":"2010-08-12T00:15:42.711+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12471249/comment/12897547","id":"12897547","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=darose","name":"darose","key":"darose","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Rosenstrauch","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Yes, it does look like a dupe.
