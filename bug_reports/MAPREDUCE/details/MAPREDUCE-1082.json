It has some problems. The most important one is that for converting {{QueueInfo}} obects to {{JobQueueInfo}} objects, this patch creates a new {{JobQueueInfo}} objects everytime. This causes other tests like {{TestQueueMangerRefresh}} to fail. This has also proved to be problematic in the past too while working with MAPREDUCE-893.\n\nGoing back and summarizing the main cause for this bug, the NPE occurs while trying to serialize a hierarchy of {{JobQueueInfo}} objects. {{JobQueueInfo}} extends {{QueueInfo}} and so serialization code is accordingly inherited. So, the problem is as follows:\n\nHierarchy before serialization:\n{code}\nJobQueueInfo-one\n   |-- JobQueueInfo-child-one\n   `-- JobQueueInfo-child-two\n{code}\n\nDeserialized hierarchy:\n{code}\nJobQueueInfo-one\n   |-- QueueInfo-child-one\n   `-- QueueInfo-child-two\n{code}\n\nThis poses problem while traversing the deserializing hierarchy.\n\nTwo solutions possible:\n - From the deserialized hierarchy, construct a proper hierarchy of {{JobQueueInfo}}s and use this from then on.\n - Or solve the central probem which is about fixing the inconsistent handling of relation {{JobQueueInfo}} with {{QueueInfo}} objects.\n\nGiven that the central problem has already resulted in some issues before too, I propose that once and for all we fix the problems with {{JobQueueInfo}} <-> {{QueueInfo}} inter-conversion as part of this JIRA issue.

In all the API, it is QueueInfo objects that are transferred over IPC, and I think it should remain that way.\n- I think the test case needs to be an end-to-end test by definition, as the fix is both in JobQueueInfo as well as in the JobTracker, where when we translate JobQueueInfos to QueueInfos, we fix the translation by walking the entire hierarchy. I would suggest a test that brings up a MiniMRCluster with hierarchical queues, submits a job to one of the queues and calls Cluster.getRootQueues and verifies the returned QueueInfo information. We might need a package private JobTracker.setQueueManager to enable setting up hierarchical queues with a miniMRCluster.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-11-30T09:01:47.816+0000","updated":"2009-11-30T09:01:47.816+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437579/comment/12784105","id":"12784105","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaitk","name":"chaitk","key":"chaitk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"V.V.Chaitanya Krishna","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Uploading patch with the above ideas implemented.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chaitk","name":"chaitk","key":"chaitk","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"V.V.Chaitanya Krishna","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-01T07:53:52.431+0000","updated":"2009-12-01T07:53:52.431+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437579/comment/12785899","id":"12785899","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Looking close.
