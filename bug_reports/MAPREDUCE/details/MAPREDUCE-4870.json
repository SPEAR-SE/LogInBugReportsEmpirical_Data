The attached patch changes the test to poll for any of the terminal states: {{RMAppState.FINISHED}}, {{RMAppState.FAILED}}, or {{RMAppState.KILLED}}.  Those are all of the terminal states, right?  After the loop, I added an assertion that it was {{RMAppState.FINISHED}}.  For extra safety, I also aborted the polling loop after a maximum of 60 seconds.\n\nThe test still fails on Windows on the new assertion.
