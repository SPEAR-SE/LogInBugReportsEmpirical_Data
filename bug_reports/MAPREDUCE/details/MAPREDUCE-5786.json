We need to have \"mapreduce.shuffle.enable.keep.alive\" to enable keep-alive in the ShuffleHandler and \"mapreduce.shuffle.enable.keep.alive.timeout\" to determine the time-out value for the persistent connection.  E.g, \"Keep-Alive: timeout=60\" header specifies that the connection will be kept alive for 60 seconds after which the connection will be closed.
