For context of other reviewers, the root cause is tasks in-flight can inadvertently recreate the job output directory when creating their temporary output directory because it's a subdirectory of the output directory and parent directories are created by default.\n\nNote that I'm not a fan of the let's-wait-for-all-tasks approach, as we had all sorts of problems with hung AMs stuck in the KILL_WAIT state awaiting task completions that would never come.  I'd much rather just have the AM die quickly with the correct final status and have the tasks tear themselves down as a result.  Therefore I'd rather have the tasks properly *not* create the output directory when creating their temporary output directory and simply fail (as they should) when the output directory is missing.\n\nAs I understand it, there's an issue with the HDFS interface since there's apparently no way to create a directory without also implicitly creating the parent directories via FileSystem.  createNonRecursive would work, but it's deprecated.  We could switch to FileContext, but that could be just as risky of a change due to the scope and potential for extra namenode connections or RPC load.  So we might end up having to do the wait-for-all-tasks-when-failing method proposed here.  If that happens, a few comments on the patch:\n\n* the FAIL_ABORT state was originally intended to await the response of the committer thread after it processes the abortJob call, and it's now being reused for a FAIL_WAIT state.  This is probably possible, but we need to make sure we don't leave the FAIL_ABORT state until the committer thread has signaled the completion of the abortJob processing.  Failure to do so means the RM could kill the AM task while it's mid-abort which is undesirable.  Therefore a JOB_TASK_COMPLETED should never lead us to the FAILED state, or we could do just that.  The only way to get from FAIL_ABORT to FAILED should be if the committer thread sent JOB_ABORT_COMPLETED.\n* We should not be sending JOB_ABORT_COMPLETED via a timer, or we could skip calling the committer completely to clean up.  That would leave us with the same symptom trying to be fixed, a leftover output directory after a failed job.  We can debate whether a timer is useful or not (it masks bookkeeping problems, for better or worse), but if used it should send a separate event to indicate the code should just stop waiting for more tasks to complete and signal the committer to cleanup.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-18T22:59:07.937+0000","updated":"2013-06-18T22:59:07.937+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652108/comment/13687837","id":"13687837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patch addressing Jason's comments","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-19T10:30:12.957+0000","updated":"2013-06-19T10:30:12.957+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652108/comment/13687856","id":"13687856","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks a lot for your detailed review Jason. Thanks also for summarizing all the problems.\n\nDaryn and Kihwal also pointed out to me that another problem with using non-recursive create is that the existing behavior of some OutputCommitters may be to depend on the recursive create in setupTask. I agree with you, that we should use non-recursive create but can we please pursue that in another JIRA since it changes pre-existing behavior?\n\nThis patch simply provides a best-effort guarantee that abortJob will be called after all the tasks are finished/killed. I think that is a reasonable expectation on the part of our users who choose to write their own OutputCommitters. In the case that the timeout expires, we may still be left with stale files if some tasks are still alive and create the directory, but I feel that is a bullet we have to bite.\n\nI've incorporated all your comments.

It would mirror the KILL_ABORT / KILL_WAIT states that exist in the job kill path.\n\nSpeaking of the KILL_WAIT state, if we're using a timeout for FAIL_WAIT it should be applied to KILL_WAIT as well.

The event could be backed up in the event queue and delivered *after* we leave the state, so it needs to be at least ignored in any downstream states from FAIL_WAIT.\n\nThe findbugs warning also seems legit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-06-19T20:51:34.467+0000","updated":"2013-06-19T20:51:34.467+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652108/comment/13690087","id":"13690087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patch for trunk","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-06-21T07:25:02.415+0000","updated":"2013-06-21T07:25:02.415+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652108/comment/13690090","id":"13690090","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Jason!

Are we pushing the JOB_WAIT_TIMEOUT to another JIRA?  I didn't see that addressed.  A few more comments:\n\n* Why does FAIL_WAIT ignore the JOB_COMMIT_COMPLETED/JOB_COMMIT_FAILED events?  I don't see how those events could arrive in this state, as it would require the committer to have been invoked sometime before entering this state.  Maybe I'm missing a scenario where that does occur?  KILL_WAIT doesn't do this, for example, so it seems we should either not need this in FAIL_WAIT or KILL_WAIT also needs it.\n* In the testcase, it's using AsyncDispatcher yet checking immediately after handling an event that the committer has not been invoked.  This is inherently racy due to the nature of AsyncDispatcher.  Couple of options to fix it:\n** Use InlineDispatcher or DrainDispatcher and call drain() (the latter is still technically a bit racy but the window is much smaller)\n** Rather than checking the committer directly, spy/mock the event handler and verify after the event was handled that we didn't try to dispatch a committer event\n* Nit: rather than explicitly waiting a hardcoded duration in the test case, we might be able to use verify with a timeout so we don't have to wait the full duration under normal test conditions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-07-02T22:58:55.677+0000","updated":"2013-07-02T22:58:55.677+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652108/comment/13708765","id":"13708765","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hi Jason!\nThanks for your review.
