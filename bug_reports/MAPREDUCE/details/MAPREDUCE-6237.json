This is not a good idea. We should be creating separate connection. If performance is a concern, then we should be using connection pooling instead.\n\nI looked at DBOutputFormat.getRecordReader. It actually creates a new Connection object for each DBRecordReader. So can we just change DBInputFormat to create new Connection every time? The connection reuse code was added as part of connection leak bug in MAPREDUCE-1443. Any reason for caching the connection?\n\nWe observed this issue in a customer setup where they were reading data from MySQL using Pig. As per customer, the query is returning two records which causes Pig to create two instances of DBRecordReader. These two instances are sharing the database connection instance. The first DBRecordReader runs to extract the first record from MySQL just fine, but then closes the shared connection instance. When the second DBRecordReader runs, it tries to execute a query to retrieve the second record on the closed shared connection instance, which fail. If we set\nmapred.map.tasks to 1, the query will be successful.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/version/12329004","id":"12329004","description":"2.6.1

But I would like to point out my understanding of how this API is meant to be used. If you still feel that I should bring back the old behavior, I will do so.\n\n- getConnection is a public method, so anyone can access it. I don't know why it was done this way because it breaks encapsulation. Except for the subclasses, no one else should care about accessing the Connection object. In fact, subclasses can already access it without this method because its a protected variable.\n\n- But to avoid breaking subclasses that already use this API to access the connection, we need to keep it. So I updated the patch.\n\n- The connection object is created inside setConf method. So it is guaranteed to be not null unless the caller explicitly called the close method and then tried to access the connection again. This is an improper usage of the API. I doubt if anyone would be using it that way. But if a subclass is doing this, then it is better to fix that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkannan82","name":"rkannan82","key":"rkannan82","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rkannan82&avatarId=21895","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rkannan82&avatarId=21895","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rkannan82&avatarId=21895","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rkannan82&avatarId=21895"},"displayName":"Kannan Rajah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-04T18:52:21.556+0000","updated":"2015-02-04T18:52:21.556+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12771464/comment/14306716","id":"14306716","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ozawa","name":"ozawa","key":"ozawa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ozawa&avatarId=21740"},"displayName":"Tsuyoshi Ozawa","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thank you for clarification.
