(total scheduled reducers = 1024)\n- Then, in {{scheduleReduces}}, it ramps up all reducers (total = 1024).\n\nAs a result, we can see total #requested-containers increased 1024 for every MRAM-RM heartbeat (1 sec per heartbeat). The AM is hanging for 18+ hours, so we get 18 * 3600 * 1024 ~ 66M+ requested containers in RM side.\n\nAnd this bug also triggered YARN-4844, which makes RM stop scheduling anything.\n\nThanks to [~sidharta-s] for helping with analysis.

The calculations in this method are such that this is done too aggressively with default configurations.\nConfiguration of yarn.app.mapreduce.am.job.reduce.rampup.limit has the default value of 0.5. And if headroom is limited(like in MAPREDUCE-6513 scenario) i.e. barely enough to launch one mapper/reducer, because of this config value, it  thinks that there is sufficient room to launch one more mapper and therefore there is no need to ramp down and reducers are ramped up.  However, if this continues forever then this does not seem correct.\nShould we really be ramping up if we have hanging map requests irrespective of configuration value of reduce rampup limit ?\nWe can probably use configuration introduced in MAPREDUCE-6302 to determine if maps are hanging(i.e. maps are stuck in scheduled state) and do not ramp up reduces if maps are hanging for a while. The config value of how long to wait however would depend on the kind of job being run though.\n\nWe also have MAPREDUCE-6541 as well which adjusts headroom received from RM to find out if we have enough resources for a map task to run.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=varun_saxena","name":"varun_saxena","key":"varun_saxena","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Varun Saxena","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2016-05-06T13:27:10.009+0000","updated":"2016-05-06T13:27:10.009+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12965142/comment/15274118","id":"15274118","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Sorry for arriving late to the discussion.\n\nbq. Should we really be ramping up if we have hanging map requests irrespective of configuration value of reduce rampup limit ?\n\nRamping up reducers when maps are hanging does sound a bit dubious, but it may make sense in some scenarios.  Consider a case where a job issues tons of maps, far more than the queue can handle.  Some of those maps are going to appear to be hanging for a very long time because they have to run in multiple waves.  The whole point of ramping up reducers before the maps are complete is to try to reduce job latency (at the expense of overall cluster throughput) by pipelining the shuffle of the completed tasks with the remaining map tasks.  If the job has tons of data to shuffle for each map then it may make sense to sacrifice some of the map resources to get the reducers running early so they can start chewing on the horde of completed map output.  It all depends upon the map durations, the shuffle burden, etc.  It is definitely safer from a correctness point of view to avoid ramping up reducers if there are any hanging maps at all, but I believe there could be some jobs whose latency could increase as a result of that change.\n\nI'm guessing the root cause of the issue is an incorrect headroom report, e.g.: there's technically enough free space in the headroom but it's fragmented across nodes in such a way that no single map can fit on any node.  The unconditional preemption logic from MAPREDUCE-6302 was supposed to address this, but it looks like the container allocator can quickly \"forget\" this decision and re-schedule the reducers that were shot.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason

IMO, headroom responded from scheduler is not trustable. It missed many constraints, for example, blacklist, hard locality, etc. And it gonna be expensive to calculate everything inside scheduler.
