Alejandro, I know you have been looking at and thinking about the classpath issue with YARN/MR, and how we should package things a lot already. MAPREDUCE-3745, HADOOP-7935, and MAPREDUCE-4421 do we need another JIRA explicitly for tools?  How do we handle the case of a tool having a map/reduce dependency now that the MR code is going to be separated out so that we can use a different version of MR?  Does that mean that they have to provide their own tools with a MR dependency and a config to point to them?  It just seems like a change like this needs a full design.
