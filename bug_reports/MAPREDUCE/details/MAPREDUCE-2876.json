I would propose that we modify LivnessMonitor to store expiry in a priority queue instead of a map. Then it can sleep just the amount of time needed before the next one expires. It is fairly simple and I have done this type of thing in the past. Then there is very little error from the expire interval, and we don't have to worry about a monitor interval at all.\n\npriority queue - This was exactly the same thing I was thinking the first time when I wrote. The reason I chose Map is as follows - We receive pings from AM/NM/Tasks etc very frequently in the order of 1-3 seconds. The no of insertions in the priority queue would be huge. The *cumulative* cost of multiple insertions in priority queue would be more than iterating over the whole list every few seconds. make sense ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sharadag","name":"sharadag","key":"sharadag","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sharad Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-08-30T11:18:28.049+0000","updated":"2011-08-30T11:18:28.049+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520015/comment/13094562","id":"13094562","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I am fine with the polling like I said before.  The question I was trying to answer was what is the ramifications of not having a polling interval, but just having an expiry interval, and setting the polling interval off of the expiry interval.  It means the real expiry interval is any time between expiryInterval and expiryInterval + pollingInterval.  If that is never a problem then polling is fine. \n\nI can see your reasoning behind the change.  When there are N objects being tracked then polling would be\n\n{code}\n O((pollingFrequency * N) + (modificationFrequency * N))\n{code}\n\nBut Priority Queue would be\n\n{code}\nO(modificationFrequency * N * log(N) + expiryFrequency)\n{code}\n\nSo if the modificationFrequency is very large then polling definitely wins in complexity, but I am curious did you run any benchmarks to see what kind of an extra load would be placed on the system with a priority queue (Just curious what it might be)?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-08-31T14:20:25.951+0000","updated":"2011-08-31T14:20:25.951+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12520015/comment/13095102","id":"13095102","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sharadag","name":"sharadag","key":"sharadag","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sharad Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@Robert As you have mentioned, the modificationFrequency and N is quite high in most of our usecases.
