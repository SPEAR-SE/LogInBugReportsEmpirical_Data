Should I be able to use a hadoop cluster in this fashion or is this not supported (if not, supported, I guess close this bug as invalid). If it is not supported, it reduces the usability of hadoop for a class of users like myself (but maybe thats a small class).\n2. If I should be able to use the cluster like this, should <mapred.system.dir>/<job id>/jobToken need to be created if security is disabled? If no, then I guess is the bug that needs to be fixed. If yes, then the jobtracker needs to be modified to allow everyone to create dirs in mapred.system.dir (or the method of creation of the jobToken file needs to be changed).\n\nApologies if this was operator error but I didn't get much feedback on the mailing lists so not sure where/how else to raise this.\n\n\nChanged introduced in MAPREDUCE-2219","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"60220","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Jobtracker sets permissions on mapred.system.dir to 700 preventing non-superusers from submitting jobs to multi-user cluster","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=smulcahy","name":"smulcahy","key":"smulcahy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stephen mulcahy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Dublin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=smulcahy","name":"smulcahy","key":"smulcahy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stephen mulcahy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Dublin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Debian 6.0 x64_64\njava version \"1.6.0_26\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_26-b03)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 20.1-b02, mixed mode)","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532617/comment/13156860","id":"13156860","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"MAPREDUCE-2219 wasn't committed to 0.20.205, so that's not the cause of this... or did you mean it might be a solution?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-11-24T18:34:00.360+0000","updated":"2011-11-24T18:34:00.360+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12532617/comment/13157087","id":"13157087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=smulcahy","name":"smulcahy","key":"smulcahy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"stephen mulcahy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Dublin"},"body":"Hi, sorry, I thought MAPREDUCE-2219 had introduced the permissions check on mapred.system.dir (resetting it to 700 on jobtracker startup) but I didn't read it closely enough.
