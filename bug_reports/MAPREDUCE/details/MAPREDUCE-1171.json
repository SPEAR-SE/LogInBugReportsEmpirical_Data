Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This is caused by a behavioral change in hadoop 0.20.1. In 0.18.3, the fetch-retry behavior used to be that each map output fetch will retry N (by default 6) times. Now in 0.20.1, not each map output fetch will have N retries. For a particular map output, only the first fetch attempt will have N retries. If the first N retry fails, subsequent fetch attempt, even it is from a different node, will only have 2 retries before failure. Thus, it greatly increased the chance of having \"too many fetch failures\".\n\nThe line of code is in src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/ReduceTask.java, line 2090 to line 2104.\n\nI would argue that if the subsequent map output fetch attempt is from the mapper node, it should only have 2 retries. However, if the map output is from a different mapper node (basically a different map attempt), it should still have N retries.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=visualage","name":"visualage","key":"visualage","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Qi Liu","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-10-30T04:24:38.057+0000","updated":"2009-10-30T04:24:38.057+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439477/comment/12772300","id":"12772300","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The algorithm in hadoop-0.20 that determines when to mark a map task as having too many fetch failures seems to have big problems with jobs that have a few out-layers in map task runtimes.\n\nThe job mentioned in the description has a couple of map tasks requiring about 3 hours of runtime (1hr application execution time and 2hrs merge phase), with the overall average map runtime much smaller.\nThe consequence is that all reduces just wait for these few map tasks to finish, and these maps get declared as 'failed' very quickly because of many socket timeout exceptions on the reduce side although there is nothing wrong with the map tasks.\n\nThe first attempt to run the job failed after 28hrs (we allow for up to 10 map task failures), with about only 200 reduces successfully fetching map output every time the long running map tasks completed; these map tasks got declared as failed within less than 1 minute after completion.\n\nWe deployed an emergency fetch in the ReduceTask, commenting out the portion where a single read error results in a report:\n{noformat}\n  \n              if (//cr.getError().equals(CopyOutputErrorType.READ_ERROR) ||\n                 ((noFailedFetches >= fetchRetriesPerMap)\n                  && ((noFailedFetches - fetchRetriesPerMap) % 2) == 0)) {\n                synchronized (ReduceTask.this) {\n                  taskStatus.addFetchFailedMap(mapTaskId);\n{noformat}\nand it helped somewhat.\nThe job finished after 6 re-executions of the long running map tasks (fortunately, we allow a high number of map task failures), but still took 18hrs instead of optimally less than 4 hrs. About 600 reduces got map output successfully before the map tasks got declared as failed, always because of 5+ socket timeout exceptions (one advantage of hadoop-0.20 to retry a fetch within a few seconds was counter-productive here).\n\nWith hadoop-0.18.3 this job  needed less than 9 hrs (not optimal but we could live with it).\n\nTake away:\nCurrent algorithm is not general enough to cover all corner cases, in particular jobs with a handful of much longer running map tasks.\nIt should be improved (there should be an allowance for socket timeout exceptions when a high number of reduces fetch output from a single map task in parallel) or there should be a configuration option to allow to override the threshold on a per job basis.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ckunz","name":"ckunz","key":"ckunz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christian Kunz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-01T03:31:24.266+0000","updated":"2009-11-01T03:31:24.266+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439477/comment/12772417","id":"12772417","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"HADOOP-3327 went into branch 0.21","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-11-02T04:48:45.861+0000","updated":"2009-11-02T04:48:45.861+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439477/comment/12772424","id":"12772424","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Christian, are you using Yahoo! distribution for 0.20? \n\nIn branch 0.21, MAPREDUCE-353 makes connect and read timeout configurable for a job.
