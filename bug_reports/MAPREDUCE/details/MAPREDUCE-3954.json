Because when I read that I thought I would set the env var to 1000MB.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-03-02T20:54:24.395+0000","updated":"2012-03-02T20:54:24.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12544808/comment/13221699","id":"13221699","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Looks good to me too, besides comments from Thomas.\n\n+1 for comments (1) and (3) above.
