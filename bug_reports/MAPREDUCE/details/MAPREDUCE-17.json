The problem with this is that the job client could treat this operation as successful, and lead to misleading results.\n- throw an exception to indicate the operation is invalid.\n- make setJobPriority return a boolean indicating Success/Failure. Unfortunately, would this be a backwards incompatible change ?\n\nAlso, we need to make the web UI handle this.\n\nProbably throwing an exception is the most feasible, yet correct solution.
