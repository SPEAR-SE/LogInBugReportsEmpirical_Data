I guess it could be a test timing out right as a setPermissions is done, interrupting in the middle... but seems pretty unlikely, don't you think?\n\nYes.  I'm guessing it's more subtle than that and lies within the core MR code or the JVM.  The fact that I see it semi-frequently on NFS (that is, more frequent than Hudson or production) suggests either timing (NFS is slow), perhaps via an erroneous assumption of synchronous behavior, or else an erroneous assumption of an infallible system call.  It could be other things as well, of course, but those seem to me like the most probable candidates.\n\nbq. I agree we could work around it for the tests, but I'm nervous whether we will see this issue crop up in production. Have you guys at Yahoo seen this on any clusters running secure YDH?\n\nTo clarify, I was suggesting working around it in the MR code itself, not realizing that the Hudson backtrace wasn't using MR code at all.  (Well, apparently.)  So I'm not sure where that leaves us, other than trying to fix the actual set-permissions problem.  Seems like no one's basic deleteRecursive() implementation includes an option to attempt a chmod() before failing on bad permissions?\n\nAnyway, yes, I _think_ we've seen it in production with 0.20S or later, but it wasn't while I was on call, so I might be remembering a different issue with similar symptoms.
