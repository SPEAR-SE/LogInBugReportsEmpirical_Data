The old conf files remain in the history folder and fail to be moved to \"done\" subdirectory\nThere is no need to move the conf file to the done folder. In this case the job is run as a new job and hence a new conf file is created for this job. The jobhistory file gets deleted as it is required for recovery (checkpoint process). The conf file is doesnt play any role in the recovery process. Here is what is happening \n# jobtracker starts with id _id1_\n# job job1 is submitted and creates history file hostname_id1_job1_user_jobname and conf file as hostname_id1_job1_conf.xml\n# jobtracker restart with id _id2_\n# jobtracker tries to recover the job. There are 2 possibilities here :\n ## If the job-initialization thread inits the job before the recovery-manager picks up the job for recovery then the new filename would be  hostname_id1_job1_user_jobname.recover and the conf file would be  hostname_id1_job1_conf.xml. In such a case there wont be any garbage left in the history folder.\n ## If the recovery-manager picks up the job first before the init-thread then it will assume that there is nothing to recover and will delete hostname_id1_job1_user_jobname (leaving  hostname_id1_job1_conf.xml). When the job inits, it will take a new filename i.e  hostname_id2_job1_user_jobname and  hostname_id2_job1_conf.xml. Only in this case the conf file ( hostname_id1_job1_conf.xml) is left behind in the history folder. \n\nAFAIK this is a timing issue. I think a proper fix for all this corner cases is MAPREDUCE-11.
