I spent some time investigating this.\n\nDistcp has two modes of execution. 1 from the cmdline and the other is programmatically.\n\nThe patch will work correctly for programmatical usage if settings from mapred-site.xml have already been applied to the  input  *Configuration* parameter as the properties set by distcp-default.xml will not be overridden again since mapred-site (and also mapred-default/yarn-default/yarn-site) is loaded as a *default resource* before job submission.\n\nFor command line usage  Distcp adds distcp-default.xml as a *resource* (and not as a default resource) which would take higher precedence than default/site files mentioned before as they are loaded as *default resources* . Even if Distcp adds distcp-default.xml as a default resource, the code will be brittle and prone to which default resources are loaded first since mapred-site/mapred-default/yarn-site/yarn-default are all loaded in static blocks in classes org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.{Job, Cluster} \n\nSince distcp is just like any other MR job I think the best way would be to get rid of un-needed conf from distcp-default.xml.\nBelow are the properties mentioned in distcp-default.xml\n{noformat}\ndistcp.dynamic.strategy.impl\ndistcp.static.strategy.impl\nmapred.job.map.memory.mb\nmapred.job.reduce.memory.mb\nmapred.reducer.new-api\nmapreduce.reduce.class\n{noformat}\n\nSeems like getting rid of {noformat}mapred.job.{map|reduce}.memory.mb{noformat} is all we need as the rest are required by distcp.\nAny other configuration the user wants to specify in distcp can very well be specified as jvm opts for cmd line usage and as simple parameters to Configuration option for programmatical usage.\n\nPlease update with your thoughts/concerns.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdsr","name":"rdsr","key":"rdsr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ratandeep Ratti","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2015-02-24T08:35:38.770+0000","updated":"2015-02-24T08:35:38.770+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681160/comment/14334708","id":"14334708","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

A \"reasonable default\" in code bases without MAPREDUCE-5785 and without making the situation worse (e.g., Philip's concerns, the proposed \"fix\" in HADOOP-14176, us making assumptions about what JVM is in use, etc) would need to be provided.  \n\ndistcp, years ago, probably should have provided alternate ways to set it's memory, etc, and then changed these params based upon either the provided values or use it's own internal defaults when they weren't overriden. This \"hides\" the fact that it's \"just\" a fancy MR job while still providing the flexibility needed for advanced users.  For branch-2, that's really the only way I see out of this mess.  But that ship has mostly sailed, with Hadoop 2.x on it's deathbed and the problem mostly solved in 3.x by this patch+MAPREDUCE-5785.
