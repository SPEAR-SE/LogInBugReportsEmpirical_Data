cache files) to call check_path_for_relative_components.\n- Modified the way in which error code was tracked and handled in the methods so I could return a relevant error code when relative components are found.\n- Added tests for all the conditions. For testing initialization of job, task and distributed cache, the approach followed is that we create the original directories and some dummy directories. Then we launch the task controller exe with some of the arguments tweaked to have relative components. We verify the call fails with an ExitCodeException with the right error code. For user and log initialization, I write a taskcontroller.cfg with relative paths in mapred local directories and hadoop.log.dir and verify the same failures. The latter approach is needed because passing relative paths in the command line arguments will not trigger the code path we want to exercise in these two cases.\n\nAll task-controller tests are passing with this patch, as also test-patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-03-15T14:00:06.611+0000","updated":"2010-03-15T14:00:06.611+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12446779/comment/12846014","id":"12846014","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I realized the patch is not complete.
