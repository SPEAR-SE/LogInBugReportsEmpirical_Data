The graph is of a map task which sorts 1GB of data with default settings (100mb io sort mb) and 100 reducers. This causes a lot of merges. You can see that without the patch, there are many allocations which start halfway through (when the merge phase starts) causing the heap to have to grow. With the patch, there is only a gentle slope upwards at that point (the gentle slope is caused by allocations of the various input readers)\n\nThe wall time performance doesn't seem to be significantly changed, at least for my micro-benchmark, since there's enough heap to easily grow and absorb the useless allocations. That said, it might have more meaningful improvements on a more heap-constrained workload or larger heap.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-04-04T18:04:06.759+0000","updated":"2014-04-04T18:04:06.759+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12706674/comment/13960213","id":"13960213","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
