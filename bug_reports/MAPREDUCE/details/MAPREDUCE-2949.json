Couple of comments:\n\nbq. I think LocalizerTracker should be under the ResourceLocalizationService as its not generic enough, to be made a seperate service.I feel that moving the tasks to the service startup may be a good thing.\nWhat I meant was that LocalizerTracker can be under ResourceLocalizationService but still extends {{AbstractService}} and thus implement the life-cycle properly, that's been the convention and discipline we've been adhering to in YARN :)\n\nGranted the localizerTracker is going away because of NM's shutdown hook, one thing that is not clear is how the {{cacheCleanup}} executor-service is going away during JVM shutdown in your manual verification after the patch. May be it is the timing and NM will probably shut down cleanly if there are no active thread in the pool? I'd think that we should do an explicit shutdown on the executor-service.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-12T12:42:22.002+0000","updated":"2011-09-12T12:42:22.002+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522238/comment/13104529","id":"13104529","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviteja","name":"raviteja","key":"raviteja","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Teja Ch N V","active":true,"timeZone":"Indian/Maldives"},"body":"Hi Vinod, Thanks for correcting me, I have got it wrong the first time.\n\nSorry for the delay,Attached the patch with the review comments fixed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviteja","name":"raviteja","key":"raviteja","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Teja Ch N V","active":true,"timeZone":"Indian/Maldives"},"created":"2011-09-14T14:37:22.813+0000","updated":"2011-09-14T14:37:22.813+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522238/comment/13104540","id":"13104540","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.
