On one hand I can see being consistent with updateStatus() and throwing when we get a null.  On the other hand we know a null status means the job is either not know to the RM (therefore probably not running) or we were redirected to the history server because the RM thinks the job's not running and the history server doesn't know about the job (probably because it crashed badly or was killed by YARN and didn't copy the job history).

Jobcilent is redirected to historyserver to get job status.\n\nAnd job status is null means it is getting null status from HistoryServer only.

Looks better, but I noticed something I should have before.  After sending the kill directive via the MR client the code then loops as long as the job state isn't KILLED.  However if the job is finishing just as we send the kill then the job may finish in a non-killed state.  I think the client would then loop until the full timeout before returning.  Instead of checking for not KILLED we should be checking for a non-terminal state instead (e.g. != KILLED, SUCCEEDED, or FAILED).  We can make an EnumSet of the terminal job states and check if the status is not in that set.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-15T18:24:16.090+0000","updated":"2014-10-15T18:24:16.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12670744/comment/14173361","id":"14173361","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rohithsharma","name":"rohithsharma","key":"rohithsharma","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rohith Sharma K S","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"body":"bq. the client would then loop until the full timeout before returning.\nI see.
