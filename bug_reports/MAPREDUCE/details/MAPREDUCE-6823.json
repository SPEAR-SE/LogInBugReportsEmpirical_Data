The normal committer relies on directory rename() being atomic for this; for S3 we don't have that luxury.\n\nTo support a custom committer, we need to be able to tell FileOutputFormat (and implicitly, all subclasses which don't have their own custom committer), to use our new {{S3AOutputCommitter}}.\n\nI propose: \n\n# {{FileOutputFormat}} takes a factory to create committers.\n# The factory to take a URI and {{TaskAttemptContext}} and return a committer\n# the default implementation always returns a {{FileOutputCommitter}}\n# A configuration option allows a new factory to be

It adds a new factory for FileOutputFormatter to use when creating committers; the default one returns {{FileOutputCommitter}} instances as normal; a special S3a one in {{hadoop-aws}} to handle S3a specific operations.\n\nNow, the other way to do this (given the need to keep the s3a code in the s3a module) would be to allow a notion of a new algorithm, one which relayed to an implementation of an interface. That would hand a problem not addressed here: how to address subclasses of {{FileOutputFormat}} with custom subclasses of {{FileOutputCommitter}}, and make it easier to add committers for other non-FS-destinations, namely the other object stores. \n\nHowever, it would be a more significant change to {{FileOutputCommitter}}; I could go that way, but it'd need support before I started.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stevel%40apache.org","name":"stevel@apache.org","key":"stevel@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=stevel%40apache.org&avatarId=16513"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2016-12-16T19:41:24.059+0000","updated":"2016-12-16T19:41:24.059+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13028140/comment/15755515","id":"15755515","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"| (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |\n\\\\\n\\\\\n|| Vote || Subsystem || Runtime || Comment ||\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} reexec {color} | {color:blue} 17m 16s {color} | {color:blue} Docker mode activated. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} @author {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch does not contain any @author tags. {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} test4tests {color} | {color:green} 0m 0s {color} | {color:green} The patch appears to include 6 new or modified test files. {color} |\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} mvndep {color} | {color:blue} 1m 45s {color} | {color:blue} Maven dependency ordering for branch {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 7m 39s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 7m 39s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} checkstyle {color} | {color:green} 1m 30s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 0m 57s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 30s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} findbugs {color} | {color:green} 1m 16s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} javadoc {color} | {color:green} 0m 36s {color} | {color:green} HADOOP-13345 passed {color} |\n| {color:blue}0{color} | {color:blue} mvndep {color} | {color:blue} 0m 15s {color} | {color:blue} Maven dependency ordering for patch {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvninstall {color} | {color:green} 0m 43s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} compile {color} | {color:green} 7m 17s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} javac {color} | {color:red} 7m 17s {color} | {color:red} root generated 2 new + 716 unchanged - 0 fixed = 718 total (was 716) {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} checkstyle {color} | {color:red} 1m 35s {color} | {color:red} root: The patch generated 48 new + 66 unchanged - 1 fixed = 114 total (was 67) {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvnsite {color} | {color:green} 1m 4s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:green}+1{color} | {color:green} mvneclipse {color} | {color:green} 0m 34s {color} | {color:green} the patch passed {color} |\n| {color:red}-1{color} | {color:red} whitespace {color} | {color:red} 0m 0s {color} | {color:red} The patch has 43 line(s) that end in whitespace.

It adds \r\n\r\n* the notion of a committer factory which is given the job configuration and destinatioon path, and returns the committer to use for this job.\r\n# The ability to declare a committer factory for {{org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.FileOutputFormat}} in the option {{mapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.class}}\r\n# The ability to register the default committer to use for different file formats (searched for if  {{mapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.class}} is unset. This lets you define different committers for s3a, wasb, etc\r\n# the default committer factory for creating, {{FileOutputCommitter}} instances\r\n# Another committer factory for creating a named instance of {{PathOutputCommitter}} (see MAPREDUCE-6956), though the property {{mapreduce.outputcommitter.named.classname}}\r\n# Static methods to make this straightforward to use\r\n# {{FileOutputFormat}} wired up to use this factory mechanism.\r\n# Tests for all this\r\n\r\nAs a result of this, you can now define a committer factory/committer class for file output on an explicit per-job or implicit *per-destination* basis. As these are subclasses of PathOutputCommitter, they don't have to go near the complexity of FileOutputFormat and its existing ls/rename/merge strategy, which is high performance and reliable for \"real\" filesystems, but not for object stores or other destinations.\r\nBecause the factories are used in FileOutputFormat, all file output formats which don't provide their own committer will get the feature too. Those which do provide their own committer (ParquetOutputFormat) don't pick up this new feature. It's left to applications to sort that out by calling the {{PathOutputCommitterFactory}} directly (which I have been doing downstream)\r\n\r\nThe per-dest logic is used in HADOOP-13786 for committer factories, most interesting being the \"DynamicCommitterFactory\" which chooses the actual committer based on the settings of the destination bucket. Thats why the complexity of config -> factory instance -> committer instance is important: it offloads the more complex decision making to the factories. The per-fs-schema logic allows us to declare different factories for different filesystems, and the factories making the final call\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nmapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.scheme.s3a  = org.apache.hadoop.fs.s3a.commit.DynamicCommitterFactory\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nAt the same time, jobs can override this with their own decisions, especially with a simple factory which just instantiates a committer class from the propery mapreduce.outputcommitter.named.classname. This gives the MRv2 output formats the same feature that MRv1 has long had: the ability to declare a new output committer for file outputs\r\n\r\n{code}\r\nmapreduce.outputcommitter.factory.class = org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.output.NamedCommitterFactory\r\nmapreduce.outputcommitter.named.classname = YOUR-COMMITTER-CLASSNAME\r\n{code}\r\n\r\nThis does not have any impact on normal commit operations, as the default factory creates FileOutputCommitters, as before. It merely offers the ability to change committers & makes it easy to do this for specific filesystems.\r\n\r\nThis has now been tested all the way through Spark; with a change to its parquet commit logic (SPARK-22217) and a special PathOutputCommitter, this feature lets us write data direct to S3 through Hadoop MR and spark, with ORC, Parquet and other formats. It is also lined up to support any other committers/filesystem committers people write.\r\n\r\nTesting: unit tests here, functional ITests in hadoop-aws, downstream tests elsewhere. \r\n\r\nThings to consider/refine\r\n\r\n* Config option names?\r\n* Best way to document. I've got an empty option in mapred-default.xml, otherwise its all in the javadocs.\r\n* Should the factory code all go into its own package, e.g.
