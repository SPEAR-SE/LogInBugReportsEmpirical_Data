Some places it works, some places it doesnt. \n\nChanging the configuration works on top of changing the hostname, as it doesn't prevent you doing that, but you can try other things like bringing up a new JT on a different port on the same box, new machine, etc. But you do need a way to push out configuration changes to all the task trackers, which classic XML-driven configurations don't have. I can do it, but my code to do that is from subclassing JobConf and using SmartFrog. HADOOP-3582 is a todo list of better configuration options; you'd need a way to push out the change.\n\n1. the extra cost of another lookup of the configuration file is minimal if you are doing retries anyway.\n2. we should set the dns TTL anyway too, but check with Allen what settings he likes before bringing the network down. \n3. configuration file changes are easier to test, so we can see that the file gets checked.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve_l","name":"steve_l","key":"steve_l","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Loughran","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-11-11T11:36:06.877+0000","updated":"2008-11-11T11:36:06.877+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12403009/comment/14079530","id":"14079530","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"Closing this as Won't Fix.\n\nThere are a multitude of ways to get a TT to talk to a new JT, even pre-2.x.
