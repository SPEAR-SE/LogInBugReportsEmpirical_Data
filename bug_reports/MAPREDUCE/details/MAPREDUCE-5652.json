It shouldn't be too much effort to extricate just the ShuffleHandler changes, although there aren't any unit tests for it yet.\n\nAs Alejandro pointed out it also needs some help from the NodeManager to keep it from cleaning up the local directories and removing the shuffle output after restarting.

How do we handle applications that finish while the NM is down?\n\nThe RM is already telling the NM about finished applications, and since it's not creating a new RMNodeImpl when it rejoins it should continue to tell it about subsequent finished applications since the last time the node heartbeated.\n\nThere may be some races in there where the RM thinks the NM processed the heartbeat response but the NM crashed before it completed processing it.  If that's an issue we could fix it by having the NM send the list of apps it thinks are still active when it re-registers, giving the RM an opportunity to correct it on the next heartbeat.  However that's outside of the scope (and project) of this JIRA.  I'll try to address that in YARN-1354 or possibly a separate YARN JIRA.\n\nbq. Code related to initStateStore should ideally go into serviceInit(), primarily to future-proof against us supporting (re)starting stopped services.\n\nserviceStart() indirectly calls initStateStore to open the database, and serviceStop() closes the database.  If we want later to support restarting stopped services then we need to continue to open the database in serviceStart().  Moving the initStateStore call to init rather than start means we will try to use a closed database after the service is restarted, or am I missing something?\n\nbq. Use the constant JOB here?\n\nFixed.  I had to change its visibility to public in order to access it.\n\nbq. ShuffleHandler#recordJobShuffleInfo: addJobToken() should come after attempt to include in the store?\n\nFixed.\n\nbq. ShuffleHandler#close() should probably take care of clearing the static maps. Alternately, we could just make those maps non-static.\n\nI made userRsrc and secretManager regular members rather than static.  Originally I wasn't sure why they were static and didn't want to mess with that too much as part of this JIRA, but it's problematic for testing this.  Apparently they always were static, but I couldn't find any reason for them to be so.  Even in light of multiple ShuffleHandler instances, I don't see why it's something we need (or necessarily even want) to share.  Manually ran the unit tests under hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient to verify there wasn't something fishy going on with the multi-instance ShuffleHandler in mini clusters or something like that.\n\nbq. ShuffleHander#forgetJob() - should we make those two maps non-static?\n\nRemoved forgetJob() now that the members are not static.\n\nbq. Do we need to change hadoop-mapreduce-project/pom.xml, given we already add the dependencies in the shuffle module?\n\nYes, if I remove the dependency from that pom.xml then the leveldb jar doesn't show up in the resulting dist tree under mapreduce/lib/.  Maybe may need the equivalent of YARN-888 for hadoop-mapreduce-project poms to only declare them in the leaf modules and still have them be picked up properly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-11T22:17:27.680+0000","updated":"2014-04-11T22:17:27.680+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681128/comment/13967206","id":"13967206","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Does leveDB's delete method throw exception? JNI has some exception handling and the caller needs to retrieve the exceptions, etc.\n\nNice catch!  I didn't notice there were _two_ DBExceptions flying around in leveldb code.  org.fusesource.leveldbjni.internal.NativeDB.DBException comes from the JNI layer and derives from IOException, and it was the one I was familiar with.  However the wrapper code around the JNI layer catches that exception and rethrows it as org.iq80.leveldb.DBException which is a RuntimeException.  That means we need to wrap all calls that can throw the runtime form and either handle them directly or rethrow as an IOException if it's not appropriate to let the RuntimeException leak out of the method.\n\nUpdated the patch to deal with the runtime DBException when necessary.

I discovered that leveldb's DBIterator isn't consistent with the DB interface and throws raw RuntimeException rather than the derived DBException.  That means whenever we're interacting with the database via the iterator we risk leaking what should be caught as a DBException since it's a raw RuntimeException instead.\n\nThere's a few approaches I considered to work around this:\n\n# Catch RuntimeException rather than DBException for the code blocks that interact with the iterator.\n# Catch RuntimeException and if the cause is NativeDB.DBException then throw an IOException otherwise rethrow the original exception.\n# Wrap DBIterator in a private wrapper class which catches RuntimeException for each method invoked and rethrows it as DBException.\n\nI dismissed the first approach since it's too ham-fisted.  We're likely to catch NPEs and other unrelated RuntimeException and handle them as if they were leveldb errors.  The second approach has the drawback that it knows a bit too much about the DBIterator implementation in that it's digging into the RuntimeException looking for a specific cause.  If the cause were to switch to the iq80 DBException or some other type then we'd leak it instead of converting it.  Therefore I went with the third approach. It's still catching raw RuntimeException like the first approach, but it has the advantage that the try..catch block is localized to just the iterator method being invoked.  Also if leveldb's iterator is ever fixed in the future to throw DBException then we can simply remove the wrapper rather than change all the try..catch code blocks that work with the iterator.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-25T14:09:05.330+0000","updated":"2014-04-25T14:09:05.330+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681128/comment/13981063","id":"13981063","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Just to confirm, protobuf should be backward compatible, e.g., the store state serialized with version 2.4 should be readable by NM/MR compiled with version 2.5.\n\nYes, the protobuf incompatibility between 2.4 and 2.5 is an issue with the interfaces to the protobuf code and not an incompatibility with the data layout of protobuf messages.\n\nbq. On an unrelated note, based on how NM's AuxServices' serviceStart handles error for each AuxService' serviceStart, if one AuxService throws some exception, the rest of AuxServices' serviceStart will be skipped.\n\nI might be reading the code incorrectly, but it looks like AuxServices#serviceStart doesn't try to handle exceptions coming from individual aux services at all.  If one of their startups throws then it will be converted into a RuntimeException (by AbstractService#start) which will bubble up out of AuxServices and likely all the way up such that the NM startup will fail.\n\nAs you pointed out before, a better way to handle aux services would be to run them outside of the NM (maybe even within containers).  It'd also be nice to make them more dynamic, such that application submissions can provide an aux service they require.  They could be started on demand, ref-counted, and stopped accordingly based on usage, which would be a smoother answer to rolling upgrades and sharing multiple versions of the aux services within the cluster.  This is of course a non-trivial amount of work for another JIRA. ;-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-05-02T13:20:50.092+0000","updated":"2014-05-02T13:20:50.092+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12681128/comment/13994444","id":"13994444","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~jlowe] - now that YARN-1987 is committed, mind updating the patch against the latest trunk.
