I'm sure this is not the last JIRA to go into MergeManagerImpl. :-) If we spot something definitely lets open a new one.\n\n* Here's my understanding of how the Merge works. Lets assume all the map outputs are on disk. Lets also say that io.sort.factor is set to X. Since we don't want to do any more merges than are necessary, we try to ensure that in the last *final* merge, there will be X streams to merge. This means that as the reducer starts fetching map outputs, we wait until there are at least 2X-1 map outputs (We don't know how many map outputs we will really get because some maps may not have produced any output). When the number goes over 2X-1, we can be sure that we need an intermediate merge of X streams. This leaves X-1 in onDiskMapOutputs. The X streams are merged into 1. After this merge, together we now have (X-1) + 1 = X streams. When the number of streams > X and < 2X-1, we let the code go to finalMerge, which in itself eventually calls {code:title=Merger.java:645|borderStyle=solid}\nif (numSegments <= factor) {\n....No extra merge needed\n} else {\n....Do a merge of (number of map outputs) - X\n}\n{code} So from my understanding it seems 2X-1 is the correct number. Please let me know if you still think its not.\n\n* Hmmm.. I didn't know you could give a TreeSet a partial ordering and still get sorted output. The latest javadocs don't say anything, but I found a StackOverflow saying it used to be the case in JDK1.2. Do you know if that is still true?\n\n* Unfortunately I hadn't run any performance tests. Hopefully we will get the fix on our clusters soon and if we see incredible improvements in performance, I'll try to remember to report back here. This should probably help on large jobs with a lot of maps and we do have quite a few of those :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-08T23:33:53.162+0000","updated":"2013-03-08T23:33:53.162+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538742/comment/13597848","id":"13597848","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Ravi,\n  You are absolutely right that we want to make sure that in the final merge the number of streams to merge is less than or equal to {{ioSortFactor.}}  I stand corrected on that.  So I should have stated that the change is:\n{code}\n    if (onDiskMapOutputs.size() > ioSortFactor) {\n      onDiskMerger.startMerge(onDiskMapOutputs);\n    }\n{code}\nNote that I changed \">=\" to \">\" from my previous suggestion.  The rationale for starting the merge early(instead of waiting until 2*{{ioSortFactor}} - 1 disk files are created) is to leverage additional overlapped processing.  The last merge will end up with merging less than or equal to {{ioSortFactor}} disk files.\n\nFor example, suppose {{io.sort.factor}} is set to 100 and there are 198 disk files.  With the code in your patch, all 198 files will be merged in the final merge with two sequential merge passes one with 100 and the other with 99.  With my suggestion, the first 100 would have been merged overlapped with the fetches and in-memory merges.  The last merge will merge only 99 files.\n\nBy partial ordering, I did not mean unsorted order.  I meant that duplicates will be retained. Perhaps, I confused you with a mathematical term.  Simply put, in a partially ordered set, all elements\nare related by \"<=\".  When you compare two elements in the set, you want to make sure that the smaller element is collated first.  If one of them is greater than or equal to the other, it is collated second.  The Java {{TreeSet}} implementation will keep the elements in sorted order with this\n{{Comparable}} implementation.  BTW, what you have in the patch will work.  What I suggested has less code with no unnecessary comparisons.  For brevity, you can even code it as:\n{code}\nreturn((this.getCompressedSize() < compPath.getCompressedSize()) ? -1 : 1);\n{code}\n\nIMHO, any performance enhancement should not result in performance regression for any use case.  I just wanted to make sure that your patch does not cause any performance regression in some cases.  If you have some setup to run performance tests, please go ahead.  Otherwise, just ignore my suggestion.\n\n-- Asokan\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-03-09T05:21:32.104+0000","updated":"2013-03-09T05:21:32.104+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538742/comment/13597951","id":"13597951","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi Ravi,\n  I looked at the {{Merger}} class a little deeper.  I think the optimization(for more parallelism) I suggested is a bit aggressive in some cases.  For example, if you end up having only 101 files to merge(instead of 198) {{Merger}} will merge just 2 files in the first pass and then merge 100 files for the final merge.  Now, if there is a genie that can tell us how many disk files we will create during the course of shuffle/merge we can either opt to wait or kick off the merge as soon as we reach the disk file count greater then {{io.sort.factor.}}  This is something that can be explored later.  For example, if we know that the number of mappers is huge compared to {{io.sort.factor}} and we do not have enough memory for large in-memory merges we can opt for the optimization I suggested.\n\n-- Asokan","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=masokan","name":"masokan","key":"masokan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mariappan Asokan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-03-09T14:07:26.961+0000","updated":"2013-03-09T14:07:26.961+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538742/comment/13670495","id":"13670495","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cos","name":"cos","key":"cos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cos&avatarId=16741"},"displayName":"Konstantin Boudnik","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This has been clearly backported to 2.0.4-alpha in r1453367.
