Vinod or Giri, did you look at the directories before this happened?\n\nIf I don't know what caused the bad directory t begin with I really don't have much hope of understanding how to prevent it in the future.  If the directory was manually created then there is nothing we can do.  If the user explicitly set user.name to jenkins we can detect that, and blow up.\n\nWe cannot delete the directory after a job finishes in local mode because more jobs could still be running.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-03-12T16:34:48.143+0000","updated":"2012-03-12T16:34:48.143+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12539846/comment/13247245","id":"13247245","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"It looks like there is really no way to make code changes unless we can get this to happen again.
