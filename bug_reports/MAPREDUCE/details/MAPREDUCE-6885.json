This can for example cause moving job history files to mapreduce.jobhistory.done-dir to not occur.\n\nThere should be some fail-proof logic here to prevent these events from being lost. Should also be careful that the same exception is not thrown for each event to prevent the logs from being cluttered with the same stacktrace.
