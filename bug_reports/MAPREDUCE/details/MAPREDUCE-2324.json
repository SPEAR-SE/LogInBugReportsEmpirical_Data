I am more concerned about a sustaining release for the 0.20.20X line.  And then look at porting the functionality to MR-279.\n\nI am not sure that it even applies to MR-279 because of how scheduling is different.  My understanding is that the ApplicationMaster will make a request to the ResourceManager for a set of nodes that meet criteria X (I believe that disk space is one of the criteria you can request but it is currently ignored).  The ResourceManager looks at all of the nodes available and hands back a list of nodes that best match the given criteria.  So the ApplicationMaster has no idea at all which, if any nodes were considered and rejected, or even what all of the nodes in the system are.  If we wanted to keep track of individual nodes it would either have to be on the ResourceManager, which does have resource constraints, or in the ApplicationMaster which would now need a list of all nodes in the cluster along with which nodes were tried and rejected for which reasons.  \n\nIn fact mapreduce.reduce.input.limit is not in the MR-279 code base at all, so for MR-279 we need to think about resource limits and scheduling more generally.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-07-14T15:50:52.536+0000","updated":"2011-07-14T15:50:52.536+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498560/comment/13065457","id":"13065457","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I am uploading this patch based off of my initial proposal for limiting the maximum number of times that we try to schedule a reduce task and it fails because of size issues.

The NodeManager can then also report back the amount of disk space that it has free, just like the TaskTracker does.  Then for Reduce Tasks we teh MR Application Master can request the container based off of the estimated reduce input size. We can also put in a more generic resource starvation detection mechanism that would work for both RAM and Disk.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-07-14T20:00:18.756+0000","updated":"2011-07-14T20:00:18.756+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498560/comment/13065540","id":"13065540","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Looking back I realize that I probably have not answered Todd's question satisfactorily.  Yes there are out of band heartbeats, and in fact not every TT heartbeat will make it all the way through to this piece code, because the node may have no slots available by the time it gets to this Job.  The intention was not to verify that the job has been tried on every TT before giving up.  The idea was to do a reasonable effort in trying to schedule the job before giving up.  I suspect that the amount of free disk space on a node may very quite a bit between heartbeats, just because jobs are using disk space that then go away, HDFS is storing a file that is deleted, or several new blocks are added, so even if we give every node a chance at this job before giving up there is still a possibility that it will succeed later on.  We cannot predict the future, but we do need to put an upper bound on how long we try to do something, otherwise there will always be corner cases where we can get starvation.\n\nIt may also make since to use some statistical heuristics in MR-279 to try and give up sooner rather then later if someone is asking for something that is really outside of the norm.

Sorry, was on vacation last week so only partially keeping up with JIRA traffic.\n\nMy worry mostly has to do with this feature being kicked in as a false positive. In general, false positives here are very expensive, whereas false negatives are not nearly as drastic.\n\nFor example, imagine a cluster with 10 nodes and a couple of jobs submitted. One of the nodes is out of disk space. The first job, when submitted, takes up all the reduce slots on the first 9 nodes, but the 10th node is left empty since it's out of space. When the second job is submitted, all of the free reduce slots on the cluster are located on this remaining node. Every time the node heartbeats, the counter will get incremented for the queued up job. After 10 heartbeats, the job will fail, even though it was just a single problematic node.\n\nSo, I think we do need to wait for a scheduling opportunity on at least some number of unique nodes before failing the job. It seems we could do this with a single HashSet per job - whenever any reduce task is successfully scheduld, the set is cleared. Whenever a job is given an opportunity to schedule reduces on a node, but can't due to resource constraints, it's added to the set. Once the size of the set eclipses some percentage of the nodes on the cluster, it fails the job. This memory usage would be O(nodes*jobs) rather than O(nodes*tasks) -- and thus not too bad.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-07-18T19:45:12.253+0000","updated":"2011-07-18T19:45:12.253+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498560/comment/13067264","id":"13067264","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"That is a very good point and I really like the solution.

The scheduling is split up between the resource manager and the application master.  And in fact the resource manager/application master are completely ignoring disk utilization at this point.\n\nThe plan is to add in disk utilization to the resources that the RM uses, and then have AM request both disk and RAM space for reduces with disk space based off of the size estimate currently used.  Then inside the scheduler, which is the right place in my opinion to decide if a request is being starved or not, it would do just what we do not but more generalized for all resource constraints, not just disk.  This means that all schedulers would have to be modified to support this, but I can make the code generic so it should be fairly simple to do.  I just need to dig into the MR-279 code to decide exactly how I want to insert this in.  I should hopefully have a patch by mid next week.

The error message does not say which job it is that cannot be scheduled so we have to manually look at all of the jobs to try and determine which one is causing the problem.  So at a minimum we need to update the error message to include the name of the job.\n\nThe reason we are seeing this is mostly because on our clusters mapreduce.reduce.input.limit is disabled because it was causing a lot of false positives.  Killing jobs that would pass otherwise which we decided was worse then trying to find and manually kill some bad jobs.\n\nAs for your size estimate I contend that it is way off.  First of all it is not 100 bytes.  It is probably closer to 8 bytes, because we are storing a reference to a string that all 5000 failing jobs will share, but lets assume that it is 100 bytes.  For 5000 jobs to be accurate that would mean that somehow 5000 map/reduce jobs each with only 1 or 2 reducers, and a HUGE amount of data going to those reducers, were launched and all are getting to the reducer stage at almost exactly the same time.  I don't think in practice that would ever happen  It would take someone maliciously trying to do this, and launching 5000 jobs at all would probably be shut down by queue limits before it even got here.  I looked at our clusters here and we have at most about 300 jobs running at any point in time on our very large clusters.\n\nSo I would say, as far as an upper bound is concerned,  a closer estimate would be 5000 nodes * 100 * 600 jobs.  This comes out to be about 300MB in the worst case.  I suspect that the worst case is going to be a lot closer to (5000 nodes * 100 bytes) + (8 byte references to strings * 5000 nodes * 80% of nodes before job killed * 400 jobs) = about 13MB.\n\nI agree that there is some uncertainty about how this might perform at a large scale.  So I will try to get some time on our large test cluster to see if I can run a gridmix simulation to verify that it is not going to cause anything bad to happen at scale, and I will also submit a patch that will just change the error message to include the job ID to make it simpler to manually kill off jobs that are stuck.

Currently it is something that someone has to manually guess what the value should be.  What is more this value is likely to need to change as the cluster fills up with data, and as data is deleted off of the cluster.  If it is wrong then either too many jobs fail that would have succeeded or some jobs, probably a very small number, will starve and never finish.  \n\nTo fix it Hadoop would have to automatically set reduce.input.limit dynamically and the only way I can think of to do that would be to gather statistics about all the nodes in the cluster and try to predict how likely this particular reduce will ever find the space it needs on a node.  I believe that we can compute the mean and X% confidence interval for disk space on the cluster without too much difficulty but I have my doubts that this will apply to a small cluster.  From what I read anything under 40 samples tends to be suspect, so it might not work for a cluster under 40 nodes.  Also I am not sure how the statistics would apply to this particular situation.  Would we want to compute this based off of a recent history of cluster of just a snapshot of its current state? If there is history how far back would we want to go, and how would we handle some nodes heart-beating in more regularly then others.  I am not a statistician and I could not find one to look over my work,  so instead I decided to take a bit more of a brute force approach that I know would work.\n\nIf you know a statistician that could provide a robust solution to this problem or at least tell me what if anything I am doing wrong then I am very happy to implement it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-08-01T14:18:07.523+0000","updated":"2011-08-01T14:18:07.523+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12498560/comment/13073677","id":"13073677","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I have been able to run gridmix on a 10 node cluster, and everything looks stable.

We saw this actually happen on the reducer side in a few instances which is why I put in the patch.  we could do something similar on the mapper side, but it was not as urgent.\n\nYes in theory if the getEstimatedReduceInputSide worked correctly, and there was only one node with low disk space then that failure could have been avoided.  I originally looked at implementing something that would try to assign the task to several different nodes before giving up.  But at what point do we say that we have tried enough?  Answering that question along with the memory requirements to do that for every single task attempt resulted in a very complicated solution.  The reason this fix was selected was because it is very simple compaired to the other ones (less risk of breaking something) also getExtimatedReduceInputSize has some issues with it, Arun can better describe them then I can.  He wanted to push for us to address those issues as the ultimate fix for this.\n\nI hope that helps.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-11-23T18:11:40.624+0000","updated":"2011-11-23T18:11:40.624+0000"}],"maxResults":43,"total":43,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-2324/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i09e67:"}}
