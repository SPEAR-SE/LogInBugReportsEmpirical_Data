For each client, RPC layer creates a thread for connection/communication etc. With MAPREDUCE-3256, we need one client per container because of per-container token. So, the number or RPC level threads blows up and you know the rest of the story.\n\nAttaching patch. Taking Karam's help for testing.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-11-02T15:01:45.090+0000","updated":"2011-11-02T15:01:45.090+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12529861/comment/13142234","id":"13142234","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

With lots of help from Karam.\n\nWhat was happening was that after MAPREDUCE-3256, we create one connection per container to a nodeManager and this per-container connection wasn't closed after its use. Soon, the number of threads created by Hadoop RPC per connection reaches the ulimit on the node's number of processes and java beautifully describes it as an out-of-memory error.\n\nI put in a \"RPC.stopProxy(obj)\" call a couple of days back itself, but that didn't work because of the multiple layering of RPC in Yarn.

Looks good mostly.\n- The close call shouldn't really be required with the idle time set to 0.\n- Should RPCClientFactoryPBImpl call RPC.stopProxy ? instead of putting it in all the service client impls? It's a PB specific factory, so putting it here should be ok. Otherwise - the Exception in stopClient() should not be ignored.\n- The client cache (removed by the patch) in ContainerLauncherImpl would still be useful in non-secure mode. This works for both though - so isn't high priority. Maybe a separate jira.\nHaven't tried the latest patch. Had tried the previous one on a single node. Jobs were running fine.
