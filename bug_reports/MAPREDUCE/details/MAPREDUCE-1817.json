Seems like there must be a way we can improve the check so that it really tests that the versions of the code is the same without requiring that the bits be built on exactly the same minute. That's my understanding of what getRevision would do. Any fix will bump the revision number, if the JT gets updated with this revision number it should refuse service to an old TT since the revision won't match right? ie any change to the source should bump the revision number -- if that's not the case then it seems like the real bug is that we need a better notion of \"revision number\". If you're recompiling the code w/o checking in a fix to bump the revision number then there be dragons...\n\nThe motivation is that some users don't run the same version of linux on all the machines in their cluster. For various reasons not everyone standardizes on one install for all machines, even though that's best practice, which means they use different packages, and it's reasonable that different packages are not built at exactly the same time of day. So the option for them today is to either reinstall the OS on a bunch of machines or run two instances of Hadoop, both of which are pretty painful too.\n\nThanks,\nEli\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eli","name":"eli","key":"eli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eli Collins","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-05-26T18:56:04.996+0000","updated":"2010-05-26T18:56:04.996+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12465490/comment/12872135","id":"12872135","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"*SIgh*\n\nLook at the patch for HADOOP-5203.
