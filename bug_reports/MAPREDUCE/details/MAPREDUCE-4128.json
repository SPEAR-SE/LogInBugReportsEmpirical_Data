The only way that status could be changed is if there is a FAILED event for that task, in which case a failed status is assigned to that task. So once a task is marked with a success status, it remains so even when subsequent events kill the successful task attempt and marks it invalid. \nNext the recovery service adds all success status tasks into a completedTasks collection. Then it proceeds to enumerate the events and process them. When it hits a TaskEventType.*_KILLED/FAILED/SUCCEEDED then it removes those attempts from the completedTasks. Recovery does not complete until all attempts of all completedTasks are removed. Now the following sequence of events can happen for Tasks A and B. A1 represents task attempt 1 of A.\nCompletedTasks contains A and B. A1 and A2 are succeeded. A2 was a rerun of A1. B1 is succeeded and B2 was running when AM crashed.\nA1- container request is processed. It uses the nodeid info from A1 to work.\nB1- container request is processed. It uses the nodeid info from B1 to work.\nA1- Succeeded. removes A1\nB1- Succeeded. removes B1\nA2- container request is processed. It uses the nodeid info from A2 to work\nB2- container request is processed. It uses the nodeid info from B2 to work. But there is no such info as it is populated on task attempt completion. AM crashed here while trying to resolve the nodeid.\nIf AM had not crashed the following would have happened\nA2- Succeeded. removes A2\nThere is no FAILED/KILLED/SUCCEEDED event for B2 since it was running when the AM crashed. So it seems the AM would never move out of recovery.\n\nIf the above is correct, there seems to be 2 problems\n1) While recovery is in process, event handling for task attempts that are not in a completed state. I am not sure if the recovery design allows this and the current crash is simply a case of missing info. \n2) Expecting every task attempt of a completedTask to have a KILLED/FAILED/SUCCEEDED entry. This seems to be clearly wrong in the current scenario.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-09T18:05:34.534+0000","updated":"2012-04-09T18:05:34.534+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550252/comment/13250185","id":"13250185","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I have managed to repro this using a modified TestFetchFailure.

Hence it assumes that all attempts of such tasks would also be complete. So it loads completed tasks and replays them till the replay completes all attempts of all completed tasks.\nThis will break whenever there is an attempt running after a previously successful completion because the replay will not have info to correctly work on running attempts.\nScenario 1 : MAPREDUCE-3921 introduces such an instance because it re-runs successful map tasks if the successful attempts had run on a bad machine.\nScenario 2 : Even in the current code, when a successful map is rerun because of too many fetch failures, the above scenario is produced and caused a failure in recovery.\nThe proposed solution in the patch is to make sure that if a task is re-run then it is not marked as completed during recovery. The JobHistoryParser has been changed to remove the \"SUCCEEDED\" status on a task if the successful attempt of that task later reports a failure. This fixes the repro case mentioned above. I have improved that testcase to cover Scenario 1. Scenario 2 will be covered in MAPREDUCE-3921.\nI am expecting the patch to introduce 3 additional warnings because of raw types in event handling (similar to existing warnings).\nI compiled a broken rumen class and test assuming the new field added to TaskFinishedEvent is not relevant to them.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-04-10T01:00:00.225+0000","updated":"2012-04-10T01:00:00.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550252/comment/13250360","id":"13250360","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bikassaha","name":"bikassaha","key":"bikassaha","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=bikassaha&avatarId=29845"},"displayName":"Bikas Saha","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Correction.\nbq.This fixes the repro case mentioned above.
