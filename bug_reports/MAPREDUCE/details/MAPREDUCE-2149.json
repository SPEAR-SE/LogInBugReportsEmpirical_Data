But if the latency is large, setup could take couple of orders of magnitude longer.\n\nE.g. : source has 10k directories, each with about 10 files, round trip latency between source and destination is 75 ms (typical for coast-to-coast clusters). \nIf we run distcp on source cluster, set up would take about _2.5 hours_ irrespective of whether destination has these files or not. '-lsr' on the same dest dir from source cluster would take up to 12 min (depending on how many directories already exist on dest). \n\n  * A fairly simple fix to how setup() iterates should bring the set up time to same as '-lsr'. I will have a patch for this.. (though 12 min is too large).\n  * A more scalable option is to differ update check to
