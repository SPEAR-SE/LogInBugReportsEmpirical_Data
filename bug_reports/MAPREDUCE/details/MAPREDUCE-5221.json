It's absolutely odd, because of the difference of o.a.h.mapred.Reducer and o.a.h.mapreduce.Reduce as you pointed out. Therefore, I've analysed the source code, and I've found some problems:\n\n1. There are no codes to test with MiniMRYarnCluster with launching reduce-side combiner. TestMRAppWithCombiner seems to be enough, but reduce-side combiners are actually not launched because data size is too small to launch combiners.\n2. ShuffleConsumerPlugin.Contexts only accepts Class<? extends o.a.h.mapred.Reducer> when constructing. It's needed to add new ShuffleConsumerPlugin.Contexts which accepts  Class<? extends o.a.h.mapreduce.Reducer>. # Or, change huffleConsumerPlugin.Contexts to accepts Class<?> and check the type with Java reflection API when constructing.\n3. Shuffle#MergeManager only accepts Class<? extends o.a.h.mapred.Reducer>.
