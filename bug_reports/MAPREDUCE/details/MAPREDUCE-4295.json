I just have two minor comments.\n\n# It is BuilderUtils.newContainerToken that could throw the IllegalArgumentException because of a DNS outage.  It might be good to move the creation of the ContainerTokenIdentifier out of the try block so we don't accidentally treat something else as a DNS issue.  This is mostly because IllegalArgumentException really does not indicate that there was a problem resolving a host name, so I would prefer to reduce the chance of handling the error incorrectly.\n# Do we want to log the exception as a string or do we want to pass in the exception as an argument to the log so we get the full stack trace?  In the case of a DNS outage we may not want to fill up the logs with useless messages, but if there is a different error happening I would prefer to have more information to be able to debug it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert
