(a) LinuxTaskController sets 770 as permissions for all the files/directories within this dir recursively and then TT will delete the dir. (b) DefaultTaskController sets rwx for user(same as TT) for this dir recursively and then TT deletes the dir.\n\n(2) Deletion of $jobId is done as earlier because user can't create any files in this dir.\n\n(3) Deletion of work dir in TaskRunner(useful with jvm reuse) is also done by changing the permissions first(no taskcontroller is needed in this case).\n\n(4) With jvm reuse, after final task of a Jvm is finished, workDir is deleted using procedure mentioned in (1) above by task-controller.\n\n(5) Modified TestTaskTrackerLocalization and TestLocalizationWithLinuxTaskController to have directories/files created in $attemptId and set nonwritable permissions which tests whether (a) DefaultTaskController and (b) LinuxTaskController would be able to remove these new files from $attemptId.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ravidotg","name":"ravidotg","key":"ravidotg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Gummadi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-16T07:14:48.526+0000","updated":"2009-11-16T07:14:48.526+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433635/comment/12781783","id":"12781783","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sharadag","name":"sharadag","key":"sharadag","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sharad Agarwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"sigh! the patch has got stale.

I need to still see the C changes, but have the following comments so far:\n\n- I think we should not pass the full path for deletion to the task-controller for security purposes. We should use the pattern we have used for other commands like this:\n task-controller user-name cmd mapred-local-dir job-id task-id is-work-dir\n- PathDeletionContext can have APIs like jobId, taskId, isWorkDir, which it can construct based on the path passed to it.\n- Can we call the API and commands in TaskController as cleanupTask, just so the names are consistent like initializeTask, etc.\n- The new addToQueue API can be package private.\n- We should probably take care that if user or taskController is not null, the other is non-null as well and throw an IllegalArgumentException if it is not.\n- After enabling path for deletion using taskcontroller, we should probably use context.fs.delete(context.path, true). This way the deletion logic remains same. Also, the deletePath implementation can be simplified as follows:\n{code}\n  if (context.taskController != null) {\n    context.taskController.cleanupTask(context); \n  }\n  return context.fs.delete(context.path, true);\n{code}\n- I don't think LinuxTaskController must do context.fs.delete in case arguments in pathdeletioncontext are incorrect. This can hide errors and result in the undeleted directories.\n- There is a change in JVMManager where the workdir for the last task was being deleted inline, but now we delete it asynchronously. Is this OK ? It seems like it should be because there is no reuse of directories after this point and hence, a little delay in cleaning up the workdir shouldn't have any effect.\n- The change in setupWorkDir does not seem to be creating a workDir after deletion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-03T06:22:25.883+0000","updated":"2009-12-03T06:22:25.883+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433635/comment/12785787","id":"12785787","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Some comments on the C code and testcases:\n\n- I feel secure_path is a better API name than change_permissions - any specific reason for the change ?\n- The parameter 'secure' can be renamed 'check_ownership' to better reflect its intent.\n- Why do we need check_group ?\n- Please document the permissions being set in the comments describing enable_path_for_deletion, like is done for other methods like initialize_user.\n- Typo in test case createFileAndSetPermissions ? a=rw should be a-rw  \n- The error in TestLocalizationWithLinuxTaskController.testUserLocalization could be better fixed by refactoring the test cases in TestLocalizationWithLinuxTaskController and TestTaskTrackerLocalization as follows:\n  Define a method canRun() in TestTaskTrackerLocalization and call it as the first statement in every test in TestTaskTrackerLocalization.

Some comments:\n\n- TaskTracker.buildPathForDeletion need not be public.\n- Was there a need to change CleanupQueue.addToQueue to take a FileSystem as argument instead of Configuration ? It has caused more changes than required by this patch - like in JobTracker and JobInProgress. Can we retain the original API and pass in a Configuration as before ? \n- When adding a task directory to delete, we are adding paths from all the local directories instead of just the one where files for the task are actually created. At a minimum, this is more work being done than necessary. More importantly, I don't know if there are any side effects this will cause. We can check which among the local directories the path belongs to (by doing a startsWith on the path) and all only that I think.\n- Shouldn't getLocalDirs take the tasktracker's configuration always ? In which case, it doesn't need to take the JobConf as a parameter, but can use fConf.\n- The log statements in CleanupQueue.PathCleanupThread.run are printing context.path which will only be the mapred local dir. We actually need the full path, otherwise the log statements could be confusing. Indeed, I would suggest a slight refactoring of the PathDeletionContext class, because as it exists currently we have one mode or the other that works - either a fullPath is provided or the path is built from other bits of data - like jobId, taskId etc. So, I would suggest something along the following lines:\n{code}\nclass PathDeletionContext {\n  String fullPath;\n  FileSystem fs;\n\n  protected String getPathForDeletion() {\n    return fullPath;\n  }\n\n  protected void enablePathForCleanup() {\n    // do nothing\n  }\n}\n\nclass TaskControllerPathDeletionContext extends PathDeletionContext {\n  String user;\n  String jobId;\n  String taskId;\n  boolean isCleanupTask;\n  boolean isWorkDir;\n  TaskController taskController;\n  Path p;\n\n  @Override\n  protected String getPathForDeletion() {\n    TaskTracker.buildPathForDeletion(this);\n  }\n\n  @Override\n  protected void enablePathForCleanup() {\n    taskController.enablePathForCleanup(this);\n  }\n}\n{code}\n\nThen we can use PathDeletionContext in all cases where we don't need to use the taskController and the sub-class in other cases. CleanupQueue will naturally take and store PathDeletionContext objects. getPathForDeletion can be called to get the final path for deletion. I feel this design is cleaner. Thoughts ?\n- DefaultTaskController.enableTaskForCleanup should be package private.\n- In other APIs of LinuxTaskController - like buildLaunchTaskArgs, we find out if the task is a cleanup task and adjust paths directly. I think we can do the same thing for the new command also. This is not less secure, because we are still constructing the full path from the command args, but we abstract the task-controller from details like cleanup task. It is less clear whether the same thing should be done for workDir (i.e. should we append that to taskid in LinuxTaskController itself.) For that we may need a flag still, but I am OK if that is also resolved in LinuxTaskController itself and we completely eliminate flags to pass to task-controller.\n- The List of args in buildChangePathPermissionsArgs should be of the right size. (It's not 5). Also, I think it is useful to retain the order of commands the same. i.e. Let the mapred local dir be the first argument, then job-id, then task-id.\n- I think we must allocate the exact amount of memory required in build_dir_path. This can be done by defining a format string like TT_LOCAL_TASK_SCRIPT_PATTERN and then summing the lengths of this string, and the arguments like jobid, taskid, mapred local dir etc. Then we can use snprintf to build the path instead of multiple (unsafe) strcat and strcpy calls. Again, please look at get_task_file_path for an example.\n- Return values of calls like malloc should all be checked. When this is done, calls to build_dir_path can fail, which must also be checked.\n- In TaskRunner.deleteDirContents, I think if we get an InterruptedException, we should return immediately. Because otherwise, the operation is not really interrupted and it can get stuck permanently.\n- The intent of the testcase in TestChildTaskDirs is nice. But I am worried that since directory cleanup happens asynchronously, this might fail due to timing issues (like the TODO in the comment says). One option could be to use an inline directory cleaner. Can we try that ? \n- Should we also verify that the taskattemptdir is also cleaned up ?\n- There are some TODOs in the tests, can you please remove them after addressing the concerns ?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-06T06:36:45.458+0000","updated":"2009-12-06T06:36:45.458+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433635/comment/12787382","id":"12787382","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ravidotg","name":"ravidotg","key":"ravidotg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Gummadi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"> Was there a need to change CleanupQueue.addToQueue to take a FileSystem as argument instead of Configuration ?

Locally, I ran this several times and every time it passed. Without logs it is difficult to debug this issue. And as Ravi pointed out, it appears it has been observed previously.\n\nThe failure in TestServiceLevelAuthorization could be explained though. Essentially, the test case is failing at a place where it assumes that the localized job directories are cleaned up. However, this cleanup is asynchronous in nature and hence, because of timing issues it can fail. However, it is also true that this patch could make the failure situation a little more probable as it does more work in the asynchronous cleanup code. Since the issue is inherently present in the test case even without this patch, we can fix it in a follow-up JIRA. The advantage we get is that we merge this reasonably complex patch on trunk, thereby avoiding more merge conflicts, like I discovered today.

As explained above, this method verifies an exact list of localized directories on a tasktracker. To do so, it seems to wait until the TTs become idle. But idleness is only a function of the number of active tasks. When tasks complete, the TT adds directories to be deleted to the CleanupQueue, which by default, asynchronously deletes them. Clearly that means that waiting for the TTs to become idle is not a sufficient pre-condition for the testing of localized directory contents.\n\nLike I explained, this problem exists on trunk as well. But this patch can increase the chances of hitting it more often, because it does more work in the asynchronous portion. Given that, I am not comfortable committing it, particularly as there's no blazing hurry for this patch right now. We do run a risk of the patch going stale, but I am relying on the holiday season to slow people down (*smile*). More importantly, we'll not make the test scene worse than it already is.\n\nAs regards the fix, a simple solution may be to configure the MiniMRCluster with an inline cleanup queue whenever we want to check the deletion of localized files and directories - essentially in all test cases that use TestMiniMRWithDFS.checkTaskDirectories. Fortunately, there are only four of them right now. Another option could be to wait until the cleanup queue is empty. The disadvantage with this approach is that it uses the much maligned \"sleep(100) until some condition is satisfied\" pattern. I would use the former approach instead, which has worked well elsewhere. It may slow the tests down a tad bit, but hopefully not too badly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-12-23T05:53:09.340+0000","updated":"2009-12-23T05:53:09.340+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433635/comment/12794310","id":"12794310","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ravidotg","name":"ravidotg","key":"ravidotg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ravi Gummadi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I could reproduce the failure of TestServiceLevelAuthorization consistently by adding a sleep in CleanupQueue.deletePath() before actual deletion and making the cleanup queue inline solved the issue.\nModified the tests that use MiniMRCluster and validate deletion of files/dirs through CleanupQueue to use inline cleanup queue.
