It also seems like we don't want generally users to be able to read other's job history files.

This is very well published in the job summary, stored in the job status cache within jobtracker and later archived to completed-job-status-store. Maybe we can reuse these features (i.e the job status cache and status store).\n# We should log jobhistory activities like \n  ## jobhistory folder regex used\n  ## jobid to foldername mappings\n  Logging will help in debugging and post mortem analysis.\n# Formats can change across runs. How do we plan to take care of that. One thing we can do it to have a unique folder per pattern for storing the files. The (unique) folder-name should be based on the jobhistory structure pattern. This mapping of jobhistory folder regex to the foldername should be logged. \n  Clients that need really old jobhistory files analyzed, will dig up the jobhistory folder format, map it to the folder, provide the _username_, _jobid_ and _finishtime_ to get the file. The client can get the _username_ and _finishtime_ by quering the JobTracker for the job status (via completed-jobstatus-store). See _Future Steps #1_.\n# How about keeping _N_ items in the top level directory and moving them to the appropriate place only when the total item count crosses _N_. \n  Example (assume /done/%user/%jobid as the format and N=5)\n  ## The first job gets added to /done/job1\n  ## 5th job gets added to /done/job5\n  ## 6th job gets added to /done/job6 and /done/job1 gets moves to /done/user1/job1\n  ## and so on\nSo the movement happens only on overflow. The benefit of this change is that without any indexing, we can show the recent N jobs on the jobhistory webui. This pattern can be enabled for all subfolders also. So if the jobhistory format specified is %user/ then queries like '_give the recent 5 items all the users_' can also be answered quickly.\n# Webui should provide 2 views\n   ## top/recent few (show jobs from the topmost level folder)\n   ## browse-able view where YYYY/MM/DD etc is shows as it is. This can be configurable and turned off for complicated structures like 00/00/00-99 etc, which the users might now be able to make sense. Also there should be somekind of widget in JobHistory that given _username_, _joibid_ and _finishtime_ provides the complete jobhistory filename. See _Future steps #2_.\n# bq. .... He raised the issue that a practical cluster has more distinct users than we would want to create DFS directories, especially if the directory structure is further split on timestamps.\nI would prefer username to be one of the configuration options. Since its configurable, it can be turned off for clusters having lots of users.\n\nFuture steps :\n# As of today, we have jobhistory files directly dumped in the done folder. We might want to move these files in the format we want (for a good user experience). Maybe some kind of offline admin tool can help here (maybe under mradmin?). It might make sense to name the final jobhistory file (leaf-level) as $username_$jobid_$finishtime. This will enable use to restructure job history files across various formats. \n# There should be someway to find out which regex/format was used given the jobtracker start time (which is one of the components in jobid). To make it easier for clients, maybe the log files related to jobhistory upadates can be published or the JobTracker should be in a position to answer this.\nThoughts?

However, the important operations should be supported, with good performance, preferably in the {{jobhistory.jsp}} interface.  We have to support reasonable searches in the {{jsp}} .  To that end, I would to do the following:\n\n1: let the done jobs' directory structure be {{DONE/jobtracker-timestamp/123/456/789}} where {{123456789}} is the job ID serial number.  Leading zeros are depicted in the directory even if they're not in the serial number.  Perhaps {{jobtracker-timestamp}} should be {{jobtracker-id}} ?\n\n2: In the {{jsp}}, we could present newest jobs first.  This is probably what people want, and in common cases it speeds up the presentation when the user displays an early page.  With the current naming convention,these are the jobs with the lexicographically latest file names.\n\n3: All the URLs in the {{jsp}} pages [including those behind forms] would have a starting job tracker ID and serial number encoded, so we can continue from where we left off, even though we keep adding new jobs to the beginning because of 2: .  Subsequent pages will not overlap previous pages just because new jobs have been added at the beginning.\n\n4: When we do searches, we work back through the directories in reverse order, so we can stop when we populate a page rather than reading all of the history files' names.\n\n5: For low-yield searches we'll consider offering to stop after, say, 10K non-matching jobs have been ignored.  This lets us process mistyped queries in a reasonable time.\n\n6: The start time is of interest.  Inside the {{JobHistory}} code, as the cached history files are being copied to the {{DONE}} directory, an approximation of the start time is available in the modification time of the {{conf.xml}} file.  We can copy that, either to the modification time of the new job history file [using {{setTime}}], or encode it into the filename in some manner [as we do with the job name].  Either way, we can then present it in the {{jsp}} result, or filter based on time ranges.  What does the community think?\n\n7: Perhaps there needs to be a programmatic API as well, reducing the need for people to read directories.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-06-10T18:05:42.775+0000","updated":"2010-06-10T18:05:42.775+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12877559","id":"12877559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"My proposal does present the display faster when the history files are numerous, but we do lose the ability to display the total amount or to jump to the last page.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-06-10T20:38:01.097+0000","updated":"2010-06-10T20:38:01.097+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12877567","id":"12877567","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"> 7: Perhaps there needs to be a programmatic API as well, reducing the need for people to read directories.\n\nIn fact, I worry we are building something to make a faster UI but making it impossible to use in any other manner.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2010-06-10T20:46:03.875+0000","updated":"2010-06-10T20:46:03.875+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12877614","id":"12877614","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The scope of this issue has not been well defined. The designs are arguing about the correct subset of a database to implement for JobHistory, leaving a wide range of known (and as Allen points out, unknown) use cases ill served. This will not converge quickly.\n\nFor purposes of consensus, this issue is a bug; the _existing_ functionality is not handled efficiently. It should go without saying that the design should not be over-specific to today's use cases, but the issue's focus should remain on solving the problems cited and servicing the use cases already in the system. This is a misbehaving component, not a project implementing a small database in HDFS. Perhaps the title should change to reflect this.\n\nThere are 3 operations to support (please amend as necessary):\n# Lookup by JobID. This should not be worse than O\\(log n) (and should be O\\(1)), as it is a frequent operation.\n# Find a set of jobs run by a particular user\n# Find a set of jobs with names matching a regex\n\n(2) and (3) can require a scan, but the cost should be bounded. If there are common operator activities (like archiving old history, etc) then the layout should support that, but arbitrary queries are out of scope.\n\nThe problems with the flat hierarchy are, obviously, the cost of listing files both in the JobTracker and NameNode. This can be ameliorated, somewhat, by HDFS-1091 and HDFS-985, but further optimizations/caching are possible if one can assume that recent entries are more relevant.\n\nDick/[Doug|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-323?focusedCommentId=12771987&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12771987]'s format looks sound to me. Amar identified many complexities in implementing the configurable-schema, mini-database proposal and in my opinion: while the solutions are feasible, the virtues of a simpler fix for this issue outweigh the costs of solving those problems.\n\nI particularly like the idea of bounding scans of JobHistory to _n_ entries, unless the user requests a deeper search. Caching recent entries, metadata about which subdirectories are sufficent for _n_ entries, etc. are all reasonable optimizations, but adopting the new layout should be sufficient for this issue.

There won't be very many directories on this level.\n\n{{YYYY/MM/DD}} documents the date of completion [actually, the date that the history file is copied to DFS].\n\n{{987654}} are the leading six digits of the job serial number, considered as a nine-digit integer.  The leading zeros ARE included, so the directories can be enumerated correctly in lexicographical order.  Therefore, no directory will have more than 2000 files, except in the unlikely case that there are more than 2 million jobs in one day.\n\n2: We will modify the web application, {{jobhistory.jsp}} , in the following ways:  \n\n2a: We will decide how many jobs to filter based on the following criteria\n\n2a1: We stop at 11 tranches of serial numbers [the tenth boundary] or a day boundary, whichever comes first [but that page delivers buttons inviting you to ask for previous days,or more tranches].  Of course, as now, we stop at 100 items if we get that many items before crossing the directory boundary, but in the new code we will remember where to continue.  However, in the new codebase we won't {{ls}} the files we don't present, improving the responsiveness accordingly.\n\n2b: We will present the job history links, newest first.\n\n2b1: To make this coherent, we will remember where we left off for pagination\n\nTo summarize how the code will work, the pagination controls will look like this:\n\nAvailable Jobs in History (displaying 100 jobs from 1 to 100) {{[show all] [show 1000 per page] [show entire day] [first page][last page]}}\n\n{{< golem-jt1.megacorp.com-2010-05-18 golem-jt1.megacorp.com-2010-04-18 >}} [current JT instance, previous and/or following.

Currently we display oldest first, but I'm thinking of changing that because I judge \"most recent first\" to be the better default, especially as uptimes increase as the product becomes more mature.  What do you think?\n\nUsers can change direction by going to \"last page\" -- or \"oldest/newest date\" -- or \"oldest/newest task tracker\".  When you've done that, the navigation cursors change so you're going in the right direction.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-06-15T01:38:28.550+0000","updated":"2010-06-15T01:38:28.550+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12879028","id":"12879028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cutting","name":"cutting","key":"cutting","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Cutting","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"> After some discussions, we've come to some decisions.\n\nDo you mean the discussion above, or some other discussion?

In particular, web users can search for jobs with a certain user, and jobs whose job name contains a certain substring.  \n\nAfter a search, the current API allows the user to page through the data.  They get told the total number of matching jobs, and they can browse pages of data, with 100 jobs per page.  They can access the first and last page from any page, and from any pages they can access any of the previous or following five pages [if there are that many].\n\n2: During restart, we perform searches for specific quadruples of jobtracker IDs, job-ID, username and jobname.  This may be redundant but that's what we do in the current code base.\n\n3: I understand that some installations archive tranches of job history files periodically, usually by date.\n\nHere is how I support the claim that we support these use cases, with considerable scaling and responsiveness improvements:\n\n1: If I use a subdirectory structure based on jobtracker IDs and then dates and then high order digits of the jobid serial number, then the performance of each of these three usage cases can be improved.  I described potential improvements of use case 1 on 14/Jun/10 at 09:38 PM .  To summarize, you will be able to browse by dates and time ranges as well as by the other criteria, and performance will be improved as we only search the subset of the directories we need to satisfy the query or to present the first page of the results.  \n\nIf we make changes along these lines we will no longer present to the user the total number of matching jobs.  One of the complaints that lead to this jira is, after all, the possibility of a scaling problem if there are too many jobs.\n\n2: Because of directory restrictions, the namenode will have to generate alot fewer data, and there will be a lot less client side filtering as well if you have directories consisting of only 1000 jobs [2000 files].\n\n3: We could archive a day's results by harchiving a date subdirectory.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-06-16T22:53:49.473+0000","updated":"2010-06-16T22:53:49.473+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12879570","id":"12879570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"On a separate issue, I received a suggestion that we have a distinguished file extension such as {{.jhist}} for job history files.  {{FileSystem.globStatus(Path)}} can select the config {{.xml}} files, but \n\n1: This is not perfect, as the text {{\".xml\"}} can inprinciple occur at the end of a job history file name, and \n\n2: the globbing language does not have a \"give me all files _except_\" operator.

The name of the file contains nough information about the job to let an application tell whether the file documents a job that satisfies a search criterion.  In particular, it includes the job tracker instance ID, the job ID, the user name, and the job name.\n\nAs the job progresses, records get added to the file, and when it's finished [either successfully or failed] the file is moved to another directory, the completed job history files directory [the \"DONE directory\"]. Currently this directory has a simple flat structure.  If an application [in particular, the job history browser] wants some job histories, it reads this directory and chooses the files with names that indicate that the files will meet the criteria.  In practical cases this can includes hundreds of thousands or even a million files.  Note that each job is represented by two files, the history file and the config file, doubling the burden on the name node.\n\n                                     proposal\n\nI would like to implement a simple data base to solve this problem.  My proposal has the following features:\n\n1: The DONE directory will contain subdirectories, each containing a few hundred or a thousand files.\n\n2: At any time, the job tracker will be filling one of the DONE directory's subdirectories.  All the rest are closed out, never to be added to again.\n\n3: The subdirectories have a naming scheme so they're created in lexicographical  rder.  We would like to use subdirectory names like 2010-07-23--0000, etc [the four digits are a serial number, not an HHMM field].\n\n4: When the job tracker decides to bind off a subdirectory and start a new one, it creates a new index file in the subdirectory it's closing out.  That index is a simple list of the history files the directory contains.\n\n4a: The job tracker starts a new subdirectory whenever the first history file is copied on a given day, and whenever the current subdirectory would otherwise contain more than a certain number of files. \n\n4b: Perhaps the files can be renamed?  These files' names are a few dozen characters each, and in a system that has run a half million jobs the names collectively occupy 100+ megabytes in the name node.  Significant, but not decisive. \n\n4b1: 4b would require that rumen understand indices.\n\n5: The processing is:\n\n5a: [optional] create a new short name for every file in the subdirectory that's being closed out\n\n5a1: The job tracker keeps this information in memory.

That ties up a tread, so we need an additional one to move \nthe mail.\n\n\nIndeed it isn't.\n\nI left it in the parameter chain because future code changes may use it. \n   In particular we might place a ceiling on how many jobs there could \never come to be in one subdirectory, and that would take a JobID to enforce.\n\n\nActually, I have it backwards.  We're indexing on every call, whether it \nneeds it or not, which is bad.  I'll fix this.\n\n\nYeah, when I abstracted out buildIndex I didn't delete enough code from \nthe inline.\n\n\nI make the 5 minute checkpoints because there is a small exposure to \nsome history logs not getting indexed after a job tracker crash.  This \nmeasure reduces the exposure.\n\nI made the busy wait loop 30 seconds, rather than one second, and on \nevery pass to reduce the load and to make this code run only as often as \nit needs to.  However, I therefore increased the thread pool size to THREE:\n\n1 to be in the loop waiting for the hour to end,\n\n1 to be obsolete because the hour already ended during its half minute \nbut it doesn't realize it yet, and\n\n1 to copy a history file.\n\nThat's three.  If we're in the usual case where there is only one \ninstance busy-waiting, then two instances might flow into the copying \ncode.  This is harmless but not useful [since the whole copying code is \nrun with the lock taken].\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-08-26T00:11:16.042+0000","updated":"2010-08-26T00:11:16.042+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12408627/comment/12903113","id":"12903113","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This file is a new patch incorporating some of the review comments by Krishna .\n\nWhat follows is a suggested release notes:\n\nThis patch does four things:\n\n   * it changes the directory structure of the done directory that holds history logs for jobs that are completed, \n   * it builds toy databases for completed jobs, so we no longer have to scan 2N files on DFS to find out facts about the N jobs that have completed since the job tracker started [which can be hundreds of thousands of files in practical cases], \n   * it changes the job history browser to display more information and allow more filtering criteria, and\n   * it creates a new programmatic interface for finding files matching user-chosen criteria.
