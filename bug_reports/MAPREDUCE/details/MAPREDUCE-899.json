This is done by a plain run of the task-controller binary.\n\nNo new tests are included, existing tests  test this issue when combined with various combinations of ownership on the binary.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-28T08:02:54.312+0000","updated":"2009-08-28T08:02:54.312+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433661/comment/12750895","id":"12750895","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hmm. There are assumptions we are making about the setup that may/may not be true in practise.

If there is no error, we should (of course) reset _errno_ to zero for further ops.\n - {{TTConfig.TT_TASK_CONTROLLER_GROUP}} seems to be only for internal use. In that case, let's not even put it in there and instead put it possibly in {{ClusterWithLinuxTaskController}}. Correspondingly we will not need the documentation changes in mapred-default.xml\n - We should also update the forrest documentation regarding this change.\n\nClusterWithLinuxTaskController.java\n - {{createTaskControllerConf()}} can either (1) take the group name itself as an argument instead of a whole conf object or (2) only take a conf object and extract both local-dirs and group name from the conf object.\n - Instead of giving the default value of {{System.getProperty(TASKCONTROLLER_PATH)+ \"/task-controller\"}} to {{taskControllerExePath}}, you can use {{setTaskControllerExe()}} whenever needed.\n - As for the changes to generate the {{taskcontroller.cfg}} file here and in {{MiniMRCluster}}, I think there is a lot easier way of doing this which avoids the changes to {{MiniMRCluster}}\n    -- For general ClusterWithLinuxTaskController tests, we can disable the binary checks by overriding LinuxTaskController.setup() method and can then simply generate the configuration file after the cluster starts so that further checks done when tasks are launched can go smoothly.\n    -- The changes to the tests in the current patch already test that the checks are done successfully during task startup. To verify the checks during TT startup, we can add simple unit tests which just start the TT with/without group name and with invalid group name.\n  Does that work?\n - Currently, number of TTs is a final constant 1 in this class. It doesn't really suport more nodes in that each TT will then need its own copy of binary file. This is because a binary is tied to a config file. So the multiple TTs case won't work with multiple configs but a single binary. Should we copy the binary to each TT's space and generate multiple configs? Or leave it as is and comment on NUMBER_OF_NODES saying to change it to more than 1, we will need more changes?\n\nNits:\n - taskcontroller.cfg: Can you modify the comment for mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group to be \"The group owner of the task controller binary\"?\n - LinuxTaskController: In setp() method, can you change the log statement @114 to warn level and enhance the log statement too saying {{setup()}} failed because of invalid permissions/ownership on the binary?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-01-07T06:37:05.727+0000","updated":"2010-01-07T06:37:05.727+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433661/comment/12802706","id":"12802706","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Patch incorporating most of the review comments. \n\nbq. TTConfig.TT_TASK_CONTROLLER_GROUP seems to be only for internal use.\nI dont think it is only for internal use. Though currently it is read only in TaskController, I think it is like any other configuration. After MAPREDUCE-849, it should to be categorized into one the categories : Cluster/JobTracker/TaskTracker/Client/Job. So, this goes into TaskTracker. Does that make sense?\n\nbq. taskcontroller.cfg: Can you modify the comment for mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group to be \"The group owner of the task controller binary\"\nWith the above explanation, I think this change is not needed. The comment is in consistent with other config comments.\n\nbq. Instead of giving the default value of System.getProperty(TASKCONTROLLER_PATH)+ \"/task-controller\" to taskControllerExePath, you can use setTaskControllerExe() whenever needed.\nNow that TaskTracker constructor (which calls TaskController.setup()) requires this value to be set, we cannot postpone setting of taskControllerExePath after the constructor (as earlier). Since default value can be constructed statically, there is no harm setting the default value for taskControllerExePath.\n\nbq. For general ClusterWithLinuxTaskController tests, we can disable the binary checks by overriding LinuxTaskController.setup() method and can then simply generate the configuration file after the cluster starts so that further checks done when tasks are launched can go smoothly.\nI have done this by overriding LinuxTaskController.setup() method to set set task-controller group and writing the configuration file and then calling super.setup(). \n\nbq.

Only minor finishing touches needed for the documentation:\n - mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group is an unusual configuration item documented in mapred-default.xml. It is not directly used by the TT daemon itself, but instead by the task-controller binary and that to only when LinuxTaskController is configured for the TT. I think we should state this clearly in mapred-default.xml. Also we should point to the taskcontroller.cfg file where it is actually needed to be configured.\n - cluster_setup.xml changes also need some update.  We should say that mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group needs to be configured in mapred-site.xml and taskcontroller.cfg. For better organization, we may move taskcontroller.cfg to a sub-section and refer to that. Also the special group may now contain other members like admin users besides TT unlike before. Though having job-submitters themselves as other members will compromise security. We should change the description to reflect this. The example that follows should also be inline with this. Minor typo in mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group description in taskcontroller.cfg section - it should be \"TaskTracker should belong *to* this group\"","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2010-01-22T05:18:46.773+0000","updated":"2010-01-22T05:18:46.773+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433661/comment/12805362","id":"12805362","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Patch updating the documentation as Vinod suggested.\n\nRan ant docs on my machine.

Specifically, the binary would be setuid/setgid executable, owned by root/a special group, and importantly, other users will not have any permissions. I had proposed on this JIRA earlier on that we trust administrators to setup the special group correctly and specify it in the taskcontroller.cfg file. \n\nFollowing up on this, I think if we verify that only root and the admin specified group can execute the file in a setuid mode, then I think we are pretty much done.

It's a more natural code ordering than what exists currently, which is user, permissions, then group.\n- Rather than check errno as return of getgrgid, it seems more conventional to check for return value being null. This is what man states anyway for return values of getgrgid. It was not clear to me that errno will be set to non-zero if the GID does not exist. However note that errno can still be captured and used for strerror.\n- Should we rename mapreduce.tasktracker.taskcontroller.group to a more generic name and purpose like mapreduce.tasktracker.group. We could document that this is the group to which the tasktracker belongs and qualify that if LinuxTaskController is used, it takes more meaning - in that it should be the group owner of the binary etc.\n- The wait introduced for in the ClusterWithLinuxTaskController does not seem required, because doesn't MiniMRCluster itself wait for clusters to join ? Can you please check if the timeout code you added actually helps ?\n\nThinking about tests, I think it is difficult to actually test all the paths verified by the C code without mocking the system calls or building different binary executables and setting them up with different permissions. While we work out details to improve the way we run LinuxTaskController tests - MAPREDUCE-1429, MAPREDUCE-1300 - I'd request you to document as a comment on this JIRA the various manual tests you have run with different binary permissions / ownership.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2010-01-29T11:18:23.917+0000","updated":"2010-01-29T11:18:23.917+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12433661/comment/12806332","id":"12806332","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amareshwari","name":"amareshwari","key":"amareshwari","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amareshwari Sriramadasu","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Patch with comments addressed.\n\nbq.

Then httpServer.getPort() seems to have returned -1.  This is the same scenario that was described in HADOOP-4744 and was worked around in Map/Reduce by failing the TaskTracker when we hit this condition. We need a fix in Jetty or a workaround like in this in DFS also to avoid the problem. I will open a separate JIRA for this.\n\nThe second testcase, IMO failed because the first did not finish correctly in this case. Since in ClusterMapReduceTest, the dfsCluster is not initialized correctly, I suppose a partial setup has happened, but the corresponding cleanup did not, because ClusterMapReduceTest.teardown() would not have done anything. And this resulted in the second test to fail.\n\nEither way both test failures are unrelated to this patch.
