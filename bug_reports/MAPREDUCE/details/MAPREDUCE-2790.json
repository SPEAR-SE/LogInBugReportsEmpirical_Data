This is provided by the getContainerInfo(). getSchedulingInfo() provides the URL for the AM. (the AM info).\n\n\n- Ravi\n\n\n-----------------------------------------------------------\nThis is an automatically generated e-mail.

The constructor signatures have been changed significantly between 0.20 and 0.23 already. 0.23 hasn't been released yet. \nJobStatus in 0.23 is quite far removed from that in 0.20. In my opinion I think we should mark these interfaces as unstable for some time.\n\n\nbq.

Ideally I'd like to see what resources are being used by a job currently. As we add other attributes to containers, the data structure you proposed will have to be modified (to include CPU / disk etc). Furthermore it provides no tangible benefit. Having a String being formulated at the resource manager gives the resource manager the freedom to describe the resource allocation in its own terms rather than the Clients having to interpret data structures.\n\n\nbq.

I did not find an associated JIRA. Do we have JIRAs associated to all the TODO's in code? We should. And then reference them in the TODO line.

This is provided by the getContainerInfo(). getSchedulingInfo() provides the URL for the AM. (the AM info).\n{quote}\n\nCan you please comment this better then, because just about everyone who looked at the code thought it was a bug.\n\n{quote}\nWhich binary compatibility are we talking about here? Between which two versions? The constructor signatures have been changed significantly between 0.20 and 0.23 already. 0.23 hasn't been released yet.\nJobStatus in 0.23 is quite far removed from that in 0.20. In my opinion I think we should mark these interfaces as unstable for some time.\n{quote}\n\nI am talking about compatibility between 0.20 and 0.23.  Specifically there is user code out there that might use some of these interfaces and it would be nice to not require them to look up new APIs and change their code to get the same behavior as before.  That is why the API is marked as public and stable.  Adding in new constructors or methods will not break compatibility, but changing the parameters to existing ones will.  If it is simple to do I would prefer that we do it.  If the constructor signatures have already changed between 0.20 and 0.23 then don't worry about them.\n\n{quote}\nFurthermore it provides no tangible benefit.\n{quote}\n\nI disagree.  It does not provide a benefit right now, but I have heard a request to have the list of containers being used by an application be accessible (I don't know the JIRA if there is one yet).  I can see lots of use cases coming in the future to be able to have access to this type of information.  Also what happens in the future if we ever do decided to do localization?  The Resource Manager before it returns a string will have to know what the local is for the user it is talking to.  Providing raw data, and then formatting that data at the interface level I think is a lot cleaner then returning an arbitrarily formatted string.\n\n{quote}\nAs we add other attributes to containers, the data structure you proposed will have to be modified (to include CPU / disk etc).\n{quote}\n\nI agree and it may take a bit more effort to think about how you want to set up the data structure so it can expand easily.  But just because it is harder does not mean it is not the right thing to do.  Perhaps you just provide a summary in the job info with the container usage data in it and then in the future we have a separate API to get the details of containers used.\n\n{quote}\nThe commit that introduced the TODO line corresponds to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2807. I did not find an associated JIRA. Do we have JIRAs associated to all the TODO's in code? We should. And then reference them in the TODO line. But I'm afraid I couldn't find a JIRA corresponding to this line.\n{quote}\n\nI agree with all TODOs need a JIRA.  I thought at some point there was a JIRA to look at all the TODOs in MRV2 and fix/file JIRAs for them.  I am not sure what happened to that.  If you could start putting the JIRA in the TODO comments for filing a JIRA for any TODOs that would be great.  I was just curious because the scope of that TODO has now increased with this change and it would be nice to update the JIRA accordingly.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-13T13:55:27.000+0000","updated":"2011-09-13T13:55:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518354/comment/13103739","id":"13103739","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raviprak","name":"raviprak","key":"raviprak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raviprak&avatarId=10113"},"displayName":"Ravi Prakash","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"@Bobby, Jeff, Arun : Thanks for your comments. :) I am uploading a new patch which addresses most of your comments.
