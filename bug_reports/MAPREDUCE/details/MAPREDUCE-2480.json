An app is tied to a specific version of shuffle be it the request format or the authentication data. Shuffle Service isn't really 'known' to the NM, it is an abstract service started by NM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-05-10T05:52:08.582+0000","updated":"2011-05-10T05:52:08.582+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12506662/comment/13031035","id":"13031035","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"To further clarify, the dependency, ideally, should not be on the implementation but rather on some kind of interface exposed by the shuffle service.

It should not depend on a specific implementation class but rather an SPI that both the app and the shuffle implementation depend on. In this case, the SPI is the service id at the moment. If you rename the ShuffleHandler to ShuffleHandlerImpl the code would look wrong too.\n\nNow you have a runtime classpath dependency on a specific shuffle implementation for mr app. If you replace the jar with a different class and update the config, the NM will happily load the service but the mr app won't even run due to class not found exception.
