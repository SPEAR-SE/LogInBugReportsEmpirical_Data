New function does simple transfer by using an intermediate buffer in memory to transfer data from a disk and send to a socket. Size of the intermediate buffer determines the size of the IO requests. This way it is possible to manage size of the IO request in the shuffle phase. Managing the size of the IO requests turns to be important from the performance point of view on the Windows machines.\n\nI observed that the new code improves AVG Shuffle Time on windows for 1.8x.

The JDK does not really implement a zero-copy transfer on Windows.  I checked the source code for OpenJDK 6, 7 and 8, and they all look like this in FileChannelImpl.c:\n\n{code}\nJNIEXPORT jlong JNICALL\nJava_sun_nio_ch_FileChannelImpl_transferTo0(JNIEnv *env, jobject this,\n                                            jint srcFD,\n                                            jlong position, jlong count,\n                                            jint dstFD)\n{\n    return IOS_UNSUPPORTED;\n}\n{code}\n\nOn Linux, these functions delegate to the {{sendfile}} syscall.  It's a shame that this isn't available in the Windows JDK, because it's theoretically possible to do a zero-copy transfer on Windows using {{TransmitFile}}:\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms740565(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nI think it's fine to proceed with this buffer-copying patch, but I also wonder if we'd see even better performance if we could figure out a JNI call to {{TransmitFile}}.\n\nI'll review the patch in more detail later.  From a quick glance, it looked like there were a few cases of indentation using 4 spaces instead of 2 spaces (the project standard).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-13T19:16:42.522+0000","updated":"2014-03-13T19:16:42.522+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700700/comment/13934321","id":"13934321","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I agree about the root cause.

A few more thoughts on this patch:\n\n# {{mapred-default.xml}}\n## I think by setting {{mapreduce.shuffle.transferTo.allowed}} to {{true}} in mapred-default.xml, you'll end up getting transferTo turned on in Windows by default.  The value defined in the XML takes precedence over the default in the code.  Instead, if you set the value to nothing/empty string in the XML, then your logic in {{ShuffleHandler}} will select the right value at runtime based on OS.  For an existing example of this, see {{mapreduce.application.classpath}}.\n# {{FadvisedFileRegion}}\n## It appears that {{customShuffleTransfer}} is public only to make it accessible for tests.  Is that correct?  If so, would you please change this to package-private (drop public) and add the {{com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting}} annotation on the method?\n## At the start of {{customShuffleTransfer}}, there is some indentation by 4 spaces in front of the {{throw}} and the {{return 0L;}}.  Would you please change those to 2 spaces?\n## I was a bit confused by this logic:\n{code}\n      //adjust counters and buffer limit\n      if(readSize < trans) {\n        trans -= readSize;\n        position += readSize;\n        byteBuffer.flip();\n      } else {\n        byteBuffer.limit((int)trans);\n        byteBuffer.position(0);\n        position += trans; \n        trans = 0;\n      }\n{code}\nI don't understand why we need the conditional.  Looking specifically at the else block, setting limit to current position and setting current position to 0 is the same effect as calling {{Buffer#flip}}.  Updating {{position}} looks unnecessary, because setting {{trans}} to 0 forces this to be the final iteration of the loop.  Overall, it appears that this code could be simplified by dropping the if/else and always running the logic currently in the if block.  What do you think?  Is there some edge case that I'm missing?\n# {{TestFadvisedFileRegion}}\n## There is still a risk of a resource leak in the test, because the {{RandomAccessFile}} constructor can throw an exception.  You could successfully open {{inputFile}}, and then {{targetFile}} fails with an exception, but then {{inputFile}} would never be closed.  I recommend declaring {{inputFile}}, {{targetFile}} and {{target}} outside the try block, initialized to null, and then initialize them first thing inside the try block.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-03-17T18:12:10.884+0000","updated":"2014-03-17T18:12:10.884+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12700700/comment/13945407","id":"13945407","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nikola.vujic","name":"nikola.vujic","key":"nikola.vujic","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nikola Vujic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hi [~cnauroth],\n\nI have applied all fixes except for the if-else in {{FadvisedFileRegion}}. Edge case is reading the last chunk of data from a file. {{customShuffleTransfer}} must read {{actualCount}} bytes from a file, starting from the {{this.position}}. This is done in the while loop and {{trans}} variable is used to calculate the number of remaining bytes. {{fileChannel.read}} returns the number of bytes read. For the last chunk of data this number can be higher than the remaining number of bytes to read. In that case we cannot use {{Buffer#flip}}. \n\nFor example, let's suppose that we have 128 byte buffer and the we want to read 200 bytes starting at position 1000 in a file (file size bigger than 1256 bytes). At least two iterations of the while loop will be done: \n1. Iteration 1: {{fileChannel.read(byteBuffer, 1000+0)}} => 128 bytes are read => all 128 bytes are needed => target.write\n2. Iteration 2: {{fileChannel.read(byteBuffer, 1000+128)}} => 128 bytes are read => 128 bytes are read because file is big enough but only first 72 bytes are needed => {{byteBuffer.limit(72)}} => target.write\n\nIn the else block we don't set limit to the current position but to a number lower than the current position. Updating local {{position}} variable is needed in order to read data starting from a proper position in the next iterations of the loop. Does it make sense?\n\nRegarding the resource leak in the test, I applied a change you suggested and I did the same with the {{fileRegion}} in order to eliminated one try block.\n\nI changed {{customShuffleTransferCornerCases}} to private.
