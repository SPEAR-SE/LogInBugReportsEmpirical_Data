I have my JVM heap size set at 3200 MB, and if I use the popular rule of thumb that io.sort.mb should be ~70% of that, I get 2240 MB.  I rounded this down to 2048 MB, but map tasks crash with :\n{noformat}\njava.io.IOException: Invalid \"io.sort.mb\": 2048\n        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MapTask$MapOutputBuffer.<init>(MapTask.java:790)\n        ...\n{noformat}\n\nMapTask.MapOutputBuffer implements its buffer with a byte[] of size io.sort.mb (in bytes), and is sanity checking the size before allocating the array.  The problem is that Java arrays can't have more than 2^31 - 1 elements (even with a 64-bit JVM), and this is a limitation of the Java language specificiation itself.  As memory and data sizes grow, this would seem to be a crippling limtiation of Java.\n\nIt would be nice if this ceiling were documented, and an error issued sooner, e.g. in jobtracker startup upon reading the config.  Going forward, we may need to implement some array of arrays hack for large buffers.
