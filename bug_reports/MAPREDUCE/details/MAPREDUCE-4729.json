I like how we short circuit the reading of the history file because we know that what we want to read is in a single chunk. However, I am a bit conflicted about where the parsing of the job history file is happening.  I kind of feel that it should go in the recovery service. In this case we are only doing a partial recovery, not a full recovery.  I can see in the future we would want to add in other things to the partial recovery, like when/if we add in a summary of the history file for fast reading it would be nice to propagate that to the next file no matter what happens so that the history server can show a full view of what is happened in the application.  But, I am fine with it the way it is and if you feel strongly the other way feel free to check it in as is +1.

This can be fixed in a separate JIRA if we don't want to fix it here.\n\nCouple of other comments on the patch:\n* Application attempts start from 1 instead of 0, so the first attempt tries to recover AMInfos when it shouldn't and leads to a large FileNotFoundException stacktrace being logged\n* Nit: In RecoveryService.parse there's an extra space logged before a comma.  {{LOG.info(\"Got an error parsing job-history file \"}} should be {{LOG.info(\"Got an error parsing job-history file\"}}\n* Nit: The body of the while loop in readJustAMInfos could be a bit cleaner with fewer conditionals.
