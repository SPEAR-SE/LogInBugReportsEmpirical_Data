It will only add them if they are not immediately under the initial input path.  From the FileInputFormat.listStatus() code:\n\n{code}\n      FileStatus[] matches = fs.globStatus(p, inputFilter);\n      if (matches == null) {\n        errors.add(new IOException(\"Input path does not exist: \" + p));\n      } else if (matches.length == 0) {\n        errors.add(new IOException(\"Input Pattern \" + p + \" matches 0 files\"));\n      } else {\n        for (FileStatus globStat: matches) {\n          if (globStat.isDir()) {\n            for(FileStatus stat: fs.listStatus(globStat.getPath(),\n                inputFilter)) {\n              result.add(stat);\n            }          \n          } else {\n            result.add(globStat);\n          }\n{code}\n\nNote how it blindly just adds all the results of the second-level directory listing to the results rather than recursing the directory handling logic.  That inconsistent directory handling in 1.x seems like a bug to me.  However note that it does not skip any directories -- it either adds the contents of the directory or the directory itself.
