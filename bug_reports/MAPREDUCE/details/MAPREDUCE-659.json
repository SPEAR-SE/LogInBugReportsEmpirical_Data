We could move it to contrib, but we don't have a way to model dependencies between contrib modules. I guess it could go into tools, but that's a stretch. For now, fixing the compilation error seems sufficient.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chris.douglas","name":"chris.douglas","key":"chris.douglas","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Douglas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-07-19T04:24:34.908+0000","updated":"2009-07-19T04:24:34.908+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428765/comment/12735985","id":"12735985","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"created a different target for developers \ndev-build \n\ncd trunk\nant all-jars - this would create all the jars of mapreduce\ncd src/benchmarks/gridmix2\nant dev-build \n\nthis would create the gridmix2 jar.\n\nothers can continue using the same target as before.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-07-28T08:30:18.021+0000","updated":"2009-07-28T08:30:18.021+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428765/comment/12739917","id":"12739917","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this.\nThanks for the comments.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gkesavan","name":"gkesavan","key":"gkesavan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=gkesavan&avatarId=15867"},"displayName":"Giridharan Kesavan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-08-06T06:43:18.623+0000","updated":"2009-08-06T06:43:18.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12428765/comment/12740215","id":"12740215","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudson","name":"hudson","key":"hudson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hudson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #40 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/40/])\n    .
