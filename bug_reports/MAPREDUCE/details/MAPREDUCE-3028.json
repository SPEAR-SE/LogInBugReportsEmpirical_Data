A lesson learned from that is that if the receivers of the call are slow or not avail the push notifications pile up and there is a long delay before they are delivered (at 60 secs HTTP timeout per bad notification, this is a lot in a heavy loaded system). Using a RSS (like) feed the amount of memory used in the JT is about the same (I would think even less) and there is not contention & delay. Plus the fact that more than one party can 'poll' for the status of a job as opposed to a single party 'push'. Using something like size-bound concurrent list to store & serve the job status would not create contention in the JT. Clients could poll often (30 to 60 secs) which seems like a minimal delay.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2011-09-19T15:47:58.228+0000","updated":"2011-09-19T15:47:58.228+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523414/comment/13107931","id":"13107931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"@Alejandro, OK I agree completely that an RSS like feed for reporting which jobs have completed is preferable, so long as we can make it so there is relatively little load on the system even when polling multiple times a second.\n\nBut if we remove the notification all together there may be other applications relying on this functionality that fail.  I would prefer to see both go in, and we deprecate the push.  This would give users time to move off of it.\n\nAlso the delay is not that bad if it is the application master that is sending the notification.  The issue with the delay before was primarily caused by the notification being single threaded.  If one application failed with a 60sec time out then the other notifications started to pile up behind it.  This would still be bad for a map/reduce job to pause 60 seconds for the notification to go through, especially with retry, but it would not impact any other applications not connected to it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2011-09-19T16:03:35.860+0000","updated":"2011-09-19T16:03:35.860+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523414/comment/13107937","id":"13107937","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Yes, makes sense to deprecate but leave the push functionality for a while.\n\nRegarding single-threaded, that was on purpose to avoid using multiple JT threads for this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2011-09-19T16:15:37.505+0000","updated":"2011-09-19T16:15:37.505+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12523414/comment/13129501","id":"13129501","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Ravi, any progress on this?

Please use same config variable names to avoid compatibility.\nIf the name has JT (or jobtracker)then lets discuss. The spec is as such\n\n- AM should trigger a http call upon job completion\n- The http call should be fire and forget by default.\n- If user specifies number of tries then the following should be true\n  1. Allow hadoop config to be set to ignore this in case becomes a problem (too many retries)\n  2. Set max retries for all AM; i.e. users cannot specify a number above this. If Hadoop config does not specify it\nthe value should be 1 (i.e fire and forget)\n  3. Lets say that the Hadoop config on max retries is set to 3. Then AM should try 3 times with timeout (again a\nHadoop variable). If timeout is not specified, the value should be 30 seconds.\n\nThe aim is to let AM get off quickly. Since unlike JT there is one AM per job there would not bottleneck and no hanging\nof queue.

Also it will add in a new delay, and a lot more churn on the Job history server.  Currently the JobHistory server polls HDFS for new jobs that have finished.  If the job has finished it will move it to its own directory, and then cache some info about the app based only on the name of the jhist file.  If we want this to do notification also then we need to either store the URL in the jhist file name, or force the server to read in the config file every time it pulls in a new Application.\n\nI agree that having applications poll for status with something like a very low latency RSS is the preferable solution and as such I would like to see the minimal done to support backwards compatibility, which would be to put the notification in the ApplicationMaster.  But it is Ravi that is doing the fix and if he wants to do more then that and it is not something that is going to cause more problems then it fixes then I would say let him do it.  \n\nWhat I mean by cause more problems then it fixes is that we have had lots of issues in production with having the notification be in a single thread blocking other notifications.  What ever solution it is it cannot allow other notifications to become blocked or severely delayed by a single bad URL.

Even if the name is not that clean it is best to leave it alone.  If you must rename it then @Deprecate the old ones, have them point to the new ones, and then file a JIRA to remove the old ones in a release or two, to give people time to update their code.\n\nThe variables were public but the whole interface is @InterfaceAudience.Private, @InterfaceStability.Evolving . I also couldn't find these variables in 0.20-security (so they were new). Hence removing them should not break binary compatibility.
