It wasn't possible to use only Maven plugins (like maven-antrun-plugin with a <tar> task), because they mishandled permissions and symlinks in the built tarballs.\n\nI tested all of the following build variations:\n\nWindows: mvn -Pnative-win -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package\nMac: mvn -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package\nUbuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package\nUbuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -Drequire.snappy -Dbundle.snappy -Dsnappy.lib=/usr/local/lib -DskipTests clean package\n\nThis works on Windows.  Additionally, on Mac and Ubuntu, I compared the built tarballs from before and after my changes.  I confirmed that the resulting tarballs have exactly the same contents, including permissions and symlinks.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-08T00:14:11.281+0000","updated":"2012-11-08T00:14:11.281+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12615254/comment/13495521","id":"13495521","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raja%40cmbasics.com","name":"raja@cmbasics.com","key":"raja@cmbasics.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042"},"displayName":"Raja Aluri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1 LGTM.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=raja%40cmbasics.com","name":"raja@cmbasics.com","key":"raja@cmbasics.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=raja%40cmbasics.com&avatarId=16042"},"displayName":"Raja Aluri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2012-11-12T19:15:04.033+0000","updated":"2012-11-12T19:15:04.033+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12615254/comment/13495548","id":"13495548","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sureshms","name":"sureshms","key":"sureshms","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10450","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10450","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10450","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10450"},"displayName":"Suresh Srinivas","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"+1.
