I guess the trade-off is between marginal increase in TT code complexity (a timeout check and logging changes) and running multiple attempts of the task. Given the low cost of the fix, I believe we should address this scenario which seems to be far more frequent compared to network partitions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-04-16T00:03:35.934+0000","updated":"2013-04-16T00:03:35.934+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12639500/comment/13632543","id":"13632543","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Trying to understand this, mostly agree with what Arun said. To summarize:\n - Strictly guaranteeing serial execution of task attempts is not possible in general and is a non-requirement\n - JT already deals with all kinds of slow-ness with tasks and irrespective of this patch, clients have to deal with the slowness.\n\nbq. Where possible (i.e., not transient network partitions), run a single task attempt for a task when speculation is turned off\nSeems an arbitrary non-requirement, don't see what we gain from this.\n\nThe JIRA started with the above goal which isn't worth pursing from what I see, but now it seems to have transformed into something more benign. Looked at the patch. It looks like you want quicker failure when tasks are getting launched/localized to meet some kind of SLAs? If that is the case, instead of calling it a 'TT-side implementation', if we call it an aggressive timeout enforced on TTs for tasks, and make it job-configurable, that should do.
