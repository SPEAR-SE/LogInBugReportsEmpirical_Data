This makes the tasks appear to have made more progress than they deserve to have made, in jobs where the input splits are small.\n\nTo make speculation work under pipes with small input splits, two conditions have to be met:\n\n1: The pipes code has to have an API to report progress, and has to use it.  The old patch met this goal.  You incant {{(&context)->serProgress(float)}} within {{HadoopPipes::Mapper.map(HadoopPipes::MapContext& context)}} .  This does require that you have a way of measuring progress,which I consider likely because this is only needed when the input splits are small, which implies that the \"input data\" is really a signal to get the real data somewhere else [or to generate it].\n\n2: The job has to be able to say that the progress that would otherwise be inferred from input split reads has to be ignored.  This newest version of the patch does that; you can either call {{JobConf.setRecordReaderProgressDisabled(true)}}, or set the attribute {{mapred.job.disable.record.reader.progress}} to {{true}} .\n\nThis patch addresses the second point.  I did not mark it available because it needs a forward port.  I attached it to this issue for comments, and for the record.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-22T20:56:43.027+0000","updated":"2010-07-22T20:56:43.027+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437472/comment/12891328","id":"12891328","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"In my previous comment I should have said that this patch addresses BOTH points, and is complete modulo a forward port.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-22T20:58:05.437+0000","updated":"2010-07-22T20:58:05.437+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12437472/comment/12891371","id":"12891371","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dking","name":"dking","key":"dking","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dick King","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I revised the patch to not add an API to read and set set the property that tells MapTask.TrackedRecordReader to not record\nprogress as it reads the input; just read and set the property \"by hand\" in the code.
