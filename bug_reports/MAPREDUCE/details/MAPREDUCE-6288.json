In the patch loadFromHistory tries to grab the job conf from the job history server using a restful API.  Unless things have changed you have no way to know if you have the proper credentials to access an HTTP endpoint, because authentication for HTTP in hadoop, except for web HDFS, is pluggable.  Second on several failures it just logs an INFO or possibly a WARN.  That is not what I would expect if I tried to load a config from the history server and could not. Also the documentation does not indicate any of this.  If you need to get the config from the history server make a new RPC call to do it, because REST is not the correct way.\n\ngetConfPathFromHisotyDir is misspelled. but even the premise of it feels very wrong, except possibly in the case of an admin.  The client should have no knowledge of the internal workings of the history server.  There are defined interfaces, the dropbox directory for finished job history files and the rpc and REST APIs.  If the client assumes that it knows how things are structured we will never be able to maintain backwards compatibility and switch the backend to the timeline server.  What is more the permissions are maintained for the history server, by the history server.  It is the only one that has access to the files, because if anyone could read them that would negate the point of security and ACLs, hence no execute permissions, and if you got past that the files are not world readable for the same reasons.\n\nI have not read the patch in depth, nor the existing code, because it has been too long, but for me personally I would much rather revert  MAPREDUCE-5875 until we have a clean solution that works with security enabled.  A blocker has prescience over a major bug in my opinion, especially when the patch and the current code both ignore some cases where they are unable to load the conf, and just go on.

We should not be exposing an implementation detail like how files are laid out on HDFS in the history server to end users.  If we do expose it we will not be able to change it in the future, like when/if we go to the timeline server.  Also it does not solve the issue for anyone except the original user that launched the MR job.  It will still blow up if another user has permissions, because of Job ACLs, to check the status of the job, but did not launch the job.  There is also technically a race condition here too.  The history server moves the files asynchronously from done_intermediate to done.  You may try to read the file before the history server has finished moving it. There is synchronization within the history server to prevent this from happening if you go through the proper APIs.\n\nIf you want the job conf create a new RPC call for it in the history server and in the MR AM, then have the client download it through those RPC APIs.

It looks like it wasn't supposed to try to access the file directly but rather go through the JHS REST API to get the conf.  Unfortunately that change was inadvertently dropped, but mysteriously that error was never corrected even after it was discovered.\n\nHaving the CLI fall back on the REST API is a lot closer to addressing the concerns Bobby and I had about exposing JHS internals, race conditions, etc.  However I don't think that change alone is sufficient.  Unless I'm missing something, the JHS REST API is not going to allow a JHS delegation token to authenticate.  That's going to break Oozie, since an Oozie launcher only has the delegation token.  I'm OK with the CLI hitting the REST API to get the conf, but only if the REST API supports the same authentication mechanisms that the RPC does today.  I don't believe that's the case.\n\nUnfortunately I don't have time in the short term to address the REST API shortcomings.  If nobody steps up to address this then the simplest path forward is to revert MAPREDUCE-5875 from branch-2 and trunk until someone can properly fix it.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2017-03-31T17:56:25.827+0000","updated":"2017-03-31T17:56:25.827+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12785022/comment/16037665","id":"16037665","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jianhe","name":"jianhe","key":"jianhe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jian He","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"[~rkanter], your last comment mentioned it is already reverted.\nBut I still see it in branch-2 and trunk.\nThere's one revert commit in branch-2 and trunk, but the content of that only changed  the CHANGEST.txt.
