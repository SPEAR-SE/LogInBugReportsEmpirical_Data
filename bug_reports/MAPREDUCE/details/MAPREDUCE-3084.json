From an initial look at the patch, seems like both cases will be handled with the changes (will continue looking).\nOne case that could be problematic is if there's multiple threads in the AsyncDispatcher - 1 per event type - that could still lead to a race between CE.cancelOrSendSignal and CE.launchContainer (similar stuff likely exists elsewhere also).\nVinod had an alternate suggestion - by using additional states and moving the START_CONTAINER localization to an alternate state.\nWould it be simpler fixing this by just using interrupts ? (Shell does currently ignore interrupts in some cases though)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sseth","name":"sseth","key":"sseth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Siddharth Seth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-12T06:54:16.233+0000","updated":"2011-10-12T06:54:16.233+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12524497/comment/13134690","id":"13134690","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hitesh","name":"hitesh","key":"hitesh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hitesh Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Being addressed as part of MR-3240.
