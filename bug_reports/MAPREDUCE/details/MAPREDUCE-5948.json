There's a relatively straightforward testcase that demonstrates the issue.

I believe that will lead to duplicate records rather than dropped records (e.g.: split ends exactly when a delimiter ends, and both splits end up processing the record after that delimiter).\n\nInstead we can get correct behavior by treating any split in the middle of a multibyte custom delimiter as if the delimiter ended exactly at the end of the split, i.e.: the consumer of the prior split is responsible for processing the divided delimiter and the subsequent record.  The consumer of the next split then tosses the first record up to the first full delimiter as usual (i.e.: including the partial delimiter at the beginning of the split) and proceeds to process any subsequent records.  That way we don't get any dropped records or duplicate records.\n\nI think one way of accomplishing this is to have the LineReader for multibyte custom delimiters report the current position as the end of the record data *without* the delimiter bytes.  Then any record that ends exactly at the end of the split or whose delimiter straddles the split boundary will cause the prior split to consume the extra record necessary.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-11-19T17:43:49.414+0000","updated":"2013-11-19T17:43:49.414+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/13826829","id":"13826829","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Raising severity since this involves loss of data.

I think this approach can work when the input is uncompressed, however I don't think it will work for block-compressed inputs.  Block codecs often report the file position as being the start of the codec block and then it \"teleports\" to the byte position of the next block once the first byte of the next block is consumed.  See HADOOP-9622 for a similar issue with the default delimiter and how it's being addressed.  Also getFilePosition() for a compressed input is returning a compressed stream offset, so if we try to do math on that with an uncompressed delimiter length we're mixing different units.\n\nSince LineRecordReader::getFilePosition() can mean different things for different inputs, I think a better approach would be to change LineReader (not LineRecordReader) so the reported file position for multi-byte custom delimiters is the file position after the record but not including its delimiter.  Either that or wait for HADOOP-9622 to be committed and  update the SplitLineReader interface from the HADOOP-9622 patch so the uncompressed input reader would indicate an additional record needs to be read if the split ends mid-delimiter.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-11-20T16:05:55.742+0000","updated":"2013-11-20T16:05:55.742+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/13828453","id":"13828453","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks Jason, I prefer waiting for HADOOP-9622 to be committed. \nMeanwhile I will try to update SplitLineReader offline.

Comments:\n\n* I don't think LineReader is the best place to put split-specific code.  Its sole purpose is to read lines from an input stream regardless of split boundaries.  There are users of this class that are not necessarily processing splits.  That's why I created SplitLineReader in MapReduce, and I believe this logic is better placed there.\n* I don't think we want to change Math.max(maxBytesToConsume(pos), maxLineLength)) to Math.min(maxBytesToConsume(pos), maxLineLength)).  We need to be able to read a record past the end of the split when the record crosses the split boundary, but I think this change could allow a truncated record to be returned for an uncompressed input stream. e.g.: fillBuffer happens to return data only up to the end of the split, record is incomplete (no delimiter found), but maxBytesToConsume keeps us from filling the buffer with more data and a truncated record is returned.\n\nI think a more straightforward approach would be to have SplitLineReader be aware of the end of the split and track it in fillBuffer() much like CompressedLineSplitReader does.  The fillBuffer callback already indicates whether we're mid-delimiter or not, so we can simply check if fillBuffer is being called after the split has ended but we're mid-delimiter.  In that case we need an additional record.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-12-10T17:13:49.957+0000","updated":"2013-12-10T17:13:49.957+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/13913017","id":"13913017","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Hi jason\nI was trying to implement the proposed solution you suggested. \nBut I was facing issues. \nIf you know the exact changes, can you please provide the patch.\nThanks","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2014-02-26T15:29:50.373+0000","updated":"2014-02-26T15:29:50.373+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/14043474","id":"14043474","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I am tracking this jira for a while.\nI read all the comments by Jason.\nI guess this patch will address the Jason's comments.\nI have used the test case provided in Vinayakumar's patch and modified a little bit to test exhaustively.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=shahrs87","name":"shahrs87","key":"shahrs87","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rushabh S Shah","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-06-25T13:57:51.821+0000","updated":"2014-06-25T13:57:51.821+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/14043559","id":"14043559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

The original problem reported in the JIRA has to do with records being dropped with uncompressed inputs.  We should fix that issue so we don't drop data when using an uncompressed input.  I'm assuming Rushabh's patch solves that issue, but I haven't looked at it in detail just yet.\n\nThere's another issue related to mistaken record delimiter recognition where the subsequent split reader can accidentally think it found a delimiter when in fact the real record delimiter is somewhere else. If the subsequent split reader sees 'xxxxyzxxx' at the beginning of its split then it will toss out the first record (i.e.: the first 'xxx') then read 'xyz' as the next record.  However that may or may not be the correct behavior, because with that kind of delimiter and data the correct behavior depends upon the _previous_ split's data.  If the previous split ended with 'abc' then the behavior was correct and there are two records in the stream: 'abc' and 'xyz'.  If the previous split ended with 'abcx' then that's the incorrect behavior.  The records should be 'abc' and 'xxyz' but the second split reader will report an 'xyz' record that shouldn't exist.\n\nTo solve that problem either a split reader would have to examine the prior-split's data to distinguish this case, or the split reader would have to realize it's an ambiguous situation and leave the record processing to the previous split reader to handle.  The former can be very expensive if the prior split is compressed, as it has to potentially unpack the entire split.  Also this can get very tricky and a reader may need to read more than one other split to resolve it.  For example, if the data stream is 'axxxxxxxxxxxxx......xxxxxxbxxxxxx......xxxxxcxxxxxx' then a reader may have to scan far down into subsequent splits since only it knows where the true record boundaries are.  Simply tacking on an extra character at the beginning of that input changes where the record boundaries are and the record contents even the last split in the input.  Solving this requires a different high-level algorithm to split processing than what we have today (i.e.: throw away the first record and go), so I believe that's something better left to a followup JIRA.\n\nIt'd be nice to solve the dropped-record problem for scenarios where we don't have to worry about mistaken record delimiter recognition in the data, as that's an incremental improvement from where we are today.  I'll try to get some time to review the latest patch and provide comments soon.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-06-27T16:52:45.506+0000","updated":"2014-06-27T16:52:45.506+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/14046456","id":"14046456","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Thanks for the patch, Rushabh.  Some comments on the patch:\n\n* LineReader: I'm not sure changing LineReader's byteConsumed semantics will be OK.  LineReader is used by things besides MapReduce, so changing the return result for some corner cases may be problematic for other downstream projects.  Rather than rely on the bytes consumed result from LineReader it seems we could track this using the existing totalBytesRead value.  We simply need to track how many bytes from the input stream we've read before we try to read the next line.  If we've read past the end of the split (i.e.: bytes > split length) then we can set the finished flag.\n* UncompressedSplitLineReader: Given how complicated split processing can be and all the corner cases, it'd be nice to have some comments explaining what's going on similar to what's in CompressedSplitLineReader.  Otherwise many will wonder why we're going out of our way to make sure we stop right at the split when we fill the buffer, etc.\n* bufferPosition is not really a position in the buffer but a position within the split, and that's similar to totalBytesRead.  I'm not sure we can completely combine them, but it'd be nice if their names were more specific to what they're tracking (one is the total bytes read from the input stream and another is total bytes consumed by the line reader).\n* {{(inDelimiter && actualBytesRead > 0)}} can just be {{(inDelimiter)}} because we already know actualBytesRead > 0 at that point due to the previous condition check.\n* Test doesn't cleanup the temporary files it creates when it's done.  (Actually just noticed the tests are creating files in the wrong directory, should be something like TestLineRecordReader.class.getName() and not TestTextInputFormat.)\n* Nit: whitespace between {{if}} and ( and lines formatted to 80 columns to follow the coding standard\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-06-27T22:27:02.196+0000","updated":"2014-06-27T22:27:02.196+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12663407/comment/14047405","id":"14047405","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinayrpet","name":"vinayrpet","key":"vinayrpet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinayakumar B","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"Thanks Jason for the detail in prev comment.
