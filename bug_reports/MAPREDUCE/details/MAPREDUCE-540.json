Or, if there's a way to make getTotalSlots non-synchronized or cache its result, we should do that, as there is no reason to call this method all the time.\n\nIncidentally, if we change the fair scheduler logic to not use deficits anymore (which I'm proposing in HADOOP-4803 and seems like a better idea the more I think of it), the update thread could start running much less frequently. The reason it runs so often now is to make the deficit computations accurate so that we don't have too many tasks per job starting/finishing in-between update calls. If we removed deficits, I think the main reason we'd need periodic updates will be preemption, and that check can happen much less frequently.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matei","name":"matei","key":"matei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matei Zaharia","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-02-09T07:32:50.036+0000","updated":"2009-02-09T07:32:50.036+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12414195/comment/12672506","id":"12672506","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Agree Matei.
