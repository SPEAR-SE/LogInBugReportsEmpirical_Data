This would work if the job is alone in the cluster. Once we have queues, the headroom calculation becomes more complicated and it would require a separate headroom calculation per queue/job.\n\nSo, as a result headroom variable is kind of given up currently: *headroom is always set to 0* What this implies to the speculation is that speculation becomes very aggressive, not considering whether there is enough space for the mappers or not.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12651278","id":"12651278","filename":"MAPREDUCE-5844.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam

(e.g.: think of a scenario where all the other jobs taking up resources are long-running and won't release resources anytime soon)\n\nIf you are seeing cases where reducers are shot then immediately relaunched along with the failed maps then that implies that either the headroom calculation is wrong or resources happened to be freed right at the time the new containers were requested.  Note that there are a number of issues with headroom calculations, see YARN-1198 and related JIRAs.\n\nAssuming those are fixed, there might be some usefulness to a grace period where we wait for other apps to free up resources in the queue to avoid shooting reducers.  A proper value for that probably depends upon how much work would be lost by the reducers in question, how long we can tolerate waiting to try to preserve that work, and how likely it is that another app will free up resources anytime soon.  If we wait and still don't get our resources then that's purely worse than a job that took decisive action as soon as a map retroactively failed and there's no more space left in the queue.   Also if the headroom is zero because a single job has hit user limits within the queue then waiting serves no purpose -- it has to shoot a reducer in that case to make progress.  In that latter case we'd need additional information in the allocate response from the scheduler to know that waiting for resources to be released from other applications in the queue isn't going to work.\n\nIt would be good to verify from the RM logs what is happening in your case.  If the headroom calculation is wrong then we should fix that, otherwise if resources are churning quickly then a grace period before preempting reducers may make sense.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-04-17T19:49:13.319+0000","updated":"2014-04-17T19:49:13.319+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709096/comment/13973430","id":"13973430","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks [~jlowe] for your detailed comment.\n\n# As I explained in the description of the jira the printed headroom in the logs is always zero. e.g.,\n{code}\norg.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.rm.RMContainerRequestor: getResources() for application_x: ask=8 release= 0 newContainers=0 finishedContainers=0 resourcelimit=<memory:0, vCores:0> knownNMs=x\n{code}\nAnd this is not because there is no headroom (I know that by checking the available resources when job was running).\n# I actually was not surprised by headroom set always to zero since I found the the headroom field being abandoned in the source code of fairscheduler: in SchedulerApplicationAttempt#getHeadroom() is the one with which the headroom field in the response is set, while SchedulerApplicationAttempt#setHeadroom() is never invoked in FairScheduler (it is invoked in capacity and fifo scheduler though)\n# I assumed that not invoking setHeadroom in fair scheduler was intentional perhaps due to complications of computing the headroom when fair share is taken into account.

I guess there is no unanimity about the default value of the threshold, as some also suggested to have its default equal to zero. We are planning to have it enabled in our config settings anyway, but I let the community decide on the default value in the source code.\n\nI think using the timestamp of the last allocated mapper is interesting since we would keep only one timestamp versus one per mapper request. The challenge however would be that it does not clarify how recent is each map request. We can of course have another single timestamp for earliest received map request but maintaining it after one of the many inflight map requests get allocated would add a bit of more complexity to the patch and its logic. I figured having the logic in the patch as simple as possible would justify a new timestamp field per container request.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-28T16:06:22.395+0000","updated":"2014-05-28T16:06:22.395+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709096/comment/14027096","id":"14027096","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Current patch looks reasonable to me.

About the unit test, I looked into it and it seems to be non-trivial to me: On one hand preemptReducesIfNeeded uses local fields and is not feasible to be tested separately via mocking. The alternative would be to test the entire RMContainerAllocator object; however to make sure that preemptReducesIfNeeded is exercised in the test RMContainerAllocator object should be fed with a complicated set of events: some mappers are not finished, but enough are finished to trigger reducer start, and finally mapper failure. The complexity of the unit test in this way would much more than that of the minor change introduced by the patch. I guess it would be possible to come up with unit tests with reasonable complexity if we make changes into the RMContainerAllocator to make it more testable, but I am not sure whether such changes are desirable as part of this jira.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-06-10T22:13:47.402+0000","updated":"2014-06-10T22:13:47.402+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709096/comment/14027130","id":"14027130","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kkambatl","name":"kkambatl","key":"kkambatl","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Karthik Kambatla","active":false,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"This is new functionality and we should definitely try to add unit tests.

It might be an inconsistency issue of git with \"patch -p0\".","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maysamyabandeh","name":"maysamyabandeh","key":"maysamyabandeh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=maysamyabandeh&avatarId=17671"},"displayName":"Maysam Yabandeh","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-06-18T21:21:42.206+0000","updated":"2014-06-18T21:21:42.206+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709096/comment/14036498","id":"14036498","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
