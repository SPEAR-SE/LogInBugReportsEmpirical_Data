This would cause some unexpected behavior. For instance, if I specify \"A=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:xxx\", A would be shown as \":xxx\", while if I specify \"LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$Z:xxx,Z=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:yyy\", Z would be come the actual value of LD_LIBRARY_PATH + \":yyy\" (and LD_LIBRARY_PATH is not affected at all).
