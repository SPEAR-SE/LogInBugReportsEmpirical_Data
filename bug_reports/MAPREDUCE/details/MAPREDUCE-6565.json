The security token design using toke + service name does not have updates to accommodate the complex network setup. HA This quick fix just get by with executing mapreduce jobs. However, I would suggest to create a new request to address the multi-home network and token handling in a more organized effort. Security package has very succinct log and it took me quite while to track down the issue.

I think MR over distributed cache shouldn't load configurations that included in MR tar ball. \n\nWe explicitly have MapReduce load configurations that are in the tarball.  We used to run without that and had the jobs pick up the configurations from the node, but we often ran into cases where rolling upgrades broke jobs on the cluster (e.g.: config changes to reference a plugin class that only exists in the new release, or old config setting breaks job running new release, etc.).  Things got a lot simpler for us when we put the configs in the MR tarball and made sure those configs reflect the entire cluster.  Added bonus: we don't need to push new confs to every node when the conf changes are just client-side (i.e.: not for the datanode/nodemanager).  We just update our tarball in HDFS and every new job picks up the change.\n\nBack to the original reported issue: one reason not all security settings in job.xml aren't honored is because, unlike the *-site.xml files, job.xml is not added as a default Configuration resource.  That means anything that simply instantiates a Configuration instance (e.g.: SecurityUtil, etc.) will not \"see\" job.xml settings.  I'm not sure why job.xml wasn't added as a default resource.  That may have been an intentional omission to avoid some problem, but part of me wonders if it should have been setup so that all Configuration objects start using job.xml settings if job.xml applies (i.e: we're using JobConf).\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-11-15T21:41:21.487+0000","updated":"2016-11-15T21:41:21.487+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12919143/comment/15669320","id":"15669320","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"[~jlowe], thanks for your comments!

If so, this actually belongs to a server-side setting, even it take effective in our current client side code.\n\nIn practice that's essentially how it works in our setup.  Since this property is currently not read from job.xml, it ends up using whatever is in the core-site.xml that's in the MR tarball.  The MR tarball is created by the cluster admins and so the confs are consistent with the server settings for that cluster.  A user could try overriding this property in their job.xml, but it wouldn't be used because job.xml is ignored for this specific config.  (Yes, a user could provide their own, custom tarball with custom site files to override this setting, but they need to know what they're doing if they choose not to use the default MR tarball provided by the cluster admins.)\n\nGiven this is a client-side setting that must be in sync with the server-side setting it'd be nice if this wasn't possible to get out-of-sync.  For example, the server that granted the token could also communicate which setting must be used by the client later when the token is used, but that's a significant change with backward compatibility concerns.  Of course there's also backwards compatibility concerns with adding job.xml as a default resource so that this property could be fetched from there instead of core-site.xml or core-default.xml.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-11-16T14:34:38.903+0000","updated":"2016-11-16T14:34:38.903+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12919143/comment/15672159","id":"15672159","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq. job.xml does override the tarball configs in almost every way except this security setting because of the way that setting is loaded\nTo me this pretty much reveals the nature of a bug.

Essentially what we're asking is whether clients should be able to override any non-final setting in the *-site.xml files with their job.xml setting, even if that setting is a \"server side\" property\nAgree. Whether clients are allowed to override any non-final setting is something I originally asking for. But later, I realized that if we disallow client to override \"server-setting\" - like case here, tar-ball configuration will become the final setting for \"server-side\" configuration. It also means MR tarball will become various according to cluster settings but not according to releases. Standing at support-ability prospective, we don't want our users to touch tarball settings because it is hard to control/monitor these settings by Ambari or other tools. Otherwise, we have to dig into tarball settings when weird things happens. In this sense, I think it could be simpler if we don't differentiate client-side and server-side setting in configuration loading. \n\nbq. The risk of this change is when the client's *-site.xml files do not match what should be there. For the \"server side\" settings this has been working because we've been ignoring job.xml for those.

I don't know offhand how many other properties besides this one could suddenly change because we start using the client's version of the property in job.xml when we didn't before.\nI think even before, our configuration loading doesn't guarantee we only loading client-side configuration rather than server-side configuration. Even for mapred-site.xml, there are history server related settings that belongs to server-side but you can override a different value in client side which just doesn't work though. So we still need to rely on code logic to bypass what settings belongs to server-setting in client side. Also, better documentation could be helpful for user to differentiate what's client-side and what's server-side. Our current tricky loading mechanism won't help on both side.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djp","name":"djp","key":"djp","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=djp&avatarId=16954"},"displayName":"Junping Du","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2016-11-18T19:53:52.106+0000","updated":"2016-11-18T19:53:52.106+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12919143/comment/15677831","id":"15677831","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I'm +1 for making all client-side settings override anything in any site file that isn't marked final for 3.x.  I'm a bit hesitant for 2.x given the long-standing semantics for some of these properties, and in any case there needs to be a clear release note explaining to users what to expect with the change.\n\nHmm, there might be a problem with adding job.xml as a default resource, and that has to do with relative ordering of when job.xml is added and other default resources like the *-site.xml files are added.  The various site.xml files are only added as defaults when the related classes are loaded (e.g.: HdfsConfiguration, YarnConfiguration, JobConf, etc.)  If we add job.xml as a default resource _before_ some of these classes are touched then some site files will override the job.xml files because they'll be loaded later.  We can probably get the ordering right for all the site files provided by core Hadoop, but I'm worried about downstream projects that may have their own site files (e.g.: hive-site.xml).  Client-side settings could be smashed by site settings if the ordering is not correct.  job.xml would need to be the last default resource added, and we may not be able to guarantee that with arbitrary downstream code.\n\nUnfortunately without using the default resource feature of Configuration, I don't know of a straightforward way to get classes using plain ol' Configuration instances to see values set in job.xml.  Any ideas here?  We can fix individual instances like hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip in case-specific ways (i.e.: calling the SecurityUtil.setTokenServiceUseIp method for this property), but not all cases will have a straightforward fix.  And we'd have to track them all down individually.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2016-11-18T21:39:50.032+0000","updated":"2016-11-18T21:39:50.032+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12919143/comment/15691607","id":"15691607","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtCarrera9","name":"gtCarrera9","key":"gtcarrera9","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Li Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"A quick patch to solely resolve the use_ip issue.
