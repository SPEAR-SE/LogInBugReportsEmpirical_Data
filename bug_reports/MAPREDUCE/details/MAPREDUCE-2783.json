No unit test is feasable.\n\nManual tests were as follows:\n\n1) Start task (wordcount) and kill -9 MRAppMaster. Result is that scheduler UI shows 'UNASSIGNED' in 'Tracking UI' column. 'UNASSIGNED' is not a stale link.\n2) Start task (wordcount) and kill using 'bin/mapred job kill'. Scheduler UI shows 'History' in 'Tracking UI' column. 'History' is a link to the job history page for the killed job.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eepayne","name":"eepayne","key":"eepayne","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10444","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10444","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10444","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10444"},"displayName":"Eric Payne","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-10-06T22:18:43.149+0000","updated":"2011-10-06T22:18:43.149+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518053/comment/13122653","id":"13122653","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"The bug related to absent history files for killed jobs got fixed via one of the other patches.\n\nI also manually verified the above behaviour on my single node setup.\n\nThe fix for the corner case looks good. +1.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-10-07T09:16:46.947+0000","updated":"2011-10-07T09:16:46.947+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518053/comment/13122659","id":"13122659","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vinodkv","name":"vinodkv","key":"vinodkv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Vinod Kumar Vavilapalli","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.
