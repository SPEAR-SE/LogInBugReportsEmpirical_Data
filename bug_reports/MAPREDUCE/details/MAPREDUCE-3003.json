But it's actually far less error prone than the versions plugin (see below).\n\nbq. Besides, this the pros you mention for this approach are easily doable using the version plugin (as it is done today for all the non MR modules).\n\nNo, the pros of approach #1 cannot be duplicated with versions plugin. With approach #1, I can define multiple profiles in settings.xml and easily switch select an arbitrary version combination with custom profiles in a drop down menu in an IDE. And it works consistently across *all* downstream projects, simultaneously. You can never do that with the versions plugin.\n\nbq. #2 is the right way of doing things in Maven, it is easy, straight forward and any developer familiar with Maven (or learning) will understand what is going on.\n\nNo, pom version handling is still an open issue in Maven (cf. MNG-624, MNG-2971). Do you know how many versions:set command lines and in which directories, in order to change the project version just for hadoop-common? Please actually try it before saying that it's easy. The versions plugin is not an official maven plugin, it's a codehaus plugin to workaround the current indecision of maven pom version resolution. It's one of those most unmaven like plugins that mutates POM sources and doesn't work with profiles.\n\nIMO, the current maven implementation (up to 3.x) is confused/conflated about dependency and build specifications. It should really have the concept of *published* artifacts, where the (parent) version is automatically baked, for coding signing, install and deploy.\n\nbq. I was doing 'mvn install' from trunk/ today and the MR POMs are un-usable.\n\nmvn install should install working (with versions interpolated) poms in your .m2 repository, unless someone borked one of the pom.xmls in the recent flurry of commits, while I wasn't looking :) Please show me an actual broken pom from .m2/repository. It should be trivial to fix.\n\nThat said, I can overlook the inconvenience of approach #2 for my working environment and adopt the versions plugin mostly because I don't want see the bogus warnings from maven 3.0.x :). I'm not gonna -1 on approach 2, as long as versions:set only needs to be done once (instead of multiple times in in different directories) to switch versions.\n\n ","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-16T06:29:18.968+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T06:29:18.968+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522963/comment/13105927","id":"13105927","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"Maven as its problems, many of them, agree (I say we moved from ant/poison-ivy hell to maven hell, still we are better off, a few circles lower which actually means higher, or the other way around). \n\nStill, I'd try to do as vanilla maven as possible.

Furthermore, if sanitation would have happened, I probably would have gone nuts looking where that POM came from because I didn't know about sanitation (granted, now I know, but a new developer won't).\n\nThose are my concern against #1.\n\nNow, going to #2, it is possible to update all the POMs in one shot if the POMs are crafted following a rule that is considered good practice in multi-module Maven, to have a common parent pom for all the modules in your project.\n\nFor example, if you run the following command:\n\n{code}\n$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.24.1-SNAPSHOT -f hadoop-project/pom.xml \n{code}\n\nYou'll get all common/hdfs modules updated correctly to the new version in one shot.\n\n*-f* is used to point to the common parent POM, the project POM.\n\nWhen we normalize all the MR modules, the 'versions:set' would work for all.\n\nI'm not saying that 'versions:set' is the solution to all our versioning handling, but seems to do what we need without doing something a bit unconventional and not expected.\n\nIs this example using the 'versions' plugin to update all the modules in one shot what you refer as 'only needs to be done once ...'?\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2011-09-16T07:42:09.261+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T07:42:09.261+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522963/comment/13106597","id":"13106597","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"A comment on the latest patch, it is a Maven good practice (also an issue of eternal discussions in Mavenland) that children have their version explictly, not only getting them from the parent (giving that we have a plugin to update versions this is not complicates things).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"created":"2011-09-16T17:02:40.444+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T17:02:40.444+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522963/comment/13106614","id":"13106614","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"-1 overall.

You keep talking about the \"vanilla maven\" way without any references, especially in light of the history maven that they did attempt interpolation in 2.0.9 then backed out in 2.0.10 because it was half baked. I'd appreciate that you have references (like I did) to back your assertions up. The pom version resolution is mess in the current maven, and the approach #1 is the most convenient to developers for large scale projects. BTW, you forgot the top-level pom, which needs another command. The top-level aggregation pom also needs to inherit from the hadoop-project/pom.xml, in order to have a single command to switch project versions.\n\nbq. When we normalize all the MR modules, the 'versions:set' would work for all.\n\nThat was my point, it's more complicated than you think and your latest patch doesn't work that way. I'm fine with approach #2, as long as it's made to work reasonably well, the current patch doesn't.\n\nbq. A comment on the latest patch, it is a Maven good practice (also an issue of eternal discussions in Mavenland) that children have their version explictly, not only getting them from the parent.\n\nAgain, citation needed. You can't just make up a \"maven good practice\" on the spot, given MNG-624 is still an open issue. Aesthetically speaking, the duplicated version clauses are redundant and pollute the diff views even more, which is already the biggest downside of versions:set.\n\nThe bottom line is that the current patch does *not* work, you need more changes (fix the properties references as well as the inheritance change) to make the version switch tolerable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vicaya","name":"vicaya","key":"vicaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Luke Lu","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-16T18:09:57.609+0000","updated":"2011-09-16T18:09:57.609+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12522963/comment/13106733","id":"13106733","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"This JIRA on its own does not get 'versions:set' to work.\n\nBefore I've described how #2 works with hadoop-project/hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs modules with one command (as you've asked as precondition to be OK with option #2).\n\nFurther changes are required to get all Hadoop POMs to work in one go with 'versions:set'.
