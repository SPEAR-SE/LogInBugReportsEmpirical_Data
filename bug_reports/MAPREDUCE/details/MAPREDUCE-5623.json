Java's loaders' threads initializes jobCounters. Initialized jobCounters can be seen from a thread which initializes jobCounters.\n2. MRClientService#getCounters is called, but it's not a initialization thread. Therefore, it can return null and the RPC returns null.\n\nYour point is that 1. of my thought is wrong and initialized values are barriered after creating its instances. I cannot say which is correct because I cannot find documents about initialization sequence of Java instances. My thought was wrong?\n\nOr, I've noticed that Job#getCounters() can return null in some cases:\n{code}\n  /**\n   * Gets the counters for this job.

Or, I've noticed that Job#getCounters() can return null in some cases\n\nI think that's much more likely to be the case of what's happening here.  It's not like the JobImpl was just created at the time we're trying to get the counters for it, as we're waiting for job completion before attempting to get them.\n\nUnfortunately I can't reproduce the issue locally to dig deeper.  I think knowing what the AM logs looked like for the job and whether the client was redirected to the history server before the null counters could shed a lot of light on the problem.  If the client was redirected, examining the .jhist file would also be interesting.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-11-22T14:18:26.623+0000","updated":"2013-11-22T14:18:26.623+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12678998/comment/13845028","id":"13845028","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=liangly","name":"liangly","key":"liangly","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=liangly&avatarId=10105","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=liangly&avatarId=10105","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=liangly&avatarId=10105","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=liangly&avatarId=10105"},"displayName":"Liyin Liang","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Hong_Kong"},"body":"Hi Jason Lowe，\nIf the client was redirected to the history server, job.getCounters() will return null.
