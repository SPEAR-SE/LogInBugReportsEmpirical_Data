I first investigating just having the job send the kill event when it transitioned to the ERROR state but it sends a kill event to each task, which then each task has to send a kill event to the task attempt, and then the task attempt send an event to the container launcher to tell the node manager to kill the container.  That is a lot to do and I don't want to have the job wait for that to happen since its an error state. If you don't wait, then you have a race as to whether everything is actually processed. The other issue with sending events is that the final jobfinish event is handled by the same async dispatcher so it will be busy finishing/shutting down and won't process any further events. So it seems it has to be done by a service during the stop call. The container launcher already knows what containers it has that aren't complete so I chose to have the container launcher kill any containers that haven't completed when its stop routine is called.  The bad part is the container launcher didn't have all the information required to actually kill the container so I had to add it, which I'm not completely happy with but seemed the best fit.  \n\nI will attach a patch shortly.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-04-27T19:23:09.823+0000","updated":"2012-04-27T19:23:09.823+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12550842/comment/13263909","id":"13263909","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I also manually tested this.

Since the RM was down and the AM went away there was no one to tell the NM to kill it. The thing that might make sense is to have the NM kill any containers when it is gracefully shutting down and when its starting up (in case of the crash case).  It might not make sense for it to just kill the containers immediately since those containers could be running and finish just fine. When its shutting down its a bit easier since it knows what containers are running, the starting up is a bit harder since the NM then needs to know exactly what was running before it shut down and make sure it doesn't kill something it shouldn't.   In this particular case when the RM comes back up, it tells the NM to reboot so it would kill the containers at that point.\n\nI think its a bit more of a corner case because normally the AM would have killed the task or the task would have finished normally. But I will file the jiras for those.  Let me know if you have additional thoughts.\n\nI originally had a check in kill() to make sure it wasn't done but had somehow thought it wasn't needed, perhaps I misread something, will look again. \n\nI will make the other changes.
