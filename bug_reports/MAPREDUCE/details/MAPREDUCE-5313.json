This can affect job balance, since one map job is now twice as big as the others.\n\nIn \"src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/LineRecordReader.java\", line 110, there is a comment about skipping the first line of the input file by default, since \"next()\" reads two lines anyway. This was not the behavior in 0.20.2, which did not have this problem.\n\nSeems perhaps related to :\n\n\"HADOOP-4010. Change semantics for LineRecordReader to read an additional\n    line per split- rather than moving back one character in the stream- to\n    work with splittable compression codecs. (Abdul Qadeer via cdouglas)\"\n\nIt seems this was not implemented properly and is leading to the issue described above in the situation that the input file is text.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"332559","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JobTracker Creates Empty Mapper Task, and a Mapper Task with 2 FileSplits.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=noelcodella","name":"noelcodella","key":"noelcodella","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Noel C.
