The individual tasks have a large initial overhead when they load cached data. Using the JVM reuse option ({{mapred.job.reuse.jvm.num.tasks}}) and by caching data in a static variable we can reduce the overhead. \n\nThe current {{JvmManager}} implementation will prefer creating new JVMs to reusing existing ones if the number of already created JVMs is less than the maximum. In the extreme case where the capacity scheduler is used to limit the number of tasks on a node to 1, but the number of [map|reduce] tasks per node is set to say 16, then 16 JVMs will be created before one of them is reused. Obviously, if the amount of cached data in the memory of each JVM is large, then node can rapidly run out of memory! What should really happen in this case is that the first created JVM should be reused, and others should not be spawned.\n\nTo work-around this problem on our cluster, we have modified the logic in the {{reapJVM()}} method in {{JvmManager}} to prefer to reuse an existing JVM (idle & belonging to the same job) over starting a new JVM, or killing an existing idle JVM.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"0h","remainingEstimate":"0h","originalEstimateSeconds":0,"remainingEstimateSeconds":0},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12493818","id":"12493818","filename":"hadoop-patch.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jonhare","name":"jonhare","key":"jonhare","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jonathon
