Since there were still mapper tasks not yet assigned any slot, the map phase never completed.\n5. The system entered a deadlock state where reducers occupy all available slots, but are waiting for mappers to be complete; mappers cannot move forward because of no slot available.\n\nThe workaround in our system was to set \nmapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps=1 and the issue was no longer seen.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12310320":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"4101","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Job can get stuck in a deadlock between mappers and reducers for low values of mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps (<<1)","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rjain7","name":"rjain7","key":"rjain7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rjain7","name":"rjain7","key":"rjain7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603669/comment/13435848","id":"13435848","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nemon","name":"nemon","key":"nemon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931"},"displayName":"Nemon Lou","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"body":"Do you use the FIFO scheduler?\nIf so ,have a look at MAPREDUCE-4299","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=nemon","name":"nemon","key":"nemon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=nemon&avatarId=22931"},"displayName":"Nemon Lou","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Shanghai"},"created":"2012-08-16T08:49:00.734+0000","updated":"2012-08-16T08:49:00.734+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603669/comment/13469511","id":"13469511","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rjain7","name":"rjain7","key":"rjain7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rahul Jain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Yes, this issue was found in FIFO scheduler;
