This would make sure that we do not reserve more than required.\n   JobInProgress maintains the list of TTs reserved for map and reduce, we can use the same , TT removed will just be first element in the list.\n\n The above solution has a small starvation issue incase of speculative tasks.That is because speculative tasks cannot run on certain kind of TTs. For example:\n There is a job with 3 tips namely tip1 , tip2 , tip3.\n for attempt tip1_1 we have reserved TT1.\n for attempt tip2_1 we have reserved TT2.\n for attempt tip3_1 we have reserved TT3.\nIn the above case if tip1_1 is assigned to TT4 then we simply unreserve TT1 as it is at the top of list. Now if there is second attempt\ntip1_2 for tip1 , and if it cannot run on TT2 or TT3, there can be slight starvation for tip1_2 as it has to wait till it gets a TT where it could \nrun.But this is kind of ok , as this is comparatively remote case and list of TTs is a dynamic structure. In order to make above work correctly we would need attempt id , reserved tt mapping(Any other suggestions?) . This would require some significant changes.\n\nThe above approach would also make sure that code changes are simple and straight forward . It definitly alleviate the current situation, where chances of going overboard with reservation is relatively higher.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rksingh","name":"rksingh","key":"rksingh","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"rahul k singh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-11-30T15:41:18.682+0000","updated":"2009-11-30T15:41:18.682+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12430468/comment/14072223","id":"14072223","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"body":"This is likely stale.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aw","name":"aw","key":"aw","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=aw&avatarId=23681"},"displayName":"Allen Wittenauer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2014-07-23T19:50:42.443+0000","updated":"2014-07-23T19:50:42.443+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-763/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0jehr:"}}
