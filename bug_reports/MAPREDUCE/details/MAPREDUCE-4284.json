In a test cluster we can set the property to a relatively high value to be able to inspect container logs/local dirs. But how can we do that in a production cluster. The problem is that any change in this property will affect all jobs, and the change will require restarting all the NodeManagers in the whole cluster. Both consequences are bad, since keeping all dirs for all jobs is expensive from storage perspective and restarting the NMs is expensive from operations perspective.\n\nSo one possible solution is to have the scope of this property as per-job (or add another per-job property). so the user can set this value to give a hint to the NM to keep the dirs for this individual job.

I think it's not just the tasklogs and this is why this property exists. We have seen cases where inspecting the contents of the containers' localized file directories and log directories were extremely useful in troubleshooting problems (e.g. AM failure to start issues).\n\nI think easily controlling this property is equally important in production clusters. Consider the following scenario:\n\n* A job failing on a production cluster.\n* Tasklogs are not showing much, and it is required to inspect the containers' files for any clues.\n* It is now required to change this configuration property (e.g. set it to 1 day) and restart every NM in the cluster (see how expensive this is).\n* The problem for this job is solved, but now these directories are kept for every submitted job, which is an unneeded and expensive storage problem. To solve that, we need to change back the property and restart NMs on all nodes again.\n\nAlso thinking about this issue more: YARN is a general framework, and applications other than MapReduce need to considered, and their ability to hint to yarn to keep these files. So we can't generalize assumptions about information available through specific application services (e.g. MapReduce JobHistoryServer). I think the new proposed property above can be generalized across applications (or the Application interface could be extended).\n\nbq. Your proposal doesn't work because the NodeManager doesn't load jobConf of the container... this would require changes to ContainerManager protocol.\n\nYes, I only wrote how the new delay will be calculated, but how this new jobConf property is communicated to the DeletionService will require more changes as you highlighted. The question here is whether the added benefit outweighs the effort of these extra changes.
