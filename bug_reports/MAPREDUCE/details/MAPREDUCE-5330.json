Bikas, I agree that this logic doesn't exactly match the meaning of SIGTERM.  To match SIGTERM, we really need a way for one process to signal another process with some \"graceful shutdown\" message, and a way for the other process to trigger custom code when it receives that message.  Unfortunately, I'm not aware of anything in the Windows API that provides an exact match.  Therefore, the logic in this patch seems to be the closest approximation that's feasible right now.\n\nTo elaborate on this, {{TerminateProcess}} immediately kills the target process, and there is no way for that process to trap the call and run custom clean-up code.\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686714(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nThis is much different from Unix signals, which allow the target process to install signal handlers to respond gracefully to things like SIGTERM.\n\nThere also seems to be some support for programmatically sending CTL-C to a process and installing a custom handler to respond to it.  This would be {{SetConsoleCtrlHandler}} and {{GenerateConsoleCtrlEvent}}.  I've heard anecdotally that this can be used to create a rough approximation of Unix signals, but I haven't tried it myself.\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms686016(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nhttp://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ms683155(v=vs.85).aspx\n\nAside from that, the only other option seems to be for Windows applications to roll their own custom IPC protocol (i.e. one process sends another a custom graceful shutdown message over a named pipe).\n\nIt might be worth pursuing one of these solutions in the long term for absolute correctness, but these approaches will require a lot more coding and testing.\n\nXi, please let me know if I've missed anything regarding signaling capabilities in the Windows API.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cnauroth","name":"cnauroth","key":"cnauroth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=cnauroth&avatarId=11432"},"displayName":"Chris Nauroth","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-07-04T04:23:21.376+0000","updated":"2013-07-04T04:23:21.376+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12653591/comment/13708081","id":"13708081","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ivanmi","name":"ivanmi","key":"ivanmi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ivan Mitic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Chris, Bikas, Xi, I filed a new Jira MAPREDUCE-5387 to investigate possible ways to implement Signal.TERM on Windows.
