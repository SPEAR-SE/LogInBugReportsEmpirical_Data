The problem is that the JobClient pulls classes from the classpath rather than the submitted jar file. Because the jar file may contain newer (or older) versions of classes on the classpath this behavior leads to confusing errors when the job is run. It is also a pain to ensure that the jar file being submitted is on the classpath. Further, if the JobClient uses the submitted jar file rather than the classpath, missing classes from the jar file can be detected earlier.\n\nThis patch will cause the JobClient to load the classes for a job from the jar file rather than the classpath. Because of the class loading precedence rules in Java, if the class is on the system class path, it will be loaded from there rather than the submitted jar file, but now users need not (and should not) put job classfiles on the system classpath.\n\nThis patch also allows config files to be put in a configuration directory rather than on the classpath, which also eliminates some confusing behavior when there are duplicate instances of config files in different parts of the classpath.
