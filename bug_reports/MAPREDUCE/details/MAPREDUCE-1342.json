Have you checked if the semantics remain same after removing the synchronized keyword? I think making _potentiallyFaultyTrackers_ as concurrent HashMap is better but might be dangerous.\n\nOne other way to avoid the deadlock would be by marking few non-private apis in JobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo as synchronized. Mainly\n{code}\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.incrementFaults // called via Heartbeat and testcases\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.markTrackerHealthy // called via Heartbeat\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.shouldAssignTasksToTracker // called via Heartbeat and testcases\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.isBlacklisted // called in multiple cases .. need to check\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.getFaultCount // called via Heartbeat and testcases\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.getReasonForBlackListing // never used!\nJobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.setNodeHealthStatus // called via Heartbeat and testcases\n{code}\n\nSo except JobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.isBlacklisted(), all the calls are centrally locked on JobTracker. Hence adding the synchronized keyword in the method signature wouldnt introduce any overhead. Need to check on JobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.isBlacklisted().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-01-04T06:08:45.536+0000","updated":"2010-01-04T06:08:45.536+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444293/comment/12796099","id":"12796099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Wouldnt simply making JobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.potentiallyFaultyTrackers a concurrent HashMap and removing the *synchronized* block in JobTracker.FaultyTrackerInfo.isBlacklisted() solve the deadlock issue?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-01-04T06:36:54.927+0000","updated":"2010-01-04T06:36:54.927+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12444293/comment/12796100","id":"12796100","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sreekanth","name":"sreekanth","key":"sreekanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sreekanth Ramakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching new patch after discussion with Amar.
