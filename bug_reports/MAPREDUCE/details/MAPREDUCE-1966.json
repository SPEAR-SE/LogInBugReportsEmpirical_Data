nodes that have been rendered unresponsive due to user abuse.  The existing blacklist heuristics touch on this, but they're a bit ad hoc, and there's not much visibility on the internal state at any given time.\n\nOne improvement would be to track the per-node, per-job blacklisting history in a sliding window that's divided into buckets of some suitable granularity.  Bad hardware would tend to show up as an elevated fault level on one node (or a few nodes) for an extended period--i.e., multiple buckets--while abusive jobs would tend to show up as a spike (ideally) or at least a limited-duration jump in faults (one or a few buckets) across many nodes.\n\nBecause the heuristics are open to argument even among experts (which would not include me), and because automatic, hardcoded blacklisting has the potential to wipe out a good fraction of a cluster for the wrong reasons, it would seem best to convert the heuristic form of blacklisting to an advisory mode (i.e., \"graylisting\") until the behavior is better understood.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=roelofs","name":"roelofs","key":"roelofs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Greg Roelofs","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-07-24T02:06:05.207+0000","updated":"2010-07-24T02:06:05.207+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12470056/comment/12900154","id":"12900154","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=roelofs","name":"roelofs","key":"roelofs","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Greg Roelofs","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Initial patch;
