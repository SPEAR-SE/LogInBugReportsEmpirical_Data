This patch (MAPREDUCE-4669.001.patch) contains the MR changes that rely on YARN-8448.001.patch.\r\n\r\nSome notes on the patch:\r\n - The {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.enabled}} property controls if the MR AM should try to use the Yarn-provided keystore (when set to {{true}}); this will also cause it to provide an HTTPS tracking URL to the RM. It defaults to {{false}}.\r\n - The {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.client.auth}} property controls if the MR AM should require client authentication (when set to {{true}}). It defaults to {{false}}. In this case, the MR AM is the server and the RM is the client, so this requires that the RM present its certificate to the AM when it connects to the AM - the AM can then verify this certificate with the Yarn-provided truststore.\r\n - It won't compile without the YARN-8448 patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rkanter","name":"rkanter","key":"rkanter","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Kanter","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-07-25T22:43:47.122+0000","updated":"2018-07-25T22:44:53.723+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/MAPREDUCE-4669/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0d2hr:"}}
