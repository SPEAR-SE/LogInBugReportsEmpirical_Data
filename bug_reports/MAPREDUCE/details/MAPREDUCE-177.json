So when the second gridmix is run, the JobTracker has the entire set of jobs from the first gridmix. i.e., nearly a 100K maps and 1000s of reducers, right?

Seems like the performance is dependent on the number of tasks kept in memory. One way to test this would be to start a job on a jobtracker (~2gb heap) with 400K tasks (no-op map tasks). Initially you will see the jobtracker working fine but later it will slow down and will start losing heartbeat. I tried this on 0.17. The best I could get was roughly 200K-250K tasks after which I started seeing this slowdown. Never tried with back to back jobs though.\n\n{quote}\nAlso, we need to understand how the number of tasks kept in memory impacts the performance.\n{quote}\nThere was an effort made by Dhruba (HADOOP-4018) to cap {{JobTracker's}} memory but ultimately we ended up doing something else.

Note that the total memory used after running 9 sleep jobs (100,000 maps with 1 sec wait) back to back (few were killed) was ~384MB.\nI realized that while performing the above experiment I was constantly analyzing job history which loads the parsed job's history in the memory. \n\nHere are the results for the same experiment on 200 nodes without any interference.\n\n||run-no ||memory before job-run ||job-runtime||\n|1      |9.74 MB               |25.78 min|\n|2      |71 MB                 |25.58 min |\n|3      |4.88 MB               |25.63 min|\n|4      |6.14 MB               |25.60 min|\n|5      |4.92 MB               |25.63 min|\n|6      |10.32 MB              |25.63 min|\n\nEven after running few large (100,000 maps) jobs the job tracker memory usage went as low as 3MB. It went upto a maximum of ~80MB. Note that I did GC in the {{ExpireLaunchingTasks}} thread. \n\nSome points to note :\n- I think that {{JobTracker}} should have a mechanism where it drops completed jobs whenever it suspects that its running low on memory. There is no point in keeping 100 jobs per user and slowing down/killing the JT. One way to do this would be to drop completed jobs whenever the JT's memory(used memory) crosses x% of maximum available memory. x% by default can be 75%. Completed jobs might be evicted based on their age (job finish time). This cleanup should happen until the JT's memory goes below the limit. \n- Also a job should be accepted (expanded) once there is sufficient memory i.e within the usable memory (x * max_available_memory).\n- Job history analysis caches some job analysis results (see {{loadhistory.jsp}}). This might cause problem if large jobs are analyzed. I feel we should not cache job-history analysis results and redo it everytime.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-24T12:02:32.496+0000","updated":"2008-12-24T12:02:32.496+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409856/comment/12660269","id":"12660269","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Attaching a patch that cleans up completed jobs as and when the jobtracker runs low on memory.

With this we will avoid immediate (memory) cleanups and also avoid frequent calls to _GC_. _X_ can be 25%.\n- Sort the job on _num-tasks_ instead of _finish-time_ as the chances of freeing up memory will be definitely.\n\nWe can do all these things as we have no contract regarding the web-ui display of completed jobs. But the only drawback with these approaches is that we have to manually invoke _GC_ for that which might be problematic. There is no point in cleaning _X%_ if there is no way to know if the memory usage is under control (doing _GC_).

Things like freeMemory, totalMemory seems to be quite dependent on the GC in use. Also it is not guaranteed that the usedMemory will go down once some jobs are removed since it is entirely up to the JVM when to actually do a full GC. Until that happens, we might end up in a situation where we purge every newly completed job even though memory is available (since the check for totalMemory - freeMemory in the patch might still show memory usage to be above the threshold). This would mean that users would start hitting the JobHistory for viewing jobs much more frequently. JobHistory file-loading/parsing is quite an expensive operation and should be avoided if possible. \nAs a follow-up jira, we might move the JobHistory server to a completely different process outside the JobTracker, and always purge completed jobs immediately. That would keep the UI aspects for serving completed jobs completely outside the JobTracker and should really help the JobTracker overall.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2009-01-17T08:22:46.983+0000","updated":"2009-01-17T08:22:46.983+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409856/comment/12664940","id":"12664940","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=amar_kamat","name":"amar_kamat","key":"amar_kamat","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Amar Kamat","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1.

In my experiments with this patch and a standalone program simulating the same behavior as what the patch is trying to do, I saw that even after purging all the jobs, the memory usage as per Runtime.totalMemory - Runtime.freeMemory didn't come down for quite a while and the thread was trying to free up memory needlessly (note that things like whether incremental GC is in use would also influence this behavior).\nThe approach of basing things on keeping at most 'n' completed tasks in memory at least leads to much more predictability. True that we don't know that the exact memory consumed by a TIP but we can make a good estimate there and tweak the value of the max tasks in memory if need be. Also, in the current patch, the configuration to do with the memory usage threshold is equally dependent on estimation. I am not sure what the threshold should be - should it be 0.75 or 0.9 or 0.8..\nWhy do you say it is an overkill - i thought basing things on estimating total memory usage is more trickier. Basing it on number of completed tasks seems very similar to the \"number of completed jobs\" that we currently have. It's just that we are stepping one level below and specifying a value for something the base size of which is going to always remain in control. Also, completed jobs should be treated as one unit w.r.t removal. For example, if the value configured for the max tasks is 1000, and we have a job with 1100 tasks, the entire job should be removed (as opposed to removing only 1000 tasks of the job), keeping this whole thing really simple.\nAgain, this is a short term fix until we move to the model of having a separate History server process.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=devaraj","name":"devaraj","key":"devaraj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Devaraj Das","active":true,"timeZone":"Pacific/Pitcairn"},"created":"2009-01-20T17:53:28.827+0000","updated":"2009-01-20T17:53:28.827+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12409856/comment/12665572","id":"12665572","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=owen.omalley","name":"owen.omalley","key":"owen.omalley","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=owen.omalley&avatarId=29697"},"displayName":"Owen O'Malley","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"I think this is the wrong direction.
