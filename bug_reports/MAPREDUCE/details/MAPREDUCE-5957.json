Currently MRApps.setJobClassLoader() sets both the configuration classloader and the TCCL at the same time. So once setJobClassLoader() is called, it is made available in both contexts.\n\nMAPREDUCE-5751 was caused because the job classloader was made available *too early as the TCCL*. This issue is caused because the job classloader is made available *too late as the configuration classloader*.\n\nThe normal classloading scheme (one class initializing another class via normal use or even Class.forName) is unaffected by this if my understanding is correct.\n\nI see two possible approaches for this:\n(1) separate the timing of setting the job classloader as the configuration classloader and the TCCL\nI think while setting the TCCL should be delayed as much as possible (i.e. the current timing), the job classloader can be installed as the configuration classloader much earlier. If the configuration loads a user class, that's precisely what we need. If it loads a system class, the job classloader will delegate anyhow. I don't think there is harm in setting the configuration classloader early.\n\n(2) set and unset the job classloader around the code that loads classes from the configuration\nIdentify the code points in MRAppMaster where Configuration.getClass() is needed, and set and unset the job classloader around them. Although this would also solve this problem, the downside is that one needs to make a determination that the job classloader is needed and set/unset it. This is potentially brittle.\n\nI think (1) is a more robust solution to this problem. Do you see an issue with taking that approach?\n\nI don't think the task (YarnChild) is affected by this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-02T15:40:40.377+0000","updated":"2014-07-02T15:40:40.377+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724880/comment/14050828","id":"14050828","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Patch that implements approach (1)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-02T22:53:22.912+0000","updated":"2014-07-02T22:53:22.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724880/comment/14050871","id":"14050871","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

On the one hand, if we make the job classloader available early (but hold back setting the TCCL) this one time change would be sufficient to cover future changes when another instance of custom class loading is needed. That's why I gravitated to that approach. It is true that if the custom class needs to load another class via TCCL in its constructor (and a couple of other methods that get called by MRAppMaster) then it is a problem. It's a fairly uncommon scenario, but I can't say it should never happen.\n\nSurrounding custom class loading with setting and unsetting of the job classloader (both as the configuration classloader and as TCCL) does solve that problem. And I can't think of a case where making it available as TCCL during that time period would cause a different type of problems (along the line of MAPREDUCE-5751). Even if this thing invokes jetty initialization for example, it would have compelled its own copy of jetty and things would stay consistent within that class namespace.\n\nThe main problem I have with this approach is that it's bit more expensive to maintain. Every time new code is added to load a custom class in MRAppMaster, we *must* remember to wrap it with setting and unsetting the job classloader. It's perfectly doable, but leaves room for making mistakes.\n\nI can bring up the second version of the patch that implements the other approach. Shall we discuss that a little more then?

I agree that it is quite likely things will break as the code is maintained.  Not only do we have to flip-flop each time a new custom class is loaded but also each time we invoke a method on a user-provided instance.  So if a new committer method is added or what-not that needs to be called before we finally throw the classloader switch for good then that's another necessary flip-flop.  That's annoying and probably won't be remembered when the new method invocation is added.\n\nIf we do stick with the flip-flop approach then it'd be nice if we had a nice way to wrap such code with a common flip-flop wrapper.  I'm thinking something akin to how UserGroupInformation.doAs works so we can wrap code with common logic and don't have to copy-n-paste the wrapper everywhere.  However the wrapped code has to be marshaled in the form of a Runnable or what-not, so that might not be much better in the end.\n\nSo I guess it comes down to weighing the likelihood this will ever be needed in practice or if simply setting the conf classloader will \"just work.\"  I'm not as worried about the reflection case since that's probably rare to do without already leveraging Hadoop's conf class property processing.  However I'm worried about thread creation since I could see a case where a committer/speculator/whatever creates some threads in their constructor or some other method we invoke before throwing the final classloader switch.  If those threads end up inheriting the system TCCL instead of the job classloader TCCL then we have a problem.  If that indeed is what would happen then it comes down to how likely is it that user code will want to create threads in constructors/methods that are invoked before the final classloader switch.  I don't know offhand, unfortunately.\n\nIf we can convince ourselves the thread use by user methods invoked before the final loader switch is either a non-issue or super unlikely then I think we should go for the simpler fix to set the conf loader early.  Otherwise I think we may be stuck doing the flip flop case just for correctness sake, and hopefully we can make that as painless and obvious as possible.\n\nWhich reminds me, the CommitterEventHandler creates a thread with which it invokes methods on the output committer.  That thread is going to have the system TCCL since it was created before the final classloader switch, correct?  If so would we also have problems if the output committer does lazy thread creation or class loading when commit methods are invoked as the job runs?  Seems like the CommitterEventHandler event handling thread needs the job classloader, if specified.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-15T23:01:17.112+0000","updated":"2014-07-15T23:01:17.112+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724880/comment/14062900","id":"14062900","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.

I think it will lead to easier and more obvious handling of this. I'll update the patch to do that (lambda would have been very nice btw).\n\nAlso, a good catch about the committer event handler thread creation. I'll also handle that scenario.\n\nI think the latest patch should cover at least all these known cases, except for one. It's the composite service's serviceInit() and serviceStart(). In case of the speculator, it's added as a service to the parent composite service. As such, super.serviceInit() and super.serviceStart() will invoke its serviceInit() and serviceStart(). If it loads classes via configuration classloader or TCCL, it will break.\n\nNote that normal classloading will still work. For that matter, if any of these classes loads other classes in the normal way, that still works fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-07-16T05:01:21.336+0000","updated":"2014-07-16T05:01:21.336+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724880/comment/14063296","id":"14063296","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.

I do think the wrapper makes it a bit clearer we're calling something within the context of the job classloader.\n\nOne of the drawbacks of the wrapper is that it's harder to deal with checked exceptions.  For example, MRAppMaster.isRecoverySupported used to propagate any IOException thrown by the user-provided committer code, but the wrapper now transforms this into a runtime exception.  Not sure it really makes a whole lot of difference in practice for that case, but it is a subtle change in behavior.  Do you think it's worth adding a wrapper form that can throw Exception (or maybe just IOException)?  Thinking along similar lines as PrivilegedAction vs. PrivilegedExceptionAction in the doAs scenarios.  I guess callers can catch YarnRuntimeException with the current patch and check the cause if they want/need to convert it back to a checked exception themselves, but curious on your thoughts.\n\nOtherwise I think the patch looks good.  Couple of minor additional items:\n\n- Is there a reason the init transition calls MRAppMaster.createJobClassloader rather than having MRAppMaster.serviceInit do it?  Seems more natural to have the serviceInit method initialize the MRAppMaster data members if possible.\n- Not strictly related to this JIRA, but I happened to notice that MRAppMaster.isRecoverySupported takes a committer argument that it totally ignores.  Since we're in the area, it would be nice to clean that up by either removing the argument or use it rather than the committer member.  Totally OK with me if you'd rather postpone that minor cleanup to another JIRA.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-07-16T20:33:53.965+0000","updated":"2014-07-16T20:33:53.965+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12724880/comment/14064149","id":"14064149","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sjlee0","name":"sjlee0","key":"sjlee0","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=sjlee0&avatarId=16831"},"displayName":"Sangjin Lee","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.

Is there a reason the init transition calls MRAppMaster.createJobClassloader rather than having MRAppMaster.serviceInit do it?\n\nNothing other than that I wanted to create it as early as possible.
