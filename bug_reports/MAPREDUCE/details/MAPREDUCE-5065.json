So you could have 2 different files with identical contents (but different block-sizes) have different checksums. (Thus, it's also possible for DistCp to fail to copy files on the same file-system, if the source-file's block-size differs from HDFS default, and -pb isn't used.)\n\nI propose that we skip checksum comparisons under the following conditions:\n1. -skipCrc is specified.\n2.

Currently the file checksum works by taking the CRC32 for every 512 byte chunk of the block, combining these with MD5 into a single checksum for the block, then combining these with MD5 into a single checksum for the file.  The first combination is done at the Datanode (in DataXceiver#blockChecksum) and the second at the client (in DFSClient#getFileChecksum).  If instead the client could directly retrieve the list of CRC32s from the datanode then it could combine them into a blocksize-independent checksum (so long as blockSize is a multiple of bytesPerChecksum and bytesPerChecksum is the same between the filesystems, which is ordinarily the case).  Op.java already includes a READ_METADATA operation, presumably intended to return the CRC32s to the client, but it is not implemented.  We'd probably want to extend the getFileChecksum API to permit specifying the type of checksum requested, whether MD5MD5CRC32 or MD5CRC32.

The user will still need to fail first and rerun, because she's unlikely to know that some of her source-files might have non-default block-sizes. Unless the checksum calculation is fixed (or -pb is default), I don't think DistCp should enforce a check that's a guaranteed failure, under unforeseeable circumstances.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-03-15T14:41:00.229+0000","updated":"2013-03-15T14:41:00.229+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12636934/comment/13603420","id":"13603420","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mithun","name":"mithun","key":"mithun","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mithun&avatarId=18936"},"displayName":"Mithun Radhakrishnan","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated patches so that post-copy checksum comparisons are dropped with -skipCrc, on Hadoop-0.23.
