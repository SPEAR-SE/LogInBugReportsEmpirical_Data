Thus ClientRMService should send an event to RMAppManager which then creates the RMApp, adds to list and sends other notifications. Similarly APP_COMPLETED comes over to RMAppManager which then deletes RMApps as in your patch. \nThoughts?

One question from an MR2 n00b: in MR1, these configs were very error prone since different jobs took up wildly variant amounts of RAM. So a value of 100 retained jobs would work fine for small jobs but fail miserably with OOME if bigger jobs were submitted. Then we added all of the limits to try to curtail this, but it's a bit of a stopgap rather than a real solution.\n\nIs this better in MR2 because the state on the RM is much smaller? Or is there still per-container state being retained?\n\nOne thing we should consider is to adopt an interface like HBase's \"HeapSize\" -- objects that are going to be retained/cached need to implement it, and then the limit scan be set based on memory usage rather than strict counts.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2011-08-20T00:27:25.718+0000","updated":"2011-08-20T00:27:25.718+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12513017/comment/13088851","id":"13088851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"bq.
