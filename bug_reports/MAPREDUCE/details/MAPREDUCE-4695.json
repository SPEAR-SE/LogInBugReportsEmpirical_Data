I don't think that ClientServiceDelegate.java needs to be changed at all.\n\nThats my dummy change to trigger tests in jobclient (tests reside there, while default xml is in core, a problem we've yet to fix, will follow up on this afterwards). It won't go into the final patch.\n\nbq. It would also be nice to add in a test so that changes like this don't break it again in the future, but I am not sure how easy that would be so I am OK without it.\n\nIf we moved all tests to their right module we wouldn't have this issue (i.e. we won't miss it in pre commit builds).\n\nThanks Robert, I'll commit this in (new patch minus jobclient package change).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qwertymaniac","name":"qwertymaniac","key":"qwertymaniac","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=qwertymaniac&avatarId=16780"},"displayName":"Harsh J","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2012-10-01T17:01:17.407+0000","updated":"2012-10-01T17:01:17.407+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12609762/comment/13466955","id":"13466955","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:red}-1 overall{color}.
