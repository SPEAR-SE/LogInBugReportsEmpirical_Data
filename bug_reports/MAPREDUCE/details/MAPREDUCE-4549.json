Thank you for calling me out on this it was my bad.  \n\nI spoke with Mohammad Islam and Virag Kothari.  The extent of the conversation was primarily me clarifying the differences between 1.0 behavior of the distributed cache, the behavior of the cache in 2.0/0.23 prior to MAPREDUCE-4503, and its behavior post MAPREDUCE-4503. After that we talked about my proposed fix here, of turning the exception into a warning.  They both were OK with that but wanted to perhaps look into having the error checking in 2.0 also happen as new items were added through the distributed cache APIs so that they could react to the issues on a per entry basis, instead of having the job submission fail.  I thought this was reasonable and told them to file a JIRA against MAPREDUCE for it.\n\nI am happy for any other feedback people may have on the issues.  The call was mostly for clarification.  I probably didn't even need to mention it here, but since I did here is the full disclosure.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-08-16T18:59:31.139+0000","updated":"2012-08-16T18:59:31.139+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12603244/comment/13436261","id":"13436261","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tucu00","name":"tucu00","key":"tucu00","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Abdelnur","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Madrid"},"body":"No worries, no need to be sorry at all.
