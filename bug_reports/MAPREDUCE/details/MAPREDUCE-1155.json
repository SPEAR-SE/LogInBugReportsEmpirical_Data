Primary changes:\n - Got rid of a bunch of instances where exceptions were just printed and didn't fail the tests.\n - Fixed StreamJob so that IllegalArgumentExceptions are only swallowed during the argument parsing, and not when they come from inside MR. (this is the only change to non-test code)\n - Fixed a bunch of instances where a failTrace() method had been copy pasted and used in exception catch blocks. This is unnecessary in tests - simply letting it bubble up to the test harness is more idiomatic.\n - Fixed a bug where TestMultipleArchivefiles was actually failing the job\n\nThese tests could do with a whole lot more cleanup work, but this is a good start and at least makes them fail properly when there are problems.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tlipcon","name":"tlipcon","key":"tlipcon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tlipcon&avatarId=26804"},"displayName":"Todd Lipcon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Tijuana"},"created":"2009-12-04T01:20:00.720+0000","updated":"2009-12-04T01:20:00.720+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12439096/comment/12785776","id":"12785776","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.

Case in point: I was trying to TestStreamingExitStatus / TestStreamingKeyValue test cases. The former did not have a proper cleanup , while the latter failed because of the same.
