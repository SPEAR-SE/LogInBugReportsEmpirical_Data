Under YARN this will not work.  It is the application master that determines the command line that is used to launch the container not the nodemanager.  So if the application master is running on a system with a different java.library.path on it then the system the container is running on then it will not work (Think Hadoop is installed in a different location on different machines).  Also the application master does not have the java.library.path set because the client did not set it when launching.\n\nI think the best way to solve this is to add in code to the nodemanager that would do a replace a @hadoop-java.library.path@ with the nodemanager's java.library.path similar to how the application master will replace @taskid@ with the task id for the application.  Any thoughts on this?

Here 'env' can be jars, shared-objects etc.\n\nI'm thinking we shud just bite the bullet, go the whole 9 yards and fix the classpath/ld_library_path etc. in the *correct* way i.e. throw out our reliance on bin/mapred and do everything via the DistributedCache i.e. MAPREDUCE-2880. \n\nThoughts? \n\nApologies for dragging this. IAC, this won't fix the original issue - the NM doesn't have the right java.library.path for setting up compression libs correctly.\n\nArguably we can fix this, but I'd rather do it the *right* way i.e. MAPREDUCE-2880.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2011-09-15T00:02:59.172+0000","updated":"2011-09-15T00:02:59.172+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12518499/comment/13105372","id":"13105372","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=revans2","name":"revans2","key":"revans2","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Robert Joseph Evans","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I am fine with doing it through the distributed cache.  You made a very good point that the java.library.path/LD_LIBRARY_PATH for the nodemanager is likely to be different from what we want.  It may fix a couple of issues with native code in common, but not the native code in map/reduce.  So the patch is wrong and really should not go in.
