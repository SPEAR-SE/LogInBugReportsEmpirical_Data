The RM will already tell AMs to die, via AMResponse.getReboot(), if they are not a valid app attempt.  We could use a concept of a \"commit window\" indicating a relatively short amount of time.  This window should be large enough to encompass how long the AM will take to respond to a heartbeat and turn around and start committing.  This should be at least as long as the AM heartbeat interval but not a lot longer (e.g.: 10 seconds).  Here's a walkthrough of how it would work for a task (job commit is similar):\n\n# Task requests to commit, AM tells it to hold off for now\n# AM writes a task-starting-commit event to job history file and ensures it is flushed to disk before progressing to next step\n# Next time task asks to commit, AM checks the last time it received a valid heartbeat response from the RM\n#* If last heartbeat was within the commit window then the AM responds that the task can start committing\n#* If last heartbeat was outside the commit window then the AM responds that the task must hold off for now while it waits to receive a valid heartbeat from the RM to verify it is still a valid app attempt\n\nAnd here's how subsequent attempts would handle recovery:\n\n# AM waits for the duration of the commit window before reading the previous attempt's history file to allow any potential lingering task-starting-commit messages to be written to the job history file\n# If the history file shows a task started committing but did not complete then we treat this as if the task commit failed, i.e.: we fail the task\n# If the history file shows the job started committing but did not complete then we treat this as if the job commit failed, i.e.: we fail the job\n\nThe initial wait during recovery could be reduced if the RM told the attempt when the last time it heard a valid heartbeat from a prior attempt.  Then the subsequent attempt could subtract this amount of time from the commit window (which in many cases would eliminate the need to wait at all).\n\nThere's some performance concerns around sync'ing task-starting-commmit events, although we could play tradeoff games where we delay sync'ing a bit in hopes other tasks will want to commit as well so we can batch them together and amortize the sync cost.  However I do think that we need to ensure a task-is-committing-so-do-not-repeat-it marker needs to be persisted somewhere before progressing otherwise we could double-commit.  Only way we might be able to avoid that is if the committer interface allowed the AM to determine that it commits in such a way where double-commits are not a concern.  The task-starting-commit events could be skipped in that case, but that's a committer API change.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-30T21:54:17.281+0000","updated":"2012-11-30T21:54:17.281+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618217/comment/13507694","id":"13507694","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Linking to MAPREDUCE-4831 and MAPREDUCE-4819 since they all discuss the issue of potential double-commits at the task or job level.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-11-30T22:02:32.030+0000","updated":"2012-11-30T22:02:32.030+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618217/comment/13542453","id":"13542453","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Patch that implements the \"commit window\" concept outlined above.

So if the NM loses contact with the RM or if the RM thinks the AM should not be running anymore on that NM,then the expire time will not be extended.

Seems like it's possible to avoid multiple AMs by tuning the AM_LIVENESS_INTERVAL (10 minutes by default) and MR_AM_TO_RM_WAIT_INTERVAL_MS (6 minutes by default). A new AM should only be started after the existing AM is done.\n\nThat *almost* solves the problem, but there are some corner cases left unsolved.  For example:\n\n1) AM is running on a node whose NM suddenly declares itself UNHEALTHY via health-check script\n2) RM removes node from active nodes and kills all containers running on that node\n3) Network cut occurs.  NM did not receive notification to kill the containers and/or NM crashes.  AM is unable to communicate to RM.\n4) RM now thinks all containers are dead on that node, proceeds to relaunch a new AM attempt\n5) Now for the next 6 minutes (or whatever the expiry interval is for the AM to RM) we have two app attempts running simultaneously.  If the old AM attempt is able to reach HDFS or whatever it needs to commit, we could end up committing twice.\n\nbq. Could add a check to ensure the window interval is greater than the AM-RM heartbeat.\n\nActually that's not strictly necessary.  The code can function correctly even if the commit window is smaller than the heartbeat interval.  For example, job commit is woken up when a fresh heartbeat arrives, and task commit polls periodically for whether the heartbeat has occurred recently.  It's not mandatory that the interval between heartbeats is smaller than the commit window for a commit to proceed, but it is more likely a commit operation will be stalled waiting for a fresh heartbeat if configured that way.\n\nbq. Does getClock() need to be part of the RMHeartbeatHandler. Looks like the AppContext can provide this\n\nI put it in the interface so the caller can access the same clock used to timestamp the heartbeat in case it could be different from the AppContext clock or if the caller didn't have access to the AppContext.  But that's probably never going to be a real concern, so I'll take it out.\n\nAnd to address Bikas' comment:\nbq. Independent of this change, this looks like a problem that needs to be solved in the platform than in the AM.\n\nWe might be able to close all the corner cases in the framework.  For example, the above scenario could be solved if the RM were to wait for confirmation from the NM of the containers actually expiring before proceeding to launch another attempt.  If the NM is unreachable before the confirmation is received, it could wait for the AM expiry interval before launching a new attempt.  It could mean that we wait a lot longer than necessary, but at least we'd know with confidence that two attempts aren't running simultaneously.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-03T23:30:52.246+0000","updated":"2013-01-03T23:30:52.246+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618217/comment/13543456","id":"13543456","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"Updated patch to remove getClock() from RMHeartbeatHandler interface.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlowe","name":"jlowe","key":"jlowe","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Lowe","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2013-01-04T00:28:28.028+0000","updated":"2013-01-04T00:28:28.028+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618217/comment/13543475","id":"13543475","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"{color:green}+1 overall{color}.
