Please correct me if I’m off on the definition here. I believe used Capacity is meant to be what % of the parent am I using. Similar to how capacity/max capacity apply to the parent.   I expected usedCapacity to be what utilization is defined as, which is what I thought users will be interested in -> how much of the resources normally allocated to my queue (absoluteCapacity) am I using right now. I think Utilization = absoluteUsedCapacity.   \n\nIs a user normally really going to care what % of my parent queue they are using? To me the absoluteCapacity is what I’m interested in because my queue has X amount of memory allocated to it, and I have Y left. \nI can see admins being interested in the used Capacity as they can quickly see what percent of the parent is being used by the various leaf queues.\n\nright now definitions are:\nutilization = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * absoluteCapacity)\nusedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * capacity)\n\nHere is an example, which I believe demonstrates usedCapacity being off - lets say cluster has 32G memory total:\n\nQueue definitions:\nroot - capacity = absoluteCapacity = 100% - 32G\nroot.a - capacity=50%, absoluteCap = 100*50=50% - 16G\nroot.a.a1 - capacity = 50%, absoluteCap = (100*50)*50 = 25% - 8G\nroot.a.a2 - capacity = 50%, absoluteCap = (100*50)*50% = 25% - 8G\nroot.b - capacity = 20%, absoluteCap = 100*20=20% - 6.4G\nroot.b.b1 - capacity = 60%, absoluteCap = 100*20%*60% = 12%, MaxCap = -1 (lets me go over my capacity) = 3.84G\nroot.c - capacity = 30%, absoluteCap = 100*30=30% - 9.6G\nroot.c.c1 - capacity = 75%, absoluteCap = 100*30%*75* = 22.5% = 7.2G\n\n\nNow I start a job that uses 4G submitted to a1.\nroot used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G\nroot.a used = 4/(32*.5) = 25%, utilization = 4/(32*.5) = 25% = 4G of 16G\nroot.a.a1 used = 4/(32 *.5) = 25%, utilization = 4/(32*.25) = 50% => this just happens to work because capacity = parent asoluteCap\n\njob in a1 finishes. now start a job that uses 4G submitted to b1\nroot used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G\nroot.b used = 4/(32*.2) = 62.5%, utilization = 4/(32*.2) = 62.5% = 4G of 6.4G\nroot.b.b1 used = 4/(32 *.6) = 20.8% (4G of 6.4G ??), utilization = 4/(32*.12) = 104% (4G of 3.84G) \n\nthe 20.8% doesn't make sense to me?  I'm using 4G of my parents 6.4G - that should be 62.5%.  \n\njob in a1 finishes. now start a job that uses 4G submitted to c1\nroot used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G\nroot.c used = 4/(32*.3) = 41.6%, utilization = 4/(32*.3) = 41.6% = 4G of 9.6G\nroot.c.c1 used = 4/(32 *.75) = 16.6% (4G of 9.6G ??), utilization = 4/(32*.225) = 55.5% (4G of 7.2G) \n\nAgain the 16.6% I think is wrong as it should be 4G of the 9.6G or 41.6%\n\nI think the formula should be \nusedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * parent.getAbsoluteCapacity())\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-01-23T01:08:49.806+0000","updated":"2012-01-23T01:08:49.806+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538670/comment/13190851","id":"13190851","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"I had made the updates for \nusedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * parent.getAbsoluteCapacity())\nwhile testing, here is what I was running.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tgraves","name":"tgraves","key":"tgraves","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Thomas Graves","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2012-01-23T03:08:58.160+0000","updated":"2012-01-23T03:08:58.160+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12538670/comment/13190867","id":"13190867","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hadoopqa","name":"hadoopqa","key":"hadoopqa","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=hadoopqa&avatarId=10393"},"displayName":"Hadoop QA","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"+1 overall.
