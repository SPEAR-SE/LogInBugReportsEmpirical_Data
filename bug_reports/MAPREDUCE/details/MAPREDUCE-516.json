C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"A _much_ better model is for the scheduler to *pick* specific TaskTrackers and reserve slots on them while accounting for the same against the HighRAMJob and it's queue. This would mean that once there is a reserved slot(s), per-task of the HighRAMJob, other slots in the cluster can be handed out to other jobs/queues in the cluster. \n\n Once the accounting for reserved slots is fixed, it would automatically ensure that a HighRAMJob can only reserve slots upto the quota of the queue it belongs to. Hence the next enhancement is to *pick* specific slots and hold them rather than hold slots on every TaskTracker.\n\nh4. Picking slots for High RAM Jobs\n  \n The key to better support for HighRAMJobs is to reserve slots on specific TaskTracker. Of course one could get arbitrarily clever while *picking* slots, factors to be considered are: \n   * Locality of input for the specific map-task of the job\n   * Minimize expected delay time until the slot in freed on a specific !TaskTracker\n\n For the first cut, I'd propose we consider only locality and not expected time. Once we fix _speculative execution_ (HADOOP-2141), we will more of the necessary features to predict expected time etc., hence the pushback.\n\nh4. Accounting for Reserved Slots\n\n It is critical that we charge the queues of the HighRAMJobs when we hold reserved slots for them to ensure that they stay under their capacity and can't runaway with slots in the cluster. The proposal is to charge jobs/queues immediately when we reserve slots on a TaskTracker (when it can't be immediately run).\n\n \nh4. Metering\n\n While metering HighRAMJobs, it would be incorrect to meter jobs (slot-hours etc.) by equating reserved slots to _running_ slots. The proposal is to meter HighRAMJobs for open-but-held slots and running slots. (Open but held slots are those which are free on the TaskTracker but are being held while more become available for the HighRAMJob's tasks.)\n\nh4. Notes on Implementation and Challenges\n \n As discussed above the proposal is to consider just data-locality while reserving slots. Assuming this, there are a couple of implementation choices once we reserved the slot: \n   * Proposal1: Hand out the task to the TaskTracker with a directive to start the task only when sufficient slots are freed-up to the this task.\n   * Proposal2: Hold the task at the scheduler noting which slot (i.e. TaskTracker) has been reserved for the same.\n\nh5. Proposal 1\n\n Here we would introduce a queue of _ready to run_ tasks at the TaskTracker and fill it in with the task of the HighRAMJobs.\n\nh6. Pros\n   * The primary advantage of taking this route is that it greatly reduces the cost of implementation; it is fairly simple to introduce a WAITING_FOR_SLOT state for the task and have the necessary information at the TaskTracker to launch it at the appropriate time (i.e. when sufficient slots are free).\n   * Looking ahead, this might be a good start to do more global scheduling across jobs too where we might \n\nh6. Cons\n   * The major problem with this approach is that it touches a fairly sensitive part of code in the current implementation of the framework... it's fairly risky to tweak the TaskTracker code at this point, along with the JVMManager etc.\n   * We would still need to tweak the JobTracker to handle the WAITING_FOR_SLOT state e.g. ensure the TaskInitializationThread doesn't kill these tasks etc.\n   * We need to consider how this affects other schedulers (probably will not).\n\nh5. Proposal 2\n\n Here we would start marking slots as reserved (per task per job) and maintain information to assign the slot to the task when it eventually does free up.\n\nh6. Pros\n   * Simpler since all state management is done centrally.\n   * Lesser risk since all information is maintained in the scheduler.\n\nh6. Cons\n   * Currently the framework isn't setup to maintain this information: we do not have a single place (e.g. a TT class in the !JobTracker) to maintain information per-tracker i.e. reserved slots etc.\n   * More engineering effort to maintain maps from !TaskTracker to task to which it's reserved for and vice-versa.\n\nh5. Recommendation\n\n  * Proposal 1 for the attendant benefits and the leverage it gives us going forward (global scheduling etc.)\n\nh4. User Interface\n\n It is important for users (and queue-admins) to understand that there are slots which are _reserved_ for HighRAMJobs which result in lower running maps/reduces w.r.t the queue-capacities. It would be nice to add _reserved_ slots to the JobTracker/Job UI, and also to the Queue-Info in the Scheduler page.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-03T00:50:49.391+0000","updated":"2009-06-03T00:50:49.391+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426991/comment/12715772","id":"12715772","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Very early patch.\n\nI haven't introduced a WAITING_FOR_SLOT task state since it might be desirable for the ExpireLaunchingTasks thread to actually kill high-ram jobs which have waited too long.

This way, any changes to it will cause the right behavior for both APIs. Likewise, for reduces.\n\nmapreduce.TaskTracker:\n - reserveSlots: java doc refers to reserving on 'map' slots.\n - Why do we need to maintain a count of slots reserved (numFallowMapSlots).

Shouldn't we always be reserving only how much this job requires ? In that case, do we need a re-reservation ?\n - When we try to get a task for a job ignoring user limits (i.e. if the cluster is free), we are not reserving TTs. Is this by design ? Also, is it for the same reason that we are not checking for user limits when assigning a task to a reserved TT ?\n\nJobConf:\n - Since computeNumSlotsPerMap is used only by CapacityScheduler right now, should we just leave this computation out of JobConf ?\n\nJobInitializationPoller:\n - Lets not pass the scheduler instance to the poller. I think it only needs the number of map slots and reduce slots. We can pass just that much. We've seen in the past that passing entire objects like the scheduler makes testing classes difficult. Also, not all information is required.\n\nJobTracker:\n - When a job is killed, we are not clearing reserved trackers for this job.\n - Likewise, when a TT is blacklisted do we need to remove the reservations ?\n - It seems like the changes in JobTracker can be reduced a little if we do not change APIs that are passed a TTstatus object or a tasktracker name. We can still change the maps to be built of TaskTracker objects, but retrieve the status wherever necessary and pass it to methods. This way the changes may be fewer and easier to verify. For e.g. I think this is possible in the ExpireTrackers class.\n\nSome nits:\n- In some places, formatting more than 80 characters in a line. (E.g. mapreduce.TaskTracker.java)\n- There are lot of LOG.info statements, possibly to enable testing / debugging. Can you please remove these ?\n- Fallow seems a complicated word to understand.

Which is why I bit the bullet and changed all of them.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-19T06:59:58.990+0000","updated":"2009-06-19T06:59:58.990+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426991/comment/12721676","id":"12721676","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Forgot to add that I've managed to successfully test this patch on large clusters.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2009-06-19T07:02:53.728+0000","updated":"2009-06-19T07:02:53.728+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426991/comment/12721792","id":"12721792","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"body":"I've looked at most of the code changes (excluding tests and examples). Here are a few more comments:\n\nCapacityTaskScheduler:\n - In getTaskFromQueue, I would request a comment on why we are not reserving tasktrackers in the second pass (the reason, as we discussed offline, was because we don't think we need to give users more leeway by reserving slots given they are already over their user limit)\n\nJobTracker:\n - hostnameToTrackerName seems a wrong name. it should be hostnameToTracker\n - Comment on trackerExpiryQueue refers to TreeSet of status objects.\n - In recovery, there is an 'interesting' behavior currently that a job can be initialized by both the RecoveryManager or a job initialization thread like EagerTaskInitializer or JobInitializationPoller. Which means that relying on preInitializeJob to set the right number of slots may be broken.\n - Since we are not storing information about reservations across restarts, one impact could be on the fact that the counter information about how long reservations were made for a job on a tracker could be lost. This may not be a big issue because reservations themselves are lost on restart, but just wanted to check what you thought.\n\nmapreduce.TaskTracker:\n - I am thinking if it will be good to make unreserveSlots re-entrant. I struggled a bit to determine that it will never be called twice in any scenario, which seems to be the case now. But if we can make it re-entrant by simply ignoring the operation if the reserved Job is null, it might save us some corner case bugs. Note we are currently throwing a runtime exception.\n\nJobConf:\n - We are not handling the case where memory based scheduling is disabled, but jobconf has some non default value for the job size (say because of user misconfiguration). computeNumSlotsPerMap should probably check the value and return 1 if it is disabled. Otherwise it could get set to a -ve value.\n\nMemoryMatcher:\n - The computation of committed memory included tasks that were in the commit pending state for a reason. We'll need to check this with someone from the M/R team.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-06-19T14:14:34.412+0000","updated":"2009-06-19T14:14:34.412+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426991/comment/12722481","id":"12722481","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Thanks for the comments Hemanth.

Summary of changes:\n\n- Modified the fake objects in TestCapacityScheduler to include the correct slot information\n- Modified the display string in CapacityTaskScheduler.updateQSIObjects to what seemed more reasonable.\n- Reverted changes I had done in HADOOP-5964, as they are no longer needed with this patch. The previous code relied on jobconf to compute number of slots and had to handle cases where the job was not found (when it was retired). Since we now have this information in the TaskStatus, there's no need to handle this case.\n- Fixed testHighRamJobWithSpeculativeExecution - the previous test case wasn't entirely correct. Only catch is that the new test case does not cover a part of the code path to do with handling speculative reduces. I suppose that can be done in a follow-up JIRA.\n\nWith these changes, TestCapacityScheduler passes in my local machine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yhemanth","name":"yhemanth","key":"yhemanth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hemanth Yamijala","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"created":"2009-06-23T17:00:03.933+0000","updated":"2009-06-23T17:00:03.933+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12426991/comment/12723464","id":"12723464","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acmurthy","name":"acmurthy","key":"acmurthy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arun C Murthy","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Updated and hopefully final patch.
