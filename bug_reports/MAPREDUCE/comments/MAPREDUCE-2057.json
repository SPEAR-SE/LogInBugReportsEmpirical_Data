[
From a security perspective, the patches coming in 0.22 will make sure that a host is who it says it is by requiring Kerberized credentials.  (ignoring the some recognized MITM and IP spoofing attacks which the community has made the conscious choice to defer fixing)

That said, it would be better if Hadoop in general took the IP addr, reverse resolved, and then compared that to the config.  , I'm going to close this as fixed.]
