This message is automatically generated., Sandy, just curious, what should the behavior be if a user sets both but to different values? Do we give higher priority to mapred/mapreduce?, As mapred.task.timeout is the one mentioned in the documentation, I made it so that it gets preference.  Do you think that's the right behavior?, It looks good to me, but before committing it, what is the precedence behavior in trunk? to make sure we have the same behavior., It doesn't exactly appear that there is precedence behavior in trunk.  When a Configuration#set() is called for a config with deprecations, all the corresponding configs are set.  So if we came across mapred.task.timeout first in a config file, both mapred.task.timeout and mapreduce.task.timeout would get set. Then if we came across mapreduce.task.timeout afterwards, both would get overriden., +1 the precedence looks right to me., I just committed this. Thanks, Sandy!, Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
