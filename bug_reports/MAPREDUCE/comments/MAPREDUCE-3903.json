[As of right now it seems that the acls are disjoint between mapreduce and yarn.  Meaning turning on the yarn.acl.enable has no affect on the mapreduce history server or application master and turning on the mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled has no affect on RM and NM.  So following that model I am going to have mapreduce.cluster.administrators control the admin rather then just using yarn.admin.acl., So it actually appears we are inconsistent about acls.  If you are going through the web ui for AM or historyserver you get one behavior where it only checks the job acls, but if you go through the mapred cli which goes through the RM, it uses yarn acls and application acls. The application acls include the job acls.  Note that when going through the RM it doesn't seem to look at mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled at all even through it appends the job acls to application acls., Ok, so it looks like there are a few bugs in the code.  Here is basically what I am planning implementing:

- yarn acls/application acls are separate from mapreduce acls.  They only control what a user can view/modify on the RM.  This include the admins as well. So yarn.admins do not apply to AM/history server.  

- mapreduce job acls are put into application acls when application is submitted (this didn't change)

- the mapreduce application master and mapreduce job history server purely use the mapreduce job acls - this includes mapreduce.cluster.acls.enabled, mapreduce.cluster.administrators, acl-view-job, and acl-modify-job.

This separates out yarn from mapreduce so that someone could be admin for mapreduce without being yarn admin and when other apps are ported to yarn, they can be separate too.  The reason I don't have yarn admins apply to job history server is because the job history server is a mapreduce only component and shouldn't be looking at the yarn configs.

The only problem with this still is it appears the AM and job history server are using the job configuration so the user can override the settings - this is bad!! I need to investigate that more.

, I was unable to get rid of the inconsistencies without major rework.  I have put the mapreduce.cluster.admins back in for the AM and job history web services. the cli will still use the yarn acls.  I also fixed a bug in the history server checkAccess routine where it was first checking to see if security was on.

This message is automatically generated., Looked at the patch. Looks good. One minor nit - the debug log should be within an if debug enabled check.
Not necessarily related to this patch - yarn has ACLs enabled by default, MR has them disabled by default. That can lead to strange behavior considering some of the calls like killJob use Yarn ACLs, while getJobStatus will use MR ACLs. The Yarn ACLs could be disabled by default as well.
, Thanks for the review Sid.  I'll update the patch with the debug call changed. I will also go ahead and turn the yarn acls off by default to so they match mapred settings.

All the cli commands should be consistent - they all use the yarn acls. They all go through the invoke->getProxy() path which gets an application report, which does the yarn acl checks. 

But yes if yarn acls are on and mapred acls are off, it will still check yarn acls and enforce them when viewing/killing a mapred job via the cli, but if you go through the web apps it won't check acls because it only uses the mapred acls.
