[This error is simply stating that a map output file could not be found.  That can happen if the disk goes bad, something like tmpwatch is coming along and cleaning things up when it shouldn't, etc.  It is not in itself indicative of a problem in Hadoop unless you have supporting evidence for that.  Is this reproducible or are there other things that indicate there is something Hadoop itself can do to prevent this?  If not then this is more like a user support request which is better served by the [Hadoop mailing lists|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html].  JIRA is for tracking known problems in Hadoop itself and not for general support., thx, Closing this since it does not appear to be a problem in Hadoop.  Please reopen with additional evidence if you find otherwise.]
