[Attached an patch to the capacity scheduler web services tests that demonstrates the problem., Seems like the Java object structure is just fine. The JSON converter is having trouble because of circularl list references. Attaching patch to work around issue by creating a list class encapsulating the ArrayList of queueInfo objects.

This message is automatically generated., Forgot to 'svn add' a file, Attaching patch with new file and listing in JAXBContext.java, 
can you change the name so that we get:  queues : { queue:[] }.  That way we get an array of queue objects it matches the other outputs for apps/jobs/etc..   

Also can you please update the documentation - ./hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/ResourceManagerRest.apt.vm and check the intro one too please.
