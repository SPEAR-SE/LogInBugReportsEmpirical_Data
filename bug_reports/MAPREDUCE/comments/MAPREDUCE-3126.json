[Thomas, could glean anything from the logs?

Also, can you check if any NM was 'lost' i.e. crashed - there is corner-case with headroom calculations when cluster-capacity changes, I'm wondering if that was the cause here?, Sorry, haven't got back to this but have the logs saved off, will look later today., I didn't see any reference to lost/removed nodes in the RM log. Looking at the other logs to see if I can get anymore useful info on this., I'll fix the CS corner case at least with this jira..., Patch to fix corner case in CS., +1 overall.
