[Attaching a patch. The cause is due to ambiguity in where the staging directory is when using default stating dir configuration, i.e. /tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging. In my environment, the test does not run on C drive. Thus the MiniMRYarn cluster will refer to D:/tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging. AM still runs on C drive and refers to C:/tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging as staging directory, and cannot find job files that should be localized to staging directory., Attach a trunk patch. Please ignore the previous branch-2 patch, which does not work. The trunk patch should be able to apply to branch-2 as well., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
