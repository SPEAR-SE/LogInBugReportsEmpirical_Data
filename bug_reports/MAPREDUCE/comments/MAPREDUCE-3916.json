[{quote}Setting yarn.web-proxy.address to match yarn.resourcemanager.address doesn't disable the proxyserver (althought not setting yarn.web-proxy.address at all correctly disable it and produces a message: org.apache.hadoop.yarn.YarnException: yarn.web-proxy.address is not set so the proxy will not run). This contradicts the documentation provided for yarn.web-proxy.address in yarn-default.xml{quote}
 If we don't set 'yarn.web-proxy.address', then the proxy server will not start as separate process and start up fails with the message 'org.apache.hadoop.yarn.YarnException: yarn.web-proxy.address is not set so the proxy will not run' and proxy will run as part of the RM.

 If we give the value for 'yarn.web-proxy.address' which matches to the 'yarn.resourcemanager.address' then proxy server start up fails with "Address already in use". And also it is not starting as part of the RM. It is not as per the documentation. I have modified the description for this property accordingly.

Setting yarn.web-proxy.address and running the service results in the following:

I have added the 'hadoop-yarn-common\src\main\resources\webapps\proxy' dir with .keep file in it to resolve this problem as done for other components., +1. built/deployed pseudo cluster, set yarn.web-proxy.address and proxy started successfully, -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Devaraj. I had to manually create the proxy/.keep file as the patch command ignored it. Committed to trunk and branch-2, Thanks a lot Alejandro for reviewing and verifying the patch.

, Alejandro, all I see in this patch is just a change in the description in yarn-default.xml. How does this solve the problem? If it is just a doc update, should the title of this jira be updated?, Hi Suresh,

The patch attached here may have ignored the dotfile. The change can be properly seen at http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1307413 so its not a doc-only fix., Maybe svn add was not done before creating the patch? Since Jenkins did not have the right patch, hopefully this did not cause any issues. ]
