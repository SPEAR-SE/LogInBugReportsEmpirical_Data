Files passed using -file option are packaged into a jar and unjarred on the computing node. So, it wont preserve the execute permissions on the file.

There's no obvious reason it shouldn't.  Jar files are zipfiles, and at least the ant-built ones are created using Info-ZIP's zip (or something based on it), which preserves Unix perms for every file.  For example, here's one of the directories in my hadoop-common/build/hadoop-common-0.22.0-SNAPSHOT.jar:

If the corresponding Unix unzip were used to do the unpacking, the Unix perms would be restored correctly.  (UID/GID could be stored and recovered, as well, but that requires an extra option on each end and a privileged [root] user to do the unpacking.)]
