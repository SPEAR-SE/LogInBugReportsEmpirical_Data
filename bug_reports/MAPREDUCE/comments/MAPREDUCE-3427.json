[The tests failing are excluded in the streaming POM, once fixed they should be removed from the exclusion list., TestStreamingStatus issue is the same as MAPREDUCE-3409, I am also seeing:

{noformat}, Mahadev,

the tests you are see failing, those were tweaked and passing with HADOOP-7590. Would you check if any of those changes have been mistakenly reverted?, @Mahadev, those tests should likely work if JAVA_HOME is set in your environment., I think TestStreamingBadRecords is failing because the container launch is not handling special chars when generating/executing the launch container shell script. 

launchContainer: [bash, -c, /Users/Hitesh/dev/hadoop-common/hadoop-tools/hadoop-streaming/target/org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ClusterMapReduceTestCase$ConfigurableMiniMRCluster/org.apache.hadoop.mapred.ClusterMapReduceTestCase$ConfigurableMiniMRCluster-localDir-nm-1_2/usercache/Hitesh/appcache/application_1327200233613_0001/container_1327200233613_0001_01_000001/default_container_executor.sh]

Will file a separate jira for that. , TestUlimit seems to be failing as ulimit is not supported in mrv2. Likewise for StreamingBadRecords as skipping bad records is also not supported. 

Will open a separate jira for the above with respect to either cleaning up the configuration settings or more clearly documenting which configs are not supported. Will provide a patch shortly for commenting out the tests - depending on whether ulimit or skip bad records will/will not be supported, the test files could just be removed from svn. 

TestStreamingCombiner seems to work in my local env. Anyone else still seeing it fail?   , Patch to comment out testulimit and teststreamingbadrecords tests. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 8 new or modified tests.

This message is automatically generated., Hitesh, just use @Ignore for the tests?, @Arun - the patch does use @Ignore for the ones that use junit annotations. For TestStreamingBadRecords that derives off another class ( which in turn extends TestCase ), I had to comment out the tests themselves.  , Got it, +1., I just committed this.
