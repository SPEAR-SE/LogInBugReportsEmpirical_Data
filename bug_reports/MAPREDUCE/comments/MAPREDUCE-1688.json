[Clearly, one job's notification shouldn't affect another's - so we will need separate threads for each notification(from a thread pool?). We should also put caps on the {{retry.attempts}} and {{retry.interval}}. We should also log when a notification is finally sent out successfully., @Vinod : Can't we set the maximum amount of time an HttpMethod can wait when we create it in JobEndNotifier.httpNotification() ? Perhaps using the parameters defined in http://hc.apache.org/httpclient-3.x/preference-api.html ?

, This has been fixed by MAPREDUCE-3028. Since each AM is now doing the job-end notification, it has automatically been parallelized. Also, timeouts have been set in the HttpURLConnection object., Closing correctly as a duplicate., MAPREDUCE-3028 only added timeout setting in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.JobEndNotifier.
Would you apply timeout setting to org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobEndNotifier for MRv1 users?]
