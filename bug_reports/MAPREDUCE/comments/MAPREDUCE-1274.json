[bq. the web ui for MapReduce in 0.21.0-dev include a path to a local file in the url: 
The web ui url for retired jobs and history url have this. 

bq. I suspect the answer is applying MAPREDUCE-1185 back to 0.21.
MAPREDUCE-1185 does not solve the above mentioned problem. It only redirects the job url to history url. I think one solution is MAPREDUCE-323, where job history file depends only on jobid., Downgraded from blocker, following offline discussion with Arun. The first 0.21 release is not expected to have a fully-complete security implementation.]
