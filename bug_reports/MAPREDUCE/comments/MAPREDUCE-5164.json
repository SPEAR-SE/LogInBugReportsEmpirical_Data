This message is automatically generated., No test case added as it is a script change., +1 for the patch.  I applied it locally and tested by using HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS to set remote debugging JVM options when launching the "job", "queue", and "pipes" commands.  Thanks, [~nemon]!, Change into the same way as HADOOP-8623 does., Notice that JobHistoryServer is also in this script,this patch is invalid.Changing back again.Sorry for that., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
