This message is automatically generated., Have you run the ant tests with this?, I've run some, not all. I can run the full suite - does Hudson QA bot no longer do that?, One property missing in this. "mapreduce.shuffle.port", No, without mavnenization it isn't run by the QA bot., mapreduce.shuffle.port is still used by Yarn.  It was not changed and is still used by the Shuffle AuxService., Do you have any indication that the non-maven tests are passing on trunk as-is? I'm getting a few failures, but they don't seem related to this patch. Maybe we should add a hudson build for "ant test" on trunk?, The following tests failed with this patch:

Let me see their status on a non-patched trunk on my machine., Patch that revises on Todd's earlier patch and addresses Todd's TODOs as well (with proper, manual research).

Also fixed all refs to TT/JT to point to the MR AM instead, where applicable., P.s. Patch does not carry any modifications to the $MR_ROOT/src/test/mapred-site.xml as the original did, and the new mapred-default.xml location is actually under hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/resources/mapred-default.xml.

The src directory is useless at the moment and unused, being the reason., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Can someone look into this soon please? Helps avoid quite a few warnings and removes stale docs. Todd/Arun/others?, I did a quick look through the changes, and the tests pass so I am +1 on the change as is.

Are there any JIRAs to deprecate the configs from where they reside in the code? ./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/server/jobtracker/JTConfig.java for example. I know we cannot delete them out just yet, because MRV1 code still exists and may be using it, but it would be good to mark all of those configs as deprecated. So that we can delete them in trunk once the MRV1 code is completely removed.  A separate JIRA is fine for that, which is why I am still +1 on the original patch., Thanks Robert, rebased the patch. Will commit once I get a new +1 from jenkins., Filed MAPREDUCE-4692 to address the mentioned source-side of concern., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
