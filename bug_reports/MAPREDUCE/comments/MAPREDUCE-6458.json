[Re-assigning this to me and updating the description to reflect reality, since I actually understand how bash works., bq. Re-assigning this to me and updating the description to reflect reality, since I actually understand how bash works.
Please feel free to take it if you have bandwidth to work on it immediately., -00:
* MAPREDUCE-6454 but with HADOOP_CLASSPATH renamed to the not-already-used HADOOP_TASK_CLASSPATH
* added finalize code for HADOOP_TASK_CLASSPATH via a new hadoop_add_task_classpath function.
* hadoop_add_task_classpath safely verifies the path is valid, puts it in a decent place order-wise, etc, etc
* added shell unit tests for hadoop_add_task_classpath
* modified shell unit tests for hadoop_finalize_classpath
* added HADOOP_TASK_CLASSPATH to hadoop-config.cmd for Windows, \\
