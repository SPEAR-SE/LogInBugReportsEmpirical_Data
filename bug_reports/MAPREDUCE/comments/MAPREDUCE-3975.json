[Good catch Eric!

We should fix YarnChild to set this for back-compat., @Arun,

I modified YarnChild.configureLocalDirs(...) to mimic what JobLocalizer.createWorkDir(...) did in 20.205. Namely, to use the LocalDirAllocator to get a local path within one of the "mapreduce.cluster.local.dir" locations and create a scratch directory under it.

TESTING:
On a 10-node secure cluster, I ran manual tests to make sure that the "mapreduce.job.local.dir" was being set and that the directory was being created.

My manual tests printed the value of "job.local.dir" which showed up in the task logs. I also made sure that the scratch directories existed and were writeable by the user.

The 20.205 value for "job.local.dir" looked something like this:
  ${mapred.local.dir[x]}/taskTracker/$user/jobcache/$jobid/work
  e.g.: /cluster/0/tmp/mapred-local/taskTracker/joe/jobcache/job_1234_0001/work
The 23 value for "mapreduce.job.local.dir" looks something like this:
  ${mapreduce.cluster.local.dir[x]}/usercache/$user/appcache/$appid/work
  e.g.: /cluster/2/tmp/mapred-local/usercache/joe/appcache/application_5678_0002/work

CONCERN:
This solution works as far as it goes. However, I do have one concern.

In 20.205, it appears that the "job.local.dir" has the same parent dir (e.g. /cluster/0) for all of the task attempts that are run on a specific node. However, this is not the case in 23. That is, on 23, even if two task attempts are run on the same node for application_5678_0002, they could have different root directories (e.g., one task attempt would have /cluster/2 for its root dir and the other would have /cluster/4).

Is this expected behavior, or is YarnChild the wrong place to set this value?
, I think that it is fine to have them in different base directories, if it becomes a problem in practice because tasks are trying to share data with each other, then it can be fixed then., One minor nit.  There is a java.util.Random added in that is not needed.  I can fix it though as part of the commit. +1 assuming Jenkins comes back OK., Oh and I don't think we need the commented out code that used the Random. I can delete that too., bq.

, Thanks Bobby!, Sorry for coming late on this:

bq. I think that it is fine to have them in different base directories, if it becomes a problem in practice because tasks are trying to share data with each other, then it can be fixed then.
This is exactly what the job.local.dir is intended for - sharing of data across tasks on the node. If the tasks only need scratch space, they can write in ./tmp directory which is already created by nodemanager. Even our documentation for the 20.**/1.** release lines explicitly says this.

We need to fix it. I am reopening this ticket., Thanks Arun. Can you please give me pointers where this config property should be set in order to ensure that it is the same for different task attempts on the same node?

, Vinod, can we open a new JIRA for this?

The patch has already been merged in, and it is a step closer to what we want, although obviously not all the way there.  If the directories are not the same the worst thing that happens is that some resources are wasted. There are no guarantees that the tasks will run on the same node, so any mapreduce jobs that use this need to be able to handle a task running by itself., s/Arun/Vinod/g

Sorry about that., bq. There are no guarantees that the tasks will run on the same node, so any mapreduce jobs that use this need to be able to handle a task running by itself.
The feature helps to share resources on a node, whatever tasks run on this node can access this, more like the private distributed cache.

bq. can we open a new JIRA for this?
Sure, let me close this and open a new ticket., Created MAPREDUCE-3988.]
