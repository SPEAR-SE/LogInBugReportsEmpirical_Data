This message is automatically generated., The test failure is unrelated to this patch. It fails without the patch as well. I've filed https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4787, The change looks fine to me.  My only comment is that I would prefer to see mapreduce.job.end-notification.url have no default value in mapred-default.xml instead of having it be commented out.  When it is commented out then it will not appear in the generated documentation for the file., All right Bobby!

This message is automatically generated., Better, but the value of mapreduce.job.end-notification.url needs to be removed or commented out.  I can do that when I check it in. +1, Oh I forgot to mention that I ran the tests that failed manually and they passed for me.  I am not really sure what happened there.  They look like there are some races in those tests., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3003 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3003/])
