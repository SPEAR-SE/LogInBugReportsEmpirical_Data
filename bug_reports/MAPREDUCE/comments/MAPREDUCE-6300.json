bq. Not sure if that 134KB patch in YARN-3323 really fixed the problem.
The 134KB patch fixed the problem, however, actually it enabled auto detection instead of using {{sType}} and caused MAPREDUCE-6309. I'm thinking the 2KB patch is better., Committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.7. Thanks [~l201514] for the contribution., I think the bug is that parseHadoopId does not return a numeric value.

, bq. I think the bug is that parseHadoopId does not return a numeric value. There are other usages hinting to the same.
I found two usages which regard the return value of parseHadoopId as numeric, however, the methods are never called.
* {{AppAttemptPage#getContainersTableColumnDefs()}}
* {{AppPage#getAttemptsTableColumnDefs()}}, Thanks [~jira.shegalov] for the comment. Now function {{parseHadoopId}} just to remove HTML tags. For example, {{<a href='/jobhistory/task/task_1428681106131_0001_m_000026'>task_1428681106131_0001_m_000026</a>}} will be parsed into {{task_1428681106131_0001_m_000026}}.
We can parse {{task_1428681106131_0001_m_000026}} again to get numeric value {{000026}} and sort by the value, however, it looks a bit complex for me. Hi [~jira.shegalov], is there any specific reason to sort by numeric value?, I assume numeric repesentation it is done to be able to sort correctly even when dealing with padded vs unpadded or otherwise differently formatted strings.


There are more occurrences, it's inconsistent to fix it only in one place.  I am leaning to -1 to revert this patch until this is clarified.  [~jlowe]?

{code}, bq. I assume numeric repesentation it is done to be able to sort correctly even when dealing with padded vs unpadded or otherwise differently formatted strings.
I'm thinking this issue happened because numeric representation cannot sort correctly when dealing with differently formatted strings.

bq. There are more occurrences, it's inconsistent to fix it only in one place. I am leaning to -1 to revert this patch until this is clarified.
Agree with you that this patch is inconsistent. I'm okay to revert this patch.
