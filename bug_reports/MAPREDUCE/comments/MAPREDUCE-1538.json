But if we do df on the machine, we found the space is not an issue. It is because of the number of subdirectories are too high.
, +1, In the patch, we track the number of subdirectories and if it goes up to a threshold, we delete the released cache.
Similar mechanism is there for the total size. So we just adapt from that., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

It is not related to this patch., Code look good. I will commit this patch, Thanks for the help, Dhruba :), resubmit for HadoopQA, One comment:

{noformat}
+      long allowedNumberSubDir = conf.getLong(
+          TTConfig.TT_LOCAL_CACHE_SUBDIRS_LIMIT, DEFAULT_CACHE_SUBDIR_LIMIT);
{noformat}

We should save the variable from the conf rather than read it from the conf each time.
, Also, I'd propose we have a single data-structure to track sizes and #sub-dirs for a given basedir rather than 2 separate maps. Something along the lines of:

{code}
static class CachedDir {
  long size;
  long subdirs;
}
{code}, Arun: Both your suggestions are really good. I will make the change. We also have:

{code:xml} 
      // setting the cache size to a default of 10GB
      long allowedSize = conf.getLong(TTConfig.TT_LOCAL_CACHE_SIZE,
          DEFAULT_CACHE_SIZE);
{code} 

Inside getLocalCache(), I will also save this variable according to your suggestion., 1. Move reading config to the constructor
2. Use a class to store cache directory properties, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
