[It's a little confusing,if mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.completedmaps didn't control when reduce will start scheduling,should we just remove this parameter? or maybe change name to mapreduce.job.reduce.slowstart.startedmaps?, As I understand it, this functionality works properly in Hadoop 1.0, so that reducers do not start until the requisite number of map tasks have completed.  In 0.23/2.0 that's not the case, and we need to correct that behavior rather than rename existing properties to match an undesired behavior., this is mainly for small jobs,isn't it?the time frame between started map and completed map job will affect the small job's latency,if that's the case,why not just remove this parameter,what's the difference if we set it to 0.33 and 1.0?we didn't prevent other reduce to locate,isn't it?, This is mostly about the utilization of the cluster.  In many cases you have a map/reduce job where the mappers take a very long time.  If you don't wait until all of the mappers have finished there are many many reducers taking up resources doing nothing waiting for the mappers to finish.  In some cases we have seen this last from several hours up to a day or two., Patch to verify we've met the slowstart criteria before unleashing all reducers once all maps have been assigned.

Besides the automated tests that were added/modified, I also ran manual tests on a local cluster with sleep and wordcount jobs., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
