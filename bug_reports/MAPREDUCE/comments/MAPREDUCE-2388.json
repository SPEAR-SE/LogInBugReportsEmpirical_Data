[It seems there are a few classes of tasks that have no locality info:

a) tasks that truly have no input at all (eg "sleep job" or teragen)
b) tasks with input splits pointing to an external system (eg S3, or DBInputFormat)
c) tasks pointing to HDFS files where the InputFormat implementer hasn't properly provided split locations

Are there other examples I'm not thinking of?

The tradeoff of considering these types of tasks local is that they might take a slot where some other task could actually get some benefit from being local. But considering them non-local slows down their scheduling, and may even cause starvation if there are always local tasks available as slots open up.
