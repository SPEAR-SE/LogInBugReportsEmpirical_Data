[Hi, do you have more details about the exception? For example, Mapreduce AM log and RM log., JIRA is for developers to track issues. It is a good idea to discuss this on the user list till we zero-in on a particular issue with the code, before creating a JIRA. , I'd flag up JRockit as trouble too -try to replicate on oracle java 6 or java7 from oracle or openjdk]
