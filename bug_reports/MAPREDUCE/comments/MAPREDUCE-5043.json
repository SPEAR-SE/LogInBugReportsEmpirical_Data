[One approach to fixing this is to have {{TaskAttempt}} provide a cheap interface for getting just the phase.  The fetch failure processing can then compute the total number of reducers in the shuffle phase *before* iterating through the maps with fetch failures rather than computing it redundantly for each map attempt., Patch to implement the proposed approach.  No unit tests since this is an optimization.

Did some rudimentary performance testing on a sleep job with 1000 maps and 1000 reduces and forcing the reducer's Fetcher to always fail.  With this job profile fetch failure processing appears to be well over 10x faster.  Before the patch processing a fetch failure for this job profile took around 10msec per map attempt in the event.  After the patch the processing a single map attempt in a fetch failure event was well less than a millisecond, and processing 30+ map attempts was taking around 1 millisecond total., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
