[The issue exists not just for elapsed time but also for elapsed time shuffle, elapsed time merge and elapsed time reduce., I think what's going on here is that the filter on time is searching on both the text data of the cell as well as title. I think the intention is to sort by hidden element title and filter based on text data of the cell., This patch removes sorting/filter by title except for task id. Now they are sorted by cell text data, looks like it needs to be sorted numerically, but just on seconds, not on milliseconds, This issue exists on many of the web pages that display elapsed time, -1 overall.

Manual tests include testing that tables are sorted correctly and that filter and search terms return correct results for all tables that have an elapsed time column.
, This will still end up being an issue for long running jobs. The displayed time will contain 'hrs', 'mins' and 'sec' - and the 'title' value will always be in seconds. Is there some way to prevent the 'title' being part of the search ? (The search on the name field in the TasksPage is also broken - due to the link being part of the search), Good point, Sid. Despite many tries, I have not found a way to separate the sort and search. I will post a question to the datatables forum and see if that turns up any results., Canceling patch to address issues, Solution was more fundamental than I supposed.

Solution was found here.
