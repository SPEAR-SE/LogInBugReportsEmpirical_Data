[split.dta is created by MapTask(non job-setup non job-cleanup) during task localization in TaskTracker (MapTask.localizeConfiguration()). A search in the trunk shows that this file is not used anywhere. The split information needed is serialized everywhere (TaskTracker/Task/Child) and so is available in memory wherever it is needed. A search in project history split.dta reveals that this is being added in HADOOP-451, but its original uses no longer seem to be there.

Is the creation of split.dta stale and can it be removed?

If not used anywhere, I am planning to remove it as part of the DefaultTaskController related changes in HADOOP-4491, making some of the code changes there a bit clean., In an offline chat with Amareshwari, we realized that split.dat is used by IsolationRunner. Closing this issue as won't fix. Will just put a comment about it's usage as part of HADOOP-4491.]
