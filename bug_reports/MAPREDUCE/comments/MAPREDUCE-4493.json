[I'm not sure we want to inherit *exactly* the same behaviour here... we could document this as an incompatibility for MR, but this seems the right thing to do for YARN., If that is what you want to do I am fine with that.  We can drop the severity in that case.  If so we need to deprecate the usage of many of the distributed cache APIs that will not working properly in many cases.  I am a little curious how distributed cache works on the windows branch as Windows does not support true symlinks.  If we are deprecating the use of the LocalCache(Files|Archives) I just want to be sure that we are not making it overly difficult for Hadoop to work on windows, or if this is going to be something that we will have to undo later on when windows support comes to 2.0., Dropping severity because this is just going to be a configuration change., Sorry I meant documentation not configuration., This patch deprecates the configs and functions associated with turning symlinks on.  It also updates the docs., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., CombineFileInputFormat has been failing for a while.  The new Javac warnings are because of deprecation of some of the APIs., One minor nit, it might be nice to add a comment by getLocalCacheArchives and getLocalCacheFiles as to why they were deprecated.

Otherwise looks good.  +1., Will do, Added in the comments., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, [~revans2] if we are deprecating getLocalCacheFiles and getCacheFiles in jobContext() then how the user is going to get local cached files in map task?  YARN-916 is the related issue.. Thanks., [~ojoshi] By opening the symbolic link in the current working directory.

Prior to YARN the default behavior was to not create symlinks in the current working directory pointing to the items in the distributed cache.  If you wanted links you had to specifically turn that option on and provide the name of the symlink you wanted.  The only way to get to files without symlinks was to call getLocalCacheFiles and getCacheFiles.  In YARN all files will have a symlink created.  The name of the file/directory will be the name of the symlink.  However, it is possible to have a name collision where I wanted hdfs://foo/bar.zip and hdfs://bar/bar.zip.  In 1.0 both of these would have been downloaded and accessible through the deprecated APIs, but in YARN a warning will be output and only one of them will be downloaded.  Also because of the way these APIs were written the mapper code may not know that only one of them was downloaded and will not be able to find the missing one and blow up.  That is why I deprecated them in favor of nudging people to always use the symlinks so the behavior is always consistent., [~revans2] sounds good.. however by this we will be putting limitation based on file name ..but that sounds reasonable considering the fact that this will stop potential bugs in map code and users can definitely version them to avoid it...
