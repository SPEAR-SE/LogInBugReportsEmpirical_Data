[Updating summary since the provided stacktrace is from TestMRJobs and not TestUberAM.

I'm not able to reproduce this locally, and the recent Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk builds haven't reported this failure.  Are there output logs from a failed run?, I've observed a number of jenkins builds in this month that have the same failure, for example,

* https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/3198/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/3087/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/3078/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-YARN-Build/3160/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1701/
* https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1707/

Therefore, I'm guessing it is a reproducible test failure.
, Thanks for the pointers to the failures, Zhijie.  It looks like it might be a case where an AM ran, generated 8 logs, but the test code didn't notice they were AM logs and thought it was looking for task logs (hence expecting 4 instead of 8).

[~jira.shegalov] could you take a look?, [~jlowe] I am already tracking this. We have not seen this on our jenkins. I'll look into making the ut more robust., actual 8 is the correct number. The test picks expected 4 because it wrongly assumes a task container log. The only reason I see is that the log rolled past the lines mentioning the MRAppMaster. With this patch, job.isUber and containerId == 1 is used for a simpler/robuster check. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
