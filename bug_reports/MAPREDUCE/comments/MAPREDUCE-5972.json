This message is automatically generated., IMO, I'm a bit uncomfortable about this going into branch-2 since it changes a typo in a parameter.  

But we should fix it nonetheless.

, job.xml is generated automatically by MapReduce framework, so users don't set the parameter 'programmatically'. However, users will affected if
# they are using a script to parse job.xml and search 'programatically'
# they are using a program to verify the resource of the configuration
I'll mark this issue as incompatible change and moving target version to 3.0.0., +1. Committed to trunk!
