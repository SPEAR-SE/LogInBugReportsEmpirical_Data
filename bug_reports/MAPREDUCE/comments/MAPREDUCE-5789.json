This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Rushabh!  Looks good overall, just some minor nits:

- The test should use values such that the expected value is unique to the average rather than also being valid if just one task's reduce time is returned instead.  Both tasks have the exact same times, and it would be nice if this could catch a regression in the average computation.
- Please format the code to 80 columns
- Extra whitespace at the end of the test, Thanks Jason for the comments.
