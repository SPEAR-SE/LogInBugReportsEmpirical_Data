[What is the use-case that you are trying to solve that requires running/waiting number of map/reduce tasks? In YARN, you will probably only have access to the total no. of containers running across all application types. The scheduler apis may be able to surface the total of pending asks ( which would translate into waiting containers ) I believe. , The usecase is to show on Ambari UI the information written in description., MR2 applications are too split up to have a central place where their metrics can be gathered. Job history server cannot give real time MR2 metrics. Since this is long term work, this particular issue is being resolved.  ]
