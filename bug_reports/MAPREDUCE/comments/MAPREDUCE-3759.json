This message is automatically generated., +1 Tested the patch on a cluster with unhealthy nodes and saw that it returned correct list of nodes. 
However the unhealthy node is being listed under the active node list too. Probably same as MAPREDUCE-3760?, It looks like Oracle finally turned off the old javadoc package list API. and we are all hitting http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MJAVADOC-300 which is causing your one javadoc warning.  I will file a JIRA to update this., Patch looks good. Committing now., I just committed this. Thanks Vinod!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #480 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/480/])
