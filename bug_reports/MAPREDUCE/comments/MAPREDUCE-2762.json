This message is automatically generated., Mahadev - there are 2 calls to cleanupStagingDir - should we move the call to JobImpl.finished(JobState)? That way we do the cleanup in one place... ideally we'd have a single 'base transition' which called this., good idea. will take a look tomm morning., This works for most of the cases, but there is a corner condition - if the staging files are deleted and then AM crashes for whatever reason before it unregisters with the RM, AM restart is affected. RM will happily restart the AM but the AM cannot recover because of absent job-files.

I think we should do the cleanup as the last step of the MR AM(main() ? )., You are right Vinod.

Thinking abt this more, I think we should move the unregister call out of the stop() methods. We could make sure that as soon as unregister is called, we send an event back to JobImpl saying done with the RM, and then we can go ahead to delete the staging dir.

So, there'd be a state transition from 
 
RUNNING->SUCCEEDED that would sent an unregister event to RMCommunicator.
and then

SUCCEEDED -> SUCCEEDED in JobImpl, that would happen on an event triggered after unregister is called, and the same for Killed and Failed, which would delete the staging directory.

Do you guys see any issues with that? 


, @Vinod,
 Do you see any issues with the proposed soln?, It is simpler than that. Cleanup should always be the last step so that recovery is possible. The control always returns to MRAppMaster, we can override stop() in MRAppMaster and do the cleanup after stopping all the components (super.stop()) without adding any new events.

What do you think?, Changed the patch to do cleanup after calling stop on all services in MRAppMaster.

- Added a job cleanup event which is synchronously called from the MRAppMaster Jobfinished handler. 

We could also add a job api for cleanupo but either of those are not very clean implementation. The more I think, the earlier suggestion on sending events for de registering and then cleanup is probably much cleaner., Why can't we simply move the {{cleanupStagingDir()}} operation into MRAppMaster itself from the Job. In that case, we don't need this complex event handling from Job into MRAppMaster and then back into Job. Essentially
{code}
class MRAppMasster {
   ..... 

   @Override
   public void stop() {
      super.stop(); // Stop all services
      cleanupStagingDir(); // Cleanup the dir now.
   }
   .....
}
{code}

I get a feeling that there is a disconnect here and I may be missing something, am I?, Yeah had thought abt that. I was trying to keep the MRAppMaster code clean and did not want to inject any code from Jobs in the MRAppMaster. 
As Vinod tells me, the code is already tainted with the uber AM, so I'll go ahead and make the quick fix for cleaning the staging directories.
We'll have to rethink the MRAppMaster code when we do DAG of jobs in the AM., Updated patch will cleanup in MRAppMaster. Still doing some testing., Updated patch. Tested it on a cluster., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
