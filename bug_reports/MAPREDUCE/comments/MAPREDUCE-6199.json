, This was reverted and never added back. Reopening to set the right state as it isn't "fixed"., Uh sorry, the commit message timeline is confusing on this. This is indeed present in the trunk and branch-2.8/branch-2, was only reverted in branch-2.7. My bad - sorry for the noise - the addendum vs. 2.7 notes confused me :(
