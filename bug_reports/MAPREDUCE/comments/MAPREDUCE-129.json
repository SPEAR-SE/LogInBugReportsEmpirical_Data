[I'm marking this a blocker for 0.15.  I think we should find out how this could occur as it may have other sinister effects on the system., I'm downgrading this bug and moving it to 16 because it looks to be a race condition between submitting a job and bringing up the cluster., Looks like {{getNewJobId()}} in {{JobTracker}} doesnt check if the initialization is complete. Also this is fixed in 0.15., bq. Looks like getNewJobId() in JobTracker doesnt check if the initialization is complete
I meant in 0.14]
