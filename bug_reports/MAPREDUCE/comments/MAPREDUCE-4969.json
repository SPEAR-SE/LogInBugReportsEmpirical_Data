[windows is a lot fussier about open files than unix, which can unlink a file from the path while still keeping it open. Windows server is better than windows client, for extra fun., [~stevel@apache.org] You are right and this is Windows being fussier about closing in-use files. Happily this instance turns out to be a test bug. An input stream was not closed on exit.

Attached a fix and removed the workaround I put in place earlier with MAPREDUCE-4099., @Arpit: I'm always right., Is this not relevant to trunk?, Thanks Suresh, yes it is.
