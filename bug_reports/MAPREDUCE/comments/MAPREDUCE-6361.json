[NPE get throw in copyFailed() in ShuffleSchedulerImpl.java:267:
{code}
"boolean hostFail = hostFailures.get(hostname).get() > getMaxHostFailures() ? true : false;"
{code} 
It means hostFailures doesn't include hostname that just failed, which is not expected because we call hostFailed() to put host into hostFailures before anytime to call copyFailed():
{code}
        scheduler.hostFailed(host.getHostName());
        for(TaskAttemptID left: failedTasks) {
          scheduler.copyFailed(left, host, true, false);
        }
{code}
Although hostFailed() and copyFailed() are both synchronized method (so as copySucceeded()), it is still possible (like the only reason) to cause this NPE for the other thread calls copySucceeded() on the same host (for other map output) between we call hostFailed() and copyFailed() in this thread when taking care of one map output failure.
We need to fix this concurrent issue to get rid of NPE issue which failed map output copy directly without any retry., There are basically two ways to fix the race condition here:
1. abstract following code into a synchronized method, so copySucceeded() would get blocked until copyFailed() finished.
{code}
scheduler.hostFailed(host.getHostName());
for(TaskAttemptID left: failedTasks) {
    scheduler.copyFailed(left, host, true, false);
}
{code}
This sounds like more performance impact on shuffle as failure in fetching map output on one thread will block copySucceeded() for other threads with longer time.

2. Update copyFailed() to have assumption that hostFailures could be cleanup in the other thread. In case of that, adding back host to hostFailed as the first time host failed.

Prefer the 2nd option which sounds more lightweight. Will deliver a quick patch soon., Upload the patch with the 2nd solution proposed above with unit test., \\

, The patch applies to 2.6.0 cleanly., Pulled this into 2.6.1, after fixing a minor merge conflict in TestShuffleScheduler.

Ran compilation and TestShuffleScheduler before the push.]
