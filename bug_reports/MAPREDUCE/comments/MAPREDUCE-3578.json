[Chances are high that your jsvc is busted in some way or you are running in secure mode or something similar.  It might just need to be recompiled the proper bitness.  In any case "-jvm server" is a jsvc option used only when the daemon is run as root, thus why it is required for $EUID = 0.  "-server" is a JVM option and used when the daemon is run by not root. , These two jiras are relevant:
https://issues.cloudera.org/browse/DISTRO-252
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/DAEMON-208
, It is not advisable to start NodeManagers as root for security purposes. That applies for all of yarn/mapreduce daemons. Not sure why it was allowed to run as root. Could be a copy-paste bug.

If we allow root, he bug is still valid I suppose. 

BTW, none of yarn daemons use jsvc., Patch to remove jsvc options since jsvc isn't used by node managers (as Vinod pointed out)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
