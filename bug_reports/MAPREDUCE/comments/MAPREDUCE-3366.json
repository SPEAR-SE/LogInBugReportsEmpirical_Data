This message is automatically generated., Patch build didn't work for some other reasons, cancel patch and retest., For MR jobs to work properly with the above change, APPLICATION_CLASSPATH in ApplicationConstants.java will also likely need to be changed. , Updated patch for trunk with ApplicationConstants.java fixed., The same trunk patch can apply cleanly to 0.23 branch for now., Here are some issues with that patch:

* In hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/bin/yarn-config.sh :
Instead of using the hardcoded value "$bin/../", it would be eaiser to reuse what has been done in MAPREDUCE-3373.
For instance:
+DEFAULT_LIBEXEC_DIR="$bin"/../libexec
+HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR=${HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR:-$DEFAULT_LIBEXEC_DIR}
+if [ -e "${HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR}/hadoop-config.sh" ]; then
+  . "${HADOOP_LIBEXEC_DIR}/hadoop-config.sh"

* Wouldn't it be less confusing to display the message "hadoop-config.sh not found" instead of "Hadoop common not found." if hadoop-config.sh is not found?


* Why changing these lines:
-YARN_CONF_DIR="${YARN_CONF_DIR:-$YARN_HOME/conf}"
+YARN_CONF_DIR="${HADOOP_CONF_DIR:-$YARN_HOME/conf}

I would like to be able to specify a different YARN_CONF_DIR than HADOOP_CONF_DIR whole not being in YARN_HOME/conf. This change reduces the choices

bq. Why changing these lines:
bq. -YARN_CONF_DIR="${YARN_CONF_DIR:-$YARN_HOME/conf}"
bq. +YARN_CONF_DIR="${HADOOP_CONF_DIR:-$YARN_HOME/conf}

This was done as part of merging back Hadoop into a project.  There are many configuration files which have interconnected parts.  i.e. log4j, hadoop-metric2.properties.  It seems safer to consolidate config files back to
HADOOP_CONF_DIR, and reduce redundancies or conflicts.  For consistency, HDFS use HADOOP_CONF_DIR rather than
HDFS_CONF_DIR.  Yarn should follow the same pattern in my opinion.

Mahadev,  yes, this subsume MAPREDUCE-3177., Updated LIBEXEC to match what was done in MAPREDUCE-3373., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Regarding merging all configurations in HADOOP_CONF_DIR, this definitely makes sense.

Yes., @Eric,
 Could you please incorporate the documentation changes from MAPREDUCE-3416 as well? , Tried the patch, layout seems OK, after setting all necessary ENV variables as well as minimal *-site.xml files I was able to start all services and run an example MR job.

+1 (after comments from Eric are addressed), I am trying to get it tested on secure cluster, will update on how that goes. , @Eric, I tried setting up a secure cluster as I used to earlier, looks like YARN_HOME needs to be set now, which is fine. Earlier it used to work without it - I think YARN_HOME used to default to MAPRED_HOME. But I think we need to make sure our documentation is correct. Could you please update the documentation (single node/multi node setup) to be in sync with the latest binary layout and environment setup?, Mahadev, yes I will update the document for completeness.

Running through some final testing to see all if the builds are all fine. Will commit this tomm morning., Yikes.. looks like the documentation update is incorrect (related to symlink creation). Ill update that before committing. , In the new layout, there is no need to create symlink for yarn jar files in common directory.  I think the symlink section is no longer necessary with the new layout.  Therefore, I removed that section.  Could you be more specific about the flaws?  Thanks, @Eric,
 The symlink would still be needed if you were running bin/hadoop jar ... No? I dont think you can get away without creating the symlinks in that case. Though it would only be needed on the gateway node and not on the cluster nodes., Looks like I might be wrong on this. Let me run a cluster without doing any symlinks on the gateways. @Eric you might be right that we dont need any symlinks at all., @Mahadev,

Are the build procedures changing as a result of this JIRA?, @Eric P,
 The build procedure will still stay the same. Its just the structure of the tarball and the script locations will change.
