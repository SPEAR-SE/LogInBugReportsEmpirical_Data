[It looks like the latest jquery.dataTables.min.js (1.10.5) fixes this problem.  I'm not sure how to update that file., .js file and some other components are at {{hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/static/dt-1.9.4/}}. I'm thinking you can upload them to {{... /static/dt-1.10.5/}} and change the following code
{code:title=JQueryUI.java}
    html.
      link(root_url("static/jquery/themes-1.9.1/base/jquery-ui.css")).
      link(root_url("static/dt-1.9.4/css/jui-dt.css")).
      script(root_url("static/jquery/jquery-1.8.2.min.js")).
      script(root_url("static/jquery/jquery-ui-1.9.1.custom.min.js")).
      script(root_url("static/dt-1.9.4/js/jquery.dataTables.min.js")).
      script(root_url("static/yarn.dt.plugins.js")).
      style("#jsnotice { padding: 0.2em; text-align: center; }",
            ".ui-progressbar { height: 1em; min-width: 5em }"); // required

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~brahmareddy], thank you for updating the patch. 
1. Would you fix the audit warnings by updating the following section of the pom.xml in hadoop-yarn-common project?
{code}
            <exclude>src/main/resources/webapps/static/dt-1.9.4/css/jui-dt.css</exclude>
            <exclude>src/main/resources/webapps/static/dt-1.9.4/css/demo_table.css</exclude>
            <exclude>src/main/resources/webapps/static/dt-1.9.4/images/Sorting icons.psd</exclude>
{code}
2. I'm thinking {{demo_table.css}} can be removed.
Now I'm trying to confirm that this issue is fixed by your patch. I'll add a comment later.
(The findbugs warnings look unrelated to the patch.), Verified the patch fixed the issue. +1 if above two comments are reflected.

By the way sort by elapsed time does not work properly. (10 sec is regarded lower than 2 sec, it is confusing for users.) I'll file a jira for this., Filed MAPREDUCE-6309., Thanks a lot Akira for review.. I will update patch soon..., [~ajisakaa] updated the patch..Kindly review !!!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., I'm wondering how this is different than MAPREDUCE-6300 and why we need to update the jquery dependency to fix the issue.  I believe this used to work and apparently does work in other web pages (like task attempts), so I'm wondering if this is simply a problem with the javascript metadata for the task table., Thanks [~jlowe] for the comment. 
bq. I'm wondering if this is simply a problem with the javascript metadata for the task table.
I agree with you. Reading datatable document(https://datatables.net/upgrade/1.10-convert), {{sType}} has not been supported since 1.10. Therefore, after upgrading jquery dependency, the column type is detected automatically instead of using {{sType}}. This is because this issue is fixed. Now I'm +1 for fixing the metadata instead of upgrading the dependency., I'd like to close this issue as duplicate. Let's fix it in MAPREDUCE-6300., Fixed by MAPREDUCE-6301. Sorry for confusion., s/MAPREDUCE-6301/MAPREDUCE-6300/g]
