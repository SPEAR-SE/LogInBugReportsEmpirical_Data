[This is clearly the regular Jetty issue from MAPREDUCE-2386; still lurking.

Dmitry: the fix for this in Hadoop 2 was to take Jetty out of the process, otherwise it's going to happen. Some work went into trying to detect the problem in Hadoop 1.x -try running Hadoop 1.3 to see if that helps. Otherwise, there's nothing anyone can do except say "upgrade to Hadoop 2". Sorry, I see hadoop-2.2.0 also ships with jetty-6.1.26.jar?
, ..yes, but not used in the MapReduce shuffle, and getting rid of Jetty entirely is a goal of future work]
