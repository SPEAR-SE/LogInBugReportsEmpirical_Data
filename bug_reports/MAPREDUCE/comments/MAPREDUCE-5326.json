[I think, for now, we should just add name (mapreduce) & version (1.0.0) in the http response header and assert them in the fetcher.

Thoughts?

, More - we also need to add /v1/ to the shuffle request to be safe..., Good news is that we can add this in a follow-on release (2.1.1-beta)  without breaking existing apps etc.

I think that is the right soln. ATM, it's too close for comfort to muck around with this late in the game., Also, I think this is internal and so is safe to do beyond 2.1. It isn't directly exposed to client, only MR and may be TEZ. So.., The patch added the version info in both http request and response, and checked it on both sides as well. Related tests casses were modified and added.

One issue that need to be highlighted is what http response code should be return when the the version is incompatible. Currently, I return 400 in the patch. Any thoughts?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
