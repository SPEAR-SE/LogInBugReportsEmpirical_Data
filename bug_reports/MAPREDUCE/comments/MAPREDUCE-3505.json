[A possible way of addressing that is to push this classpath as part of configuration, where the default value will be the current value in ApplicationConstants.APPLICATION_CLASSPATH. This value can be then overridden (if needed) in the conf files.

What does bigtop want this to be?, My preference would be to avoid using configuration for this. Maybe we can detect the paths from the NM's classpath or some clever hack? Thus, we could avoid the hardcoding too..., @Arun,

yes it would be very nice if this can be auto-detected. Short of that, an alternative that would
avoid run-time configuration might be compile-time configuration (something like an autogenerated class a'la VersionInfo)., +1 to the patch.
It solves a big issue I have had to hack around. This patch makes it way better than the current situation and we can always improve it later on., +1 on the current patch. Can we, please, have it committed? I understand the interest in a more general solution, but committing this would be an incremental positive step., +1

@Arun, I agree that we should try to infer this somehow in an automatic why. Until we do so, would it be OK to have this patch as a temporary workaround? (effectively this patch is just moving the constructed classpath from being hardcoded in the Java code to be in the yarn config file)., Unless there are objections I'll be committing this patch later today., Seems fair. We should add a test case though. , Attaching an updated patch where a new test case is added to TestMRApps (Per Arun's comment). Thanks!, +1 overall.
