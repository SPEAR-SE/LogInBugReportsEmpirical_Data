[Oh so looking at the code a bit more, it also appears that if an error does happen the thread that writes to the log dies and the event queue then grows without bound, so technically there is a memory leak involved here too., This patch should also work on branch-2.  On branch-0.23 HADOOP-9196 will need to be applied first, but after that it works just fine there too., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks like a very stale patch. [~revans2], can you see if the patch still applies or can you upload a newer patch so we can get a +1 from HadoopQA?, [~mitdesai],

I really don't have a lot of time to devote to this right now.  If you are willing to wait I can try to take a look at upmerging, but it would probably be faster for someone else to take it if it is important to them. , \\
