This message is automatically generated., This issue cannot be resolved simply by capitalize 'd'.
I found that Job#getMapredJobID in MR1 returns 'String' but ControlledJob#getMapredJobId in MR2 returns 'JobID'.
In MR1, Job#getAssignedJobID returns 'JobID' instead.
So, I think the issue is resolved by renaming ControlledJob#getMapredJobId to ControlledJob#getAssignedJobID in MR2., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., In MAPREDUCE-5233, we intentionally changed ControlledJob#getMapredJobID to ControlledJob#getMapredJobId, because we wanted to add Job#getMapredJobID, which returns String, to be binary compatible to MR1. Therefore, it's already impossible for ControlledJob in MR1 and RM2 to have the same method name. I'm afraid changing getMapredJobId to another name doesn't help. In addition, this is an incompatible change again, where we struggled a lot ago., [~zjshen], thanks for the review. I don't want to make an incompatible change again. I think this issue should be "won't fix". [~sandyr], what do you think of this?, Since there was no comment for a month, I resolve this issue as won't fix.]
