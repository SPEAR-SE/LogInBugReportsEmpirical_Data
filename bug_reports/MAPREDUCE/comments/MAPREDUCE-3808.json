[This blocks scan benchmark (and possibly others like gridmix), Oh, and this is most likely caused by MAPREDUCE-3711., Rober, can you please take a crack at this one?, Sure I can look into it.  It appears that for some reason mapreduce.output.fileoutputformat.outputdir is not set in the config.

, OK I am a bit confused here.  Why is it allowed to run a map only job that does not have an output directory set?  The FileOutputFormat blows up if there are any reduces and the output directory is not set, but for a map only job it is fine.  What is supposed to happen in that situation?  I can replicate it, but I don't know what the previous behavior was., Well looking at the rest of the code it looks like the FileOutputCommitter becomes a NOOP when the output dir is not set, so I need to replicate that here too., This patch should fix the issue.  It adds in a check for null on the output in several places when building paths and short curcits those methods to return null.  It also adds in the a null output check in recoverTask and causes it to be a noop when output is null.  Finally it adds in tests to validate that the FileOutputCommitter handles that case correctly. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
