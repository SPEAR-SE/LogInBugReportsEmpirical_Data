[It looks like MAPREDUCE-2908. Fix all findbugs warnings. It removed displayJobList from JobClient., oops, I was wrong that isn't causing the problem, still investigating., this only occurs with clean .m2 .ivy, if you have one already populate you might not see the error.  I see the error both on trunk and branch23., My original comment was right about displayJobList from JobClient. 

In order for it to pick up the change you have to remove the old jar from the .ivy directory first, which seems broken also., Thomas, pls go ahead an upload a fix, thanks., attached patch but need to see if it causes findbugs since that is presumably why it was originally rel, Yes, this is because of MAPREDUCE-2908, I take the blame. I removed the method as FindBugs warned that method wasn't properly overridden because of a different argument - something of that sort. The removed method JobClient.displayJobList() and CLI.displayJobList() are essentially the same code.

The attached patch will bring that warning back. We should just change the visibility of CLI.displayJobList() to be public., change routine to be public.  builds, waiting on test-patch., testpatch found findbugs warning although it wasn't introduced by this change - fixing and waiting for test-patch again.

NP 	Possible null pointer dereference of appMaster in org.apache.hadoop.mapred.YARNRunner.submitJob(JobID, String, Credentials)
	

Bug type NP_NULL_ON_SOME_PATH (click for details)
In class org.apache.hadoop.mapred.YARNRunner
In method org.apache.hadoop.mapred.YARNRunner.submitJob(JobID, String, Credentials)
Value loaded from appMaster
Dereferenced at YARNRunner.java:[line 253]
Known null at YARNRunner.java:[line 251], thomas,
 Sorry to pick on this. Minor nit, Can we do this?

{code}
String appDiagnostics = (app.getDiagnostics() == null? "Diagnostics Unavailable" ? app.getDiagnostics())
throw new IOException(.... + appDiagnostics)
{code}

Its just getting rid of multiple throws.

This message is automatically generated., actually never mind, I was wrong., ok, I personally wasn't super fond of that change either but it fixed the findbugs for now.  Seems like that code should retry or try to return some better error in the null case.  ok if I file a followup Jira so we can get the build unblocked?, yup, i think its good for now., Made a minor change to the patch for not duplication the throws clause., -1 overall.
