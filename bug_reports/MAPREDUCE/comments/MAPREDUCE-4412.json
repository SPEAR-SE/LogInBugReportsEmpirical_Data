[Thanks for filing this Pavan. Will you be contributing a fix for this as well? We can at least add in a blank mapred-site.xml, although the only usual config needed to be done by users, is to set "mapreduce.framework.name" to "yarn", to run against YARN (Via MR2)., Please use target versions to indicate which future versions you'd like the fix to go in. Use the Fix versions only if the fix is already committed to such a version., Moved to project MAPREDUCE as it is relevant to that, not to Common (HADOOP)., Oh I didn't get by what the fix versions meant while filling. Sure will keep that in mind.
Also while I was setting up a single node Hadoop 2nd generation using this link
http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/r0.23.1/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/ClusterSetup.html#SingleCluster
I found out that not only mapred-site.xml but another file i.e hadoop-env.sh is also required.
Please correct me if I am wrong. Do we have to set JAVA_HOME in both hadoop-env.sh and yarn.env.sh ?]
