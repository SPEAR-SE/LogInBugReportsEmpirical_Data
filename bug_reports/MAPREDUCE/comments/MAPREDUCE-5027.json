[AFAIK there is no built-in way to have Netty automatically limit the number of active client connections.  A quick search on the net indicates one way this is handled is to simply close the extra connections as soon as they are created once we get past a specified number of active connections., The following may be handy: https://issues.jboss.org/browse/NETTY-311, netty seems to be more geared to limit connections per IP.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch Rob. There seems to be a race condition in the testMaxConnections test. 

On my desktop I get two different results consistently.

First: 
Failed tests:   testMaxConnections(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestShuffleHandler): expected:<2> but was:<1>

Second:
Tests in error: 
  testSerializeMeta(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestShuffleHandler): test timed out after 2000 milliseconds
  testShuffleMetrics(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestShuffleHandler): test timed out after 2000 milliseconds
  testClientClosesConnection(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestShuffleHandler): test timed out after 2000 milliseconds
  testMaxConnections(org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestShuffleHandler): test timed out after 2000 milliseconds
, John,
I modified the test to try to open numerous connections and then verify the max is not reached.  Thus eliminating the need do check the connect count repeatedly. test-patch.sh passed locally as did mvn test -Dtest=TestShuffleHandler. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
