[Preliminary patch. This add a ugi to JobClient and uses the already existing ugi in JobContextImpl to make sure all the calls to clientprotocol api's are wrapped around doAs with the ugi of the user when the jobcleint/Job was created. Still testing on a secure cluster., Updated patch with some bug fixes., This still needs some testing with Oozie. [~johnvijoe] has graciously volunteered to help with the testing., Updated patch merged with the latest codebase in trunk and 0.23., Tested the patch with oozie on a cluster. The patch seemed to work as long as in JobClient.submitJob(), when we do a Job.getInstance(), we do it with the conf passed in by the user - Job.getInstance(conf). After that the oozie web UI displayed 'success' and the job passed. 

Good job Mahadev., Fixed the bug that John pointed out. Thanks a lot John, you've been great help in testing and debugging this.

This message is automatically generated., I cant really think of unit testing this, since this is security related., Spent some time understanding what the issue was. The patch in it's current state looks good mostly. Couple of possible changes
- job = clientUgi.doAs() is repeated all over JobClient. That could move into a separate function.
- JobClient.jobsToComplete / getAllJobs - needs to be wrapped in a ugi.doAs

In 0.20, things were a little simpler - since the connection to the JobTracker was being established by the JobClient itself - using the ugi at JobClient creation time.
That may be an alternate for Yarn as well - YARNRunner, ClientServiceDelegate and ResourceManagerDelegate would need to keep an instance of the ugi they are created with - and use this for each RPC proxy creation., Addressed Sid's comments., -1 overall.
