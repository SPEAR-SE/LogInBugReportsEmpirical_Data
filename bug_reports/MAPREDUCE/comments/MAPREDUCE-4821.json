[branch1 patch, TestJobTrackerRestart testcase is not included in trunk
, is there a JUnit 3 jar in your Ant classpath? There has to be a junit4 one else the test case won't compile -I suspect your ant installation has a junit jar that's being picked up first at test run time.

{{ant -diagnostics}} will show this. If it's there, delete it and see what happens when the original test is rerun., Hi Amir, Hadoop-1.1.1 release candidate was put to vote on Nov 20, and passed.  So this jira is too late to be fixed in 1.1.1.
Since it isn't committed to any branch yet, I'm clearing the "fixVersion" field, and setting the "TargetVersion" field to 1.2.0, which is the next version coming up.  When a patch is approved, please request it to be committed it to branch-1.  If you want it included in a 1.1.2, if and when such a patch release 1.1.2 ia made, then it can also be committed to branch-1.1.  Thanks., Hi Matt, is it too late to request the patch to be included in 1.1.2 release, thanks, Hi Amir, very sorry but the 1.1.2-rc5 build that passed the release vote, was built on January 31, and was in voting consideration when you posted this, so I didn't notice it.

Agree with 1.2.0 as target version.  Clearing fixVersion for now, as the patch is not yet committed.  Thanks., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2., branch-1 is now effectively EOL. Closing.]
