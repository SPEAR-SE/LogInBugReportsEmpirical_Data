[There is a race condition in the historyserver where two threads can be trying to scan the same user's done intermediate directory for two separate jobs.  One thread will win the race and update the user timestamp in {{HistoryFileManager.scanIntermediateDirectory}} *before* it has actually completed the scan.  The second thread will then see the timestamp has been updated, think there's no point in doing a scan, and return with no job found., This patch should fix the issue.  Recreating the problem is not that simple in the form of a unit tests, so I have not added any now ones in.  I am going to manually verify the issue, but I wanted to kick jenkins in parallel., Oops forgot to submit the patch :), {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
