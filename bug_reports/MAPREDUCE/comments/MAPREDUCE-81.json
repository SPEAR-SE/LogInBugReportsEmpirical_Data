[bq. wonder whether it has to do with the default value of 12 hours for mapred.userlog.retain.hours.
Yes, indeed it has. 
When a new task is started the task cleans the logs in the log directory if modifiedTime < now - mapred.userlog.retain.hours. 
We can fix this by first checking if the task owning that log file is still running, or we may just increase default value and mark this as wont fix, what do others think?
, This issue doesn't exist any more, because MAPREDUCE-927 solves this by modifying "mapred.userlog.retain.hours" to specify the time(in hours) for which the user-logs are to be retained after the job completion.]
