[Is this related to MAPREDUCE-5505 ?, Yes, it's related to MAPREDUCE-5505.

But, I checked the code in MRAppMaster#shutDownJob()
{code}
// job has finished
      // this is the only job, so shut down the Appmaster
      // note in a workflow scenario, this may lead to creation of a new
      // job (FIXME?)
      // Send job-end notification
      if (getConfig().get(MRJobConfig.MR_JOB_END_NOTIFICATION_URL) != null) {
        try {
          LOG.info("Job end notification started for jobID : "
              + job.getReport().getJobId());
          JobEndNotifier notifier = new JobEndNotifier();
          notifier.setConf(getConfig());
          notifier.notify(job.getReport());
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
          LOG.warn("Job end notification interrupted for jobID : "
              + job.getReport().getJobId(), ie);
        }
      }
{code}

Sending job end notification is called even before checking isLastRetry. Therefore, if the first attempt fails and the application has the second chance, the notification will still be sent, which is not expected., Will fix together in MAPREDUCE-5538.]
