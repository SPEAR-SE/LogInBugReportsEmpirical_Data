[This is seen particularly for those nodemanagers which had a few containers in execution., Hi Ramya,

    I have verified the same with and without containers running in NM. It works fine for me always. Please give me any specific scenario it happens or always. And also can you give the info in the NM logs after decommissioning(state of the NM and any exception occurred)., Hi Devaraj,
I am able to reproduce the issue consistently. I have 6 NMs and I decommission all of them while I have a few apps still running. Below are the last few lines of the NM logs which failed to shutdown completely:

, Ramya, could you reproduce the issue and grab the jstack output on one of the hung NMs?  I'm guessing one or more threads are not shutting down properly and preventing the process from exiting.  The jstack output could help verify this and show which subsystem owns the threads., If the jstack output shows DeletionService threads hanging around and {{yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec}} has been set to a relatively large value then this is a dup of MAPREDUCE-3862., I also cannot reproduce this - decommissioning normally and during app execution both shut down the NM cleanly for me.

Ramya please take a thread dump of the faulty NM when you run into this again. Thanks!

Moving this to 0.23.2., bq. Ramya, could you reproduce the issue and grab the jstack output on one of the hung NMs? 

Reproduced the issue. Attached the jstack of the NM which failed to shutdown, This does look just like the failure mode described in MAPREDUCE-3862.  Could you verify the value set in the configs for {{yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec}}?, Jason, the value for yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec is set to 36000, Then yes, this is most likely a duplicate.  I suspect if we were to wait 10 hours then the NMs would finally exit normally.

If you set that config value to zero then I'd expect this problem to disappear.  Could you confirm that's the case?, bq. If you set that config value to zero then I'd expect this problem to disappear. Could you confirm that's the case?
I set the config value to 0 and saw the problem disappear. The NMs are shutting down eventually after the config change., Marking this as a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-3862., *Really* marking it as a dup this time.]
