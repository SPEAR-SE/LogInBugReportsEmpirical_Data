[+1 this looks good to me. Have you run tests/test-patch?, bq. Have you run tests/test-patch?

It compiles and I was hoping Hudson would do the test/test-patch. OTOH, this class (in fact, all the classes in this package inside the mr project) is not referenced anywhere in the project (though probably still in someone's config files), so it should have no impact to the result of test/test-patch., Results of running test-patch are below.  This patch does not need new/modified tests.
