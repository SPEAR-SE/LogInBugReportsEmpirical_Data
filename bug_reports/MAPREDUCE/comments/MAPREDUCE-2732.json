[m2723_20110726.patch: fix the compilation problem., I'm not an M/R committer, but this patch looks good to me., Hi Aaron, thanks for the review.

I have checked it manually that it fixed the MapReduce compilation problem.

I have committed this., It looks like the check-in comment for this got the wrong JIRA They got posted to MAPREDUCE-2723 (One that I have assigned to me) not MAPREDUCE-2732.  I'm not sure if this is something that needs to be fixed for tracking purposes, or if this is enough of an FYI to point people to where the notes are. , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #759 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/759/])
    Fix a typo in CHANGE.txt: MAPREDUCE-2723 should be MAPREDUCE-2732.
