Summary
-------

RM web ui scheduler link doesn't show correct max value for queues because the maxCapacity definition is inconsistent and off by a factor of 100.


This addresses bug MAPREDUCE-3327.

 Can you include a small test case just to make sure all the properties are read properly in the leaf queues?, Done. Kindly review.

This message is automatically generated., Anupam,
 Can you please investigate the test case failures?, Anupam, I think you need to handle the case where maximumCapacity isn't initialized (ie is = to CapacitySchedulerConfiguration.UNDEFINED).  The line you added to divide maximumCapacity by 100 will cause issues if its UNDEFINED. , Thanks Tom and Mahadev. I have fixed the test failures, am re-submitting patch for review., +1 overall.
