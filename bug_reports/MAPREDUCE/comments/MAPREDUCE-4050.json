This message is automatically generated., Verified patch manually, it now displays *N/A* as the value of node link for unassigned task attempts rather than +null+, +1. Simple patch for the UI - doesn't require additional tests. Also verified the patch manually. , Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-0.23.
