[ Konstantin , do you still see this? I dont see this issue on trunc.
 , Yes I do on my linux machine. It is stable. I see the job is stuck doing something at 100% cpu, then reschedules tasks, and finally fails.
What could be the problem?, Attaching a complete log of the test run. It contains a thread dump taken in the middle of the wait., I donot see the issue on latest trunk. 
The issue could be because of issue HADOOP-1281. Can you try this on latest trunk and see whether the issue still exists?, Yes I tried, it's a different issue., Can this be closed?, The issue is not resolved. Do you have an explanation?, I could not reproduce the issue. 
I tried on latest trunk with the following command -
ant test -Dtestcase=TestMiniMRMapRedDebugScript -Dtest.output=yes

Tests run well. Attaching the log of test run, 
Konstantin, after running the test on your machine, I noticed FSEditLog.java:printStatistics is taking time.

The following logs show that  fs.FSNamesystem (FSEditLog.java:printStatistics(741)) is taking time, which is timing out the job also, thereby failing the test.

, This is interesting.
printStatistics() is called in 2 places FSEditLog.close() and FSEditLog.logSync().
Both methods wait() if FSEditLog is locked by another thread.
Is it possible that we have some kind of a deadlock there?, bq. Is it possible that we have some kind of a deadlock there?

I think there is no deadlock, because that eventually finished, except that it is taking time.

, This test fails again.  HADOOP-4410 was created.  Should we close this?, Please close this. We haven't seen timeouts with the testcase in a long time.., Yup. Definitely. Closing.]
