[The attached patch updates the test to remove "exec" and perform platform-specific escaping of environment variable references.  With YARN-233, the "exec" is now inserted on the container side, because this is an OS-specific command.  With this patch, the test passes on Mac and Windows., I am not sure I understand how this test works.

On Windows should we substitute %CD% for %PWD%?, It might help to view this test side-by-side with the code in {{MapReduceChildJVM#getVMCommand}}.  That method is responsible for creating the command to launch in the YARN container.  The method uses {{Environment.JAVA_HOME.$()}} and {{Environment.PWD.$()}}, which translate the environment variables to $JAVA_HOME and $PWD or %JAVA_HOME% and %PWD% depending on the platform.

Great catch on %CD% vs. %PWD%.  We missed that in YARN-233, and it's probably a problem.  I think jobs are still working right now, because it's used in java.io.tmpdir=%PWD%/tmp, and the %PWD% resolves to an empty string, so it just uses /tmp.  It works, but it isn't really correct.  Do you mind if I spin off a separate jira to address this?  I think the scope of that change is going to be much larger.
, Thanks for the explanation. That makes sense why it passes. It's fine to the %CD% change in a separate jira.

+1, I just committed this. Thanks Chris!]
