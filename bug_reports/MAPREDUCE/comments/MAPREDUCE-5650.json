This message is automatically generated., If I understand correctly, the issue is that the default (mapreduce.task.profile.params) params will be supplied even when more specific params are specified.  Was the behavior different in MR1?  Want to make sure this is not an incompatible change., [~sandyr] thanks for taking a look at the patch. Your understanding is correct. In MRv1 (branch-1),  there are no task-type-specific profile params. The change is compatible. If the task-type-oblivious mapreduce.task.profile.params is specified then this value is used in the absence of a more specific key. , In that case I agree with you that this is a bug.  MapReduce properties that have specific versions map/reduce versions (e.g mapreduce.map.java.opts) should ignore the generic version (e.g. mapred.child.java.opts) when the specific versions are specified.  I'd like to get some other opinions on whether this is compatible before committing it though., For reference, here is the JIRA where these options were added: MAPREDUCE-3426.  It seems unrelated to them., I can't see how mapreduce.task.profile.map/reduce.params could ever work since mapreduce.task.profile.params is always passed as a JVM parameter to the task JVM regardless of whether the more specific parameters are set. So I agree it's a bug, and the fix looks good.
, Actually, I noticed a problem with the patch - it doesn't do interpolation of the profile filename (i.e. {{%s}} is replaced by the actual filename). Interpolation should be carried out for all three properties.

Also, I noticed these properties are not in mapred-default.xml, so they should be added there., [~tomwhite], thanks for reviewing the patch. I added the profile.params properties to mapred-default, and fixed my traditional code style mistakes regarding whitespace on the second line.

If I understand your interpolation comment correctly, the previous v02 version of the patch is already taking care of it. The string relevant for the current task attempt is first stored into profileParams and then we call.
{code}
        vargs.add(String.format(profileParams,
            getTaskLogFile(TaskLog.LogName.PROFILE)));
{code}

It's covered by the unit test in the patch. Please elaborate in more detail if I am missing something., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
