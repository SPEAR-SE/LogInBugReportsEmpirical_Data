, Sorry to come in late. 

I'm confused - setJar is a standard user-api - this seems like a bug in Oozie if it can't deal with it?

In the worst case - we can fix MR1 to use setJar too, but this fix seems off?, Arun, MR1 is just fine. The problem was in the MiniMRClientClusterFactory.java (part of the adapter in YARN to mimic MR1 API) which was using the setJar() to set up minicluster classes in the classpath. Thus if the job running against the minicluster was trying to use setJar(), it would not work. With this fix avoid using setJar(), thus allowing testcases submitting jobs using setJar() to work as expected. Hope this clarifies.
