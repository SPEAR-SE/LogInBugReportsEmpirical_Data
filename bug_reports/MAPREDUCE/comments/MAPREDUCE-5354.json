[So some job submissions will go through and some will fail based on which ones end up using the read only disk. It would be better if jobtracker could detect this bad disk and ignore it for future use. Otherwise users will have remove this dir from the config and restart jobtracker and thus loose all the jobs in progress or if they have recovery enabled they will start from scratch.]
