This message was automatically generated., Only log message update is done in this patch , test case not required for the same, Thanks [~bibinchundatt] for the patch.

Can you also fix the same in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.FileInputFormat class as well?, [~devaraj.k] Thank you for checking .Will update and upload soon, [~devaraj.k] Have uploaded the patch based on your comment. Also {{import org.apache.hadoop.mapred.SplitLocationInfo}} unused import have removed as part of the same. , +1, looks good to me. , Thanks [~bibinchundatt].
