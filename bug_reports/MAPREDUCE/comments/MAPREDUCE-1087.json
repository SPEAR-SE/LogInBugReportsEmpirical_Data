[It would also be a good idea to time out a debug script after some specific interval. A script can go rouge and block the slot forever. Maybe something similar to what we do respect to tasks when they fail to report status after some period of time., We should also control the size of the debugout file. Possibly via MAPREDUCE-1100.]
