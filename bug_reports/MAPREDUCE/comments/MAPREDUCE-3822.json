[Found the issue. This looks like more of a FileSystem Statistics issue. Here is the scenario, when creating FileSystems like FilterFileSystem/RawLocalFileSystem, LocalFileSystem, they all use the same uri (file://). On a getAllStatistics() it will return all the stats for all 3 file systems but only one of them is the true filesystem whose stats are being updated. When we update our counters in Task.java (updateCounters), we just use the scheme and set the counter values. So there is a race condition on which order you get the FileSystem Stats in which might lead to a value of 0 for FS counters. We could fix this in Common or just do a hack on checking non zero counters which we consider as the right counters. Not sure. 

Given that this is only on localfilesystem, I think we can skip on this for 0.23.1., This patch should fix the issue. In this patch, I am just adding the stats across FileSystem.Statistics which have the same uri. So for all the stats that we get for the same URI we will be adding the stats across the stats and exposing it up., I ran TestJobCounters quite a few times and it worked., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., +1. Patch looks good. No additional unit tests, since the patches fixes existing ones.
Tried out the change locally with a couple of WordCount run - FS counter values are consistent with the patch. They were different in 3 separate runs without it. Will commit shortly., Committed to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Mahadev., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #504 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/504/])
