[Sid, is this a blocker?, Not a blocker. I believe the dist cache isn't supposed to handle directories (only files), in which case the fix would be different.
, Sid, is this a "won't fix"?, Even if the dist cache is not supposed to handle directories it is being used on directories in 1.0.  There were even some bug fixes that went in so that in 1.0 the size of the directories is handled correctly and counted against the dist cache.  It is somewhat rare for people to use it, but it does work and it is used.  I would consider it a regression, although a small one.]
