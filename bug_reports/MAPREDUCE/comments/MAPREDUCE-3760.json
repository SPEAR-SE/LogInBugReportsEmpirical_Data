[I didn't think that the RM supported blacklisting.  The MapReduce AM does I know, but I didn't think the RM ever got information about that from the AM.  Are you referring to decommissioned nodes?, bq. Are you referring to decommissioned nodes?
I am referring to blacklisted nodes - the nodes which have been blacklisted due to node health check scripts., I think "blacklisting" here means "unhealthy."  And it is true that unhealthy NMs are lumped together with healthy NMs in the Active Nodes count.  I believe part of the reasoning here is that Active means "actively heartbeating" which both healthy and unhealthy nodes do.  Probably more useful if we remove the unhealthy nodes from the Active count since you can already get to an unhealthy node list from the web UI via the unhealthy nodes count link., Yes, as others noted, we don't use the blacklisted nomenclature anymore.

It makes sense to remove those from the active nodes list., Attached patch should fix this.

Not the most beautiful of the patches - mainly because unHealthy nodes are a part of the active node list internally and need special handling.

Renamed a few methods in RMNodeImpl as their semantics have changed since I originally wrote them.

Modified test-case and verified by looking at the output generated., This conflicts with MAPREDUCE-3754 a little., It does conflict with it a bit.  Also the Web Service API may also need to be updated so that it outputs data in the same way., bq. Also the Web Service API may also need to be updated so that it outputs data in the same way
Updated web-services also. Added a test too. Didn't know that web-services had such beautiful tests ;)

This message is automatically generated., Javadoc warning was because of HADOOP-8018. I am pushing this in., Making it major because the metrics also are wrong because of the same issue., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.
