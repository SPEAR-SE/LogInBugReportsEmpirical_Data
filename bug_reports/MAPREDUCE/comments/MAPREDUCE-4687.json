[I thought we were going to delete the MRv1 code and tests MAPREDUCE-4266.  I thought all that was left there was to change the patch to be a script so that it happens properly.  I would much rather just run an rm -rf then try and maintain a bunch of dead code. , Hadoop1 (MRv1) is no longer maintained. Closing.]
