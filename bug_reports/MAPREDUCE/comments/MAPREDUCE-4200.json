[did you looked at builds.apache.org if your error is Mac OS specific?, @Radim

Thanks for your comment.

Results of the last five builds are all failed.
https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/
So this issue is not Mac OS specific., From output messages, this ant target executed and failed.

https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/235bcba59b02f8a3234d042010cf74f8dcf4a2fa/hadoop-mapreduce-project/pom.xml#L178, This is not a bug.
When creating a tar ball, -Pdist option is needed.

After I ran the command "mvn clean package -DskipTests -Dtar -Pdist", it succeeded.
I close this issue.

Thanks., Not a problem.
Just forgot append "-Pdist" option.]
