This message is automatically generated., Minor nit. Comment about mock object return null in new test should be updated. Also, if you can provide a 23 patch, I can check it in there also., John, I have uploaded a new patch for trunk and branch-0.23.  The unit test for branch 0.23 was not possible due to the private and static functions that could not be mocked., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

, [~jeagles] , Is the fix version correct ? - did this go into 2.0.4-alpha, or to branch-2 (2.0.5-beta), I do not think this made it into 2.0.4 or 2.0.5. I believe the proper fixed version is 2.1.0 for hadoop 2.]
