This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good for the most part, but I would like to see the test also cover badRequest(null), which is the case that is causing the error., Oh also because the message itself is null, there is no good way to debug the issue.  Could you look at where badRequest is called and see if we need to log the error before displaying the error page., Thanks a lot for the review.

The test was handling both the scenario's with null and without null message. Anyway I have made it separate cases now in the updated patch.
