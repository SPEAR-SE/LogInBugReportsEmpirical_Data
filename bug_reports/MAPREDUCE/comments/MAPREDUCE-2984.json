This message is automatically generated., It is straightforward scenario and doesn't need any tests. 

Verified it manually, after applying the patch it displays message "Unknown container. Container is either not yet running or has already completed or doesn't belong to this node at all." instead of causing it to NPE., The real cause is that the container has completed before we can display it's page?, bq. The real cause is that the container has completed before we can display it's page?

If so, can we just display a message such as: 'Unknown Container. Container might have completed, please go back to the previous page and retry.', Updated the message as per Arun suggestion., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
