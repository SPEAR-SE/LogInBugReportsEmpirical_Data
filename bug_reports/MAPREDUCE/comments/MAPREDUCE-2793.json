This message is automatically generated., Tried out the patch. Nice to finally have proper Ids in the UI.
Couple of changes though
- MRApps - JOB, TASK, ATTEMPT - not needed anymore.
- MRApps - JobId toJobID(String) - Instead of converting to mrv1 jobId and then to an mrv2 jobId - it'd be better to build the mrv2 id directly. ConverterUtils has such a method for ApplicationId. Similarly for taskID and taskAttemptID
- TaskID/TaskAttemptID.forName() - the exception string should not be defined up front - extra objects created for valid strings. That's only required in case of a malformed string., I did not use the helper methods in ConvertorUtils because the currently used one have better error messages and some tests are testing that proper errors are reported.
Rest fixed. The code in the forName functions are trying to use the same exception code and  use fall through from catch blocks to do that. I have made the minimal changes to make it work with the above code flow., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The reason these failed was I removed the default exception string (per the review comments). I forgot why I had put them there in the first place. The TaskId*.forName() code error path is not simple. It has errors through exceptions and the if-else statement checks. Earlier it would throw exceptions in multiple places with slightly different texts, as well as right in the end. I removed the exceptions thrown everywhere else and used the one in the end as the common one (to make the tests less flaky). Now this means, that the exception message string must be properly generated for all error paths. That would have been easy had it only been via exceptions. But there are if-else code paths that also produce errors.
End results is that I am going back to the default error strings. This might allocate an extra string but it would be a very short lived allocation (so its easy for the GS is my guess) and looking at the rest of the code makes me believe this extra allocation is not something to worry about., Uploading new patch per comments above. I have run all the failed tests locally and they pass., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., TaskID and JobID forName currently seem to generate a single exception string only - irrespective of the few if/else conditions. The patch is changing the exception message based on where the exception occurs.
Irrespective of what the other code is doing - creating this extra string each time forName is invoked can be avoided.
In fact any change to forName can be avoided if mrv2 JobId,TaskIds can be constructed from string directly. A separate implementation of forName for mrv2 types., This patch does not have extra strings., Thankyou. +1, subject to jenkins +1., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., This test intermittently passes and fails. This fails when 2 jobId objects that refer to the same job, produce different hashCode's ., bq. This fails when 2 jobId objects that refer to the same job, produce different hashCode's .
Is this happening after this patch or it was already there? If it is the later, can you please open a separate ticket and reattach+rerun it through Jenkins hoping it passes the next time around., The hashCode difference was because the ApplicationId internal to JobId was different. The test creates 3 jobs with the same app id. However currently, having jobid == appid is baked into a lot of code including the one used to fix the inconsistency in names. The test would create a list of 3 jobs with id's 0,1,2 and app id =0. The it would fetch the all the jobs from the webserver, pick the first job and verify that it exists in its list. Hence when the new code in the webserver was used to generate the jobid from the jobid string, it returned a job id with app id equal to the job id. This job id would have a different app id than the one in the test list except for when the job id was 0. So when the first job in the list was job id 0 then the test would pass, and otherwise it would fail. The order in the list would change with each run because the list was a hash map., Changed the test to have jobid==appid. The AppContext methods that are supposed to return appId for the AppContext return null for this TestAppContext so that it crashes deterministically if it gets used in the  future., +1 overall.

Pushing this in. Meanwhile can you please open separate ticket for the TODO comments you left, regarding the correct error code?, Thanks! MAPREDUCE-3923, I just commented this to trunk, branch-0.23 and branch 0.23.2.

But Sid told me offline about a disabled test. Bikas, if that isn't intentional, can you provide a new patch enabling them back?, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1853 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1853/])

, Re-enabling those tests. Tests pass locally., okie, I just ran the test again, passing. I am pushing the fix in without passing through Jenkins all the way again as it is only reenabling tests and doesn't involve any other code change., I just committed the fix too.
