[MRApps already include files in distributed cache when adding them to classpath env of MRApps. However, "jar"s are excluded for some reason (seems not valid now). In this patch, we add it back., \\

This message was automatically generated., The test failure is because  YarnConfiguration.YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH is always empty string without any settings. In this case, we should use YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH as default value. Fix this in v2 patch., Fix some whitespace issue in v2.1 patch., \\

This message was automatically generated., Fix minor issues like: javadoc warnings, checkstyle, etc., I debugged this offline with [~djp].

Some offline notes
 - The original problem was tracked at MAPREDUCE-5490 for Hadoop 1, which didn't go in. Essentially, things like hive running as part of Oozie actions do not get the distributed-cache files in their classpath.
 - In Hadoop 1, the MapReduce child wouldn't set CLASSPATH and HADOOP_CLASSPATH to distributed-cache files.
 - In Hadoop 2, the situation got better, CLASSPATH is set correctly to have distributed-cache files. But HADOOP_CLASSPATH doesn't. Unfortunately, hadoop scripts don't respect CLASSPATH that is set, so we have to explicitly set HADOOP_CLASSPATH to also point to distributed cache files.

The solution for this is to have MapReduce set distributed-cache files in HADOOP_CLASSPATH in addition to setting in CLASSPATH.

Junping Du, the patch looks good.
 - We are not setting this for the AM, but that sounds okay.
 - We are making sure that any HADOOP_CLASSPATH already set is inherited instead of replaced - good!
 - We are only put the distributed-cache entries, and skipping MR framework etc - good again!

The patch looks good to me. Been reviewing this offline. Will check this in if Jenkins says okay., What happens if the user has HADOOP_CLASSPATH set in hadoop-env.sh?, bq. What happens if the user has HADOOP_CLASSPATH set in hadoop-env.sh?
 - If the user has this on the submission node, that is not getting inherited - this is similar to what we do fro CLASSPATH.
 - If the admin sets it in the daemons, and also configures yarn to white-list those envs, we are inheriting them into the task. Again similar to CLASSPATH., bq. If the admin sets it in the daemons, and also configures yarn to white-list those envs, we are inheriting them into the task. Again similar to CLASSPATH.

If the original problem is that the bin commands don't pick up this up, this fix makes the assumption that HADOOP_CLASSPATH allows inheritance from the parent shell. The default examples in trunk specifically don't do this to prevent the double settings problem that plagues prior releases.

In fact, since HADOOP_CLASSPATH is really intended for users to use, why are we overloading it?  For trunk at least, it would probably be better to have a different var that is handled via mapreduce's shellprofile.d bit.  , \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. If the original problem is that the bin commands don't pick up this up, this fix makes the assumption that HADOOP_CLASSPATH allows inheritance from the parent shell. The default examples in trunk specifically don't do this to prevent the double settings problem that plagues prior releases.
The original problem is that the commands don't pick up CLASSPATH set by users on the shell - Owen tells me offline that this went long back.

bq. In fact, since HADOOP_CLASSPATH is really intended for users to use, why are we overloading it? For trunk at least, it would probably be better to have a different var that is handled via mapreduce's shellprofile.d bit. 
The specific scenario here user is spawning bin/hadoop commands within his/her tasks - so this blurs the lines between interactive vs non-interactive usecases - and the user is expecting distributed-cache to be accessed in the spawned shells.

I am going to get this in only into branch-2 and branch-2.7/2.6. We will have to think more about the right-approach for trunk. Will open a separate ticket for this.

bq. -1 	whitespace 	0m 1s 	The patch has 1 line(s) that end in whitespace. Use git apply --whitespace=fix.

, Committed this to trunk, branch-2, 2.7 and 2.6. Thanks Junping.

[~djp], can we please followup on the trunk changes? Thanks.., Thanks [~vinodkv] for review/commit and [~aw] for comments.

This also sounds like a good way. Agree that we can discuss more later (on another JIRA) for trunk.

+1. Just filed MAPREDUCE-6458 to address this., Just so it's on record so when someone hits this problem:  this is fragile and subject to breakage, regardless of the version of hadoop in play.  It all depends upon how users have HADOOP_CLASSPATH configured in hadoop-env.sh and yarn-env.sh.  , bq. Just so it's on record so when someone hits this problem: this is fragile and subject to breakage, regardless of the version of hadoop in play. It all depends upon how users have HADOOP_CLASSPATH configured in hadoop-env.sh and yarn-env.sh.
It is a bit fragile, for sure, but it doesn't by default depend on what is configured in *-env.sh like you said. This is because HADOOP_CLASSPATH is not part of the default white-listed environment that goes from YARN to the apps., bq. This is because HADOOP_CLASSPATH is not part of the default white-listed environment that goes from YARN to the apps.

If I have HADOOP_CLASSPATH="foo" in hadoop-env.sh, when I run a shell command (say "hadoop version") as part of my app, that's going to overwrite whatever Hadoop tries to set it to.  The whitelist is completely irrelevant., Here's a test you can do to prove my point.

$ echo "HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/tmp" >> $HADOOP_CONF_DIR/hadoop-env.sh
$ hadoop classpath

You should see /tmp

$ HADOOP_CLASSPATH=/etc hadoop classpath

You'll still see /tmp.  You won't see /etc.  (Well, unless your classpath is really weird already.)
, The patch in this JIRA caused regression. Previously the MR container inherit HADOOP_CLASSPATH from system environment, now it completely replaced it. I think we need to add this line to the end of setClasspath() in MRApps.java:
{code}
    MRApps.addToEnvironment(
        environment,
        hadoopClasspathEnvVar,
        System.getenv(hadoopClasspathEnvVar),
        conf);
{code}, MAPREDUCE-6619 is filed to track/fix this issue. Thanks [~shanyu] for reporting this issue., Hi folks, I noticed this JIRA is not present in trunk, though Vinod's comment says:

{quote}
Committed this to trunk, branch-2, 2.7 and 2.6. Thanks Junping.
{quote}

Based on the above discussion, I think this was only intended for branch-2 and thus git is correct, but I would appreciate clarification., [~andrew.wang], Yes. this and MAPREDUCE-6619 only for branch-2 now. For trunk, Allen want to do something different but I am not sure the progress there. May be we should consider to port this and MAPREDUCE-6619 to trunk as well?, This patch makes a huge assumption about the shell scripts that is no longer true in trunk (and my attempts to teach bash in this jira failed). In the end, users who use hadoop, hdfs, yarn, and mapred commands in their code will discover they don't have distributed cache jars in their classpath.  ]
