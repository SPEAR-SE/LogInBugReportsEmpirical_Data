[This patch fixes the issue. Unfortunately I haven't had time to add a unit test, since this area of code isn't unit-tested. But I verified on a cluster that my log levels now respect the configured log levels, where they used to be at DEBUG level., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I think the Javadoc issues are bogus, given I didn't touch javadoc, Todd, the patch looks good.

Can I, please, ask you to add the same feature for the MR AM itself? We can add a config key and change YARNRunner.createApplicationSubmissionContext to call the same api to set the logging options? Thanks!, It seems like I'd have to move the utility code over into hadoop-mapreduce-client-common, right? Since MapReduceChildJVM is in client-app, and YARNRunner is in client-jobclient, and those don't have dependencies on each other?, (and if you agree, can you give me an idea on where in -common it should go? Still learning my way around the code layout), Agreed.

I'd suggest MRApps.java - it has similar utils for setting env etc. Thoughts?, Cancelling patch since Todd is improving it a tad., here's an updated patch. Haven't had a chance to try on a cluster., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
