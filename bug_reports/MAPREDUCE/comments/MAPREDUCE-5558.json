[Verified the attached patch through TestExportSnapshot from HBase., To give some idea.. the situation is like this
* JobConf-> "fs.defaultFS" points to hdfs.
* The files added are from different location. Few are from "file://" where as few are from "hdfs://".
Therefore in path parsing anywhere if we loose scheme/authority then we take the one from conf. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Turns out that LocalJobRunner always uses LocalFileSystem.

Starting MiniMapReduceCluster in HBase test solves the problem., Hive meet the similar problem when enable local mode and defaultFS is hdfs. The simple fix now has problem with adding schema of "hdfs://" to classpath which block most of mainstream cases for DistributedCache.
