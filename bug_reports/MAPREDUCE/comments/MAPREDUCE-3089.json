[We need to add a test for MAPREDUCE-3089 once this test is enabled., I am reenabling the test as part of MAPREDUCE-3078. Will use this for the pending test., 
Is this jira done?, bq. We need to add a test for MAPREDUCE-3089 once this test is enabled.
I intended to say "for MAPREDUCE-2646"

Editing the title., Not a blocker., Hi [~acmurthy]
Since both MAPREDUCE-3078 and MAPREDUCE-2646 are all resolved. Is this JIRA still an issue in 2.x? If so, could you retarget it to 2.x?]
