[sorry, Jira ate the python whitespace formatting and under-under strings, it is hopefully clear enough.  Failure example emitted output before "for line in sys.stdin" loop, suceeeding example emitted output within the loop (but before printing output). , This bug still seems to exist in 0.20.1, The patch from HADOOP-5623 actually solves this issue as well, though it wasn't mentioned in that JIRA. Will reopen that and ask to be committed for 0.20.2]
