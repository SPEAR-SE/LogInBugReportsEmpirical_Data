Patch looks good to me except these minor comments.

1. There are some trailing whitespace in the newly added code. Can you try to avoid these whitespaces?
{code:xml}
<stdin>:9: trailing whitespace.
....
warning: squelched 9 whitespace errors
warning: 14 lines add whitespace error
{code}

2. In testTaskProgress(), can you avoid interrupting the thread which throws InterruptedException and use the reporter.resetDoneFlag() for notifying the thread.

{code:xml}
t.interrupt();
{code}

3. And also can you change the access specifier for these inner classes DummyTask, FakeUmbilical and DummyTaskReporter as private?

, Was just made aware of this, by way of MAPREDUCE-6740. Thanks for adding this config. 

Thinking more about it, I wonder if the default should be a fraction of the task.timeout, say a tenth. By default, all longer tasks would then report progress every minute. Users could just change one config without thinking about the other. What do others think? ]
