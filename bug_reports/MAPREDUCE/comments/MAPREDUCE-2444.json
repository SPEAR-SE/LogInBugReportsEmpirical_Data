[I think this is "by design"..., we have error when build cluster with mixed distr (debian, centos).
source build by different users in result cluster not started

may be more correctly compare (version && revision && srcChecksum), not a build version string?, This was essentially resolved with the move to Protobuf for the RPC layer.]
