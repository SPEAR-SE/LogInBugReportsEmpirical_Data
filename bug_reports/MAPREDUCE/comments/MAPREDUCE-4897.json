[A simple workaround until this is resolved may be to add a job.setMapper(â€¦) call at the end of job configuration, after MI but before submit, causing it to override MI's changes and making things work again., I just provided the identity mapper for the provided inputs, so the DelegatingInputFormat doesn't need to fall back to anything.]
