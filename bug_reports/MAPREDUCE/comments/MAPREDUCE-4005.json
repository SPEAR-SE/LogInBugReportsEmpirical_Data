This message is automatically generated., Test failure appears to be unrelated.  I am unable to reproduce the test failure even after merging up to latest on trunk., Turns out this is failing on trunk without these changes, and I didn't see it because git was lagging behind the svn repository.  Filed MAPREDUCE-4010., +1. Looks good., Committed to trunk, branch-0.23 and branch-0.23.2. Thanks Jason., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit #696 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit/696/])
