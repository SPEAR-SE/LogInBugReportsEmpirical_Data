[I propose creating a task-log4j.properties without the SecurityAuth logger, and passing that instead of the default to the task.  This is what MR2 does, with container-log4j.properties., +1 on the approach., This is difficult to write a test for, but I verified it on a pseudo-distributed cluster., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., +1, Thanks Sandy. Committed to branch-1., This patch is not compatible with older version. The main impact of this change is syslogs are missing on clusters which are configured with just log4j.properties. Also, stderr has the following WARN message:
log4j:WARN No appenders could be found for logger (org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child).
log4j:WARN Please initialize the log4j system properly.
