[I tried quoting the expression at line#84 and it worked.
That is 
{noformat}
elif [[ "$PREFIX_DIRS_AND_FILES" =~ ^(hadoop-common-project|hadoop-hdfs-project|hadoop-mapreduce-project)$ ]]; then
{noformat}
changed to 
{noformat}
elif [[ "$PREFIX_DIRS_AND_FILES" =~ "^(hadoop-common-project|hadoop-hdfs-project|hadoop-mapreduce-project)$" ]]; then
{noformat}, The change looks good to me.  I am not really sure why one version of bash seems to like it without quotes and another needs the quotes.  Could you turn it in to a patch?, stale]
