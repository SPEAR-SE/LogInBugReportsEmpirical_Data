[[~Karams] also reported the same.

I cornered it down to MAPREDUCE-2649. Before that patch, the submit call and the corresponding extraction of the callerUGI happen in the RPC itself, so the application's user was set correctly. Post that patch, all of that happens asynchronously under the system user UGI, so the user is set wrongly.

MAPREDUCE-2953 touches related parts of the code, will see what I can do there., Fixed via MAPREDUCE-2953., Reopening to set the correct resolution status: Duplicate.]
