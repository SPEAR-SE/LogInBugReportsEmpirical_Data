[[~cindyli_2012], can you share the environment when you ran the test case. I was unable to reproduce the test failure.

Read the log you've attached. It seems that the host name is not found. However, on my local machine, RMProxy always sees the IP address instead of the hostname., It passes now on trunk for me too. Closing this as invalid. Please reopen if that isn't the case.]
