This message is automatically generated., I like the patch, I have not tested it yet, so I cannot really comment on how the layout looks.  The only real issue I have is with the tests.  Mock ASM is using Random for start time, finish time, and states.  I know that this is very minor, but I have been bit too many times with having tests fail intermittently because of Random.  Random is great for stress testing, but it is a real pain to debug if you cannot replay the tests exactly.  Could you please either remove the use of Random all together, or just create one single instance of Random, and seed it with a known seed to begin with., The patch has issues when the number of jobs becomes more than 100. Going to update the patch.

Robert, sure I will fix to avoid using random., Updated patch which fixed the issue when #apps > 20 (not 100 like I mentioned before)., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Setting appropriate titles for the filtered pages.

Tested on single node., I finally got around to running this and taking a look at the actually web UI.  I think the change as it is now, is fine +1.

For consistency I would prefer to see something more like the history server, where we allow for column by column filtering in the javascript.  If you would rather leave the patch as is that is fine and I am happy to commit it for you., bq. For consistency I would prefer to see something more like the history server
The problem with doing that at the top level list is that once the page refreshes, the searched list (search on state) is gone. We can fix it by sending the search to the server, but don't think that's what we started with given we wanted all search on the client side.

Though I agree that it is still useful for the individual pages after filtering out based on state. Let's open a separate JIRA.

I am pushing this in., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23., bq. Though I agree that it is still useful for the individual pages after filtering out based on state. Let's open a separate JIRA.
