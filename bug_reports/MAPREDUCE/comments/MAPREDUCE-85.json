[In one case, TT the localization took a long time because of DistributedCache localizing files from DFS, and just before task timeout interval elapsed, the task was put to running state. TT in its offerService loop detected this task as running, compared the TIP's lastProgressReport to now and killed it as unresponsive. The TIP's lastProgressReport was set way back when the TIP itself got created in the TIP'sconstructor and the task didn't get to report it's progress yet., This seems to have gone stale. I've not seen tasks on branch-1 code behave in such a way even with very large dist-cache. So the locking has probably been improved and this is a non-issue now. Resolving.]
