[Do you have combiner configured? How many reduces?

The reason I'm asking is that the if you don't have combiner set, the progress is reported at least once per partition and  per 10000 (mapred.merge.recordsBeforeProgress) records., No combiner and 200 reducers when I tried.
Raising the number of mappers and reducers makes the issue disappear.
But it is not a solution, I think.

I can give more details on the job if needed (number of records, size of the output, etc...), Interesting, number of records, size of the output would be helpful. If the record size is large enough, the default 10000 records report interval could be too large., I forgot I actually do have a combiner.
In the combiner, I call reporter.progress() every 1000 values.

The numbers are a bit high for the number of mappers/reducers I am using, but it was an exploratory job.

Map input records 	454,219
Map output records 	29,528,547,433
Map output bytes 	        503,179,031,513
Combine output records 	map=56,287,259,615 	red=13,553,888,779
Reduce input records 	 	15,567,573,707
Reduce output records 	2,509,983
Reduce  shuffle bytes 	 	337,876,374,027

The first time I tried with 400 mappers and 100 reducers, and I had the timeouts.
The job manages to end with 2000 mappers and 200 reducers.
I tried with a larger input and I had the same timeouts.

The size of the record shouldn't be that large.
The key is always an int pair.
The value is either an int-float pair (most of them, 29,528,011,793) or an array of long-double pairs (535,640 records, for a total size of 649,693,592 bytes). I am using MultipleInputs and GenericWritable to shuffle them together, can this be the culprit?, I forgot to mention. I am using Hadoop 0.20.201 from Yahoo's distribution.
I don't know whether there are differences related to this behavior., i think that may be tt donot report anything to JT in the merge sort phase.SO JT think the tt failed and then kill the task.
maybe you can increase tasktrackerExpiryInterval in the JobTracker class., Well, I worked around the issue by setting mapred.task.timeout

In any case I think it is an issue, as my tasks finish within the original timeout, so I should not be forced to modify it.
What times out is the sort/shuffle phase. So some internal class is the culprit., As commented by Luke in MAPREDUCE-2177, the combiner code path doesn't report progress at some configured interval, so it can timeout when map output is large. A proposed fix is in CombineOutputCollector#collect to report progress a la Merger#writeFile.

The findbugs warning existed in trunk before my changes as well as evident in Jenkins (https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/703/artifact/trunk/findbugs/hadoop-findbugs-report.html).

An identical patch also applies to branch-0.22, however, pre-existing compilation failures on it prevent me from validating it. Uploading it nevertheless for completeness.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/465//console

This message is automatically generated., +1 on all of the patches.  The changes look good to me.  I am not wild about the name progressBar for how often to make progress, but it is not something to keep the patch out., The patch looks straight-forward.

{code}
+      progressBar = conf.getLong("mapred.combine.recordsBeforeProgress", 10000);
{code}

I'd declare both the key and value as appropriate constants.

Also, why did you pick 10000 as the default?, Thanks Arun, I am uploading the patches with constants replacing the direct values. I chose 10000 because it is the default value for mapreduce.task.merge.progress.records in Merger#writeFile which has similar logic. Please let me know if there is a better default value I should be using., Anupam - please define the config key in MRJobConfig for trunk.

I've committed the patch to 0.20.205. Thanks., Thanks a lot Arun!
