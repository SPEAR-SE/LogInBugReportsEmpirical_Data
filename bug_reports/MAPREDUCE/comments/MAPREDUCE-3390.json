[Attaching a patch to see if there is anything else that needs to be done. Will attach a patch with unit test later., Oozie is blocked on this for 0.23 integration and hence marking this as a blocker., I am fine with the patch as is. But I am skeptical that it will fix any issue. The generated-classpath file should always be there in the jars and you shouldn't be hitting this at all. Unless you are running into random jar related issues like staleness. Can you please confirm?, There is something wrong in how things works here, the generated-classpath is useless as its obtained from the build environment where Hadoop was built, see MAPREDUCE-3389. Thus makes it unusable by downstream projects., @Vinod: This was the case of a stale jar or something like that., Not adding any tests to the patch since its not a real failure and is not reproducible. , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Stale jars is an environmental issue which you should fix. But the patch is pretty innocuous, I am fine with it as the underlying generated-classpath stuff needs a major fixing anyways.

Let me just update this patch to be applicable on latest trunk and commit it., Same patch as John's, updated to trunk., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
