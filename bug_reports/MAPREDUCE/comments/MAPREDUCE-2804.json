[This came as part of the changes in 204.  I can't find the same message in 203., MAPREDUCE-2415 distributed the userlogs on to multiple disks. Its implementation relies on this symlink creation from attempt-directory of (older) userlogs directory to attempt-directory on one of the multiple disks.
The design doc attached to MAPREDUCE-2415 can give more details., Thanks.  Now we know the source of the patch that introduced this message., I'm seeing this one too. Interestingly, it seems to be reported for a task that finishes without problem. But another task that is starting at the same time fails with no logs and no explanation., I found it and will generate a patch this afternoon., Fundamentally, there were two problems:

1. The logging message was less than useful.
2. There is a race condition when java's primitives are used to change permissions on a file.

This patch fixes the log messages to be much clearer about what is going wrong and removes the extra chmod of the job directory. It was that chmod that was causing the creation of the symlinks of a different task to fail when they were launching at the same time., +1, +1, The patch conflicted with HADOOP-7100, so here is the proposed updated patch., Oops, that should be HADOOP-7110., +1 for the branch-0.20-security patch., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was just released.]
