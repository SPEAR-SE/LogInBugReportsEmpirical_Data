[[~jarusn], is this still an issue? Would you have time to look at this and provide a patch?
, Re-posting to all users

I am a newbie and this is my first post here. I looked at the issue and code and I want to propose another solution.
We could accumulate the keys in DBRecordWriter#write() into a collection and in DBRecordWriter#close() we could do a batch insert of 500 or 1000 keys in single batch. This is not ideal, but might help with large inserts and update the progress.
I would like to provide a patch if this solution is acceptable., on my local , I made the change and tested org.apache.hadoop.examples.DBCountPageView.java . The example ran fine and I didn't see the exception in verify() method. , [~shyam_gav] sounds reasonable. I'm thinking to make the batch size configurable. Could you tackle this issue?, Yes, I can make the batch size configurable. I will work on it. , [~ozawa] I made the configuration change. Added a property  in mapred-default.xml 
<property>
  <name>mapreduce.output.dboutputformat.batch-size</name>
  <value>1000</value>
  <description>The batch size of SQL statements that will be executed before reporting progress. Default is 1000</description>
</property>

Added a constant in MRJobConfig.java - public static final String MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE="mapreduce.output.dboutputformat.batch-size";

Let me know if this good and I will create a patch. , I also tested it by running org.apache.hadoop.examples.DBCountPageView.java and I didn't see any exceptions and the test was successful. , [~shyam_gav] thank you for updating. MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE is DBInputFormat specific configuration. Please add  the configuraition to MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE instead of MRJobConfig. After addressing the comment, could you attach the patch to jira?, In addition to the above comment, MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE should be renamed as MR_DB_OUTPUT_FORMAT_BATCH_SIZE., [~ozawa] can you please clarify " Please add the configuraition to MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE instead of MRJobConfig" . I will rename the MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE to MR_DB_OUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE, [~shyam_gav] Thank you for the question. That's my mistake: Correctly: "Please add the configuraition, MR_DBOUTPUTFORMAT_BATCH_SIZE, to DBOutputFormat  class instead of MRJobConfig". , I made the changes and applied the patch. Please review , Submitting for code review before submitting the patch, Hi [~shyam_gav], submitting a patch just triggers a pre-commit build with unit tests. You don't need a code review to click 'submit patch'.

I'll let a MapReduce/YARN dev take a look at the actual patch., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
