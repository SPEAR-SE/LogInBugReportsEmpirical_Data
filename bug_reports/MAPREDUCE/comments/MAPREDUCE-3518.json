 Do you think we can add a small test case with this? I think itll be easy to write one and we should probably add one testcase for this. What do you think?, Good suggestion. My initial patch was quite small. The most recent patch is more substantial, and should require a new test case., Cancelling to address comments, Added a unit test to ensure this doesn't happen again., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., @Jon,
 I am little worried about adding another public api to JobClient via CLI.java (setCluster/getCluster). I think making them protected should be fine right? I dont see any reason to make them public. Is there?, I appreciate your comment on public APIs. Something definitely needs to be addressed. The difficulty lies in that the testing class needs the ability to mock out the cluster (protected no good), but exists in a different package (package-private no good). I have tried to address all concerns with the latest patch. In this patch I merely add no public API or vars in CLI or JobClient. Instead, I have created a small derived class for testing that is able to set the protected cluster., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
