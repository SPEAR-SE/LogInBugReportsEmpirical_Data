[Some investigation based our logs:

TA_COMMIT_PENDING at COMMIT_PENDING happens because there're two TA_COMMIT_PENDING that have been sent to TaskAttemptListenerImpl. The first one causes the state transition from RUNNING to COMMIT_PENDING, and the second one causes the invalid transition.

Here's the code that notifies AM of committing the pending task.
{code}
// say the task tracker that task is commit pending
      while (true) {
        try {
          umbilical.commitPending(taskId, taskStatus);
          break;
        } catch (InterruptedException ie) {
          // ignore
        } catch (IOException ie) {
          LOG.warn("Failure sending commit pending: " + 
                    StringUtils.stringifyException(ie));
          if (--retries == 0) {
            System.exit(67);
          }
        }
      }
{code}

The loop has been iterated twice, because the following exception happens:

Throughout the log, I can see a lot of "IOException: An existing connection was forcibly closed by the remote host" (This issue seems to have been raised and solved in HADOOP-317, but it still occurs on Windows), and this particular exception instance results in re-sending committing message to AM.

In addition, it seem to have a logic problem about re-sending the committing message. Given the service side has done everything, but IOException happens on the response. The second should not to be sent by the client, or should be ignored by the service. This is something we need to fix at the MR side. There're two options to fix the invalid transition:

1. At the state machine, we ignore TA_COMMIT_PENDING when a task attempt is at COMMIT_PENDING. This is just a one-line fix.

2. We can add RetryCache for TaskAttemptListenerImpl, when commitPending is called, we check whether we have cache for a particular attempt Id. If we have, it means the transition has been executed before, and we can skip the transition.



, Create a patch with option (1) to fix the problem quickly. And we should file a follow up ticket to go through the \@AtMostOnce protocol APIs of MR, and make them use the retrycache. Once this is done, we can default this quick fix., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
