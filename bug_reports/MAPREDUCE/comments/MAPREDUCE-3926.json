[Mitesh,
I guess adding this to 0.20.205 might involve a lot of change. Also, the JT has no information about the running tasks i.e they could in fact be RUNNING, KILLED, FAILED, PENDING etc.

Note that this can happen for SUCCESSFUL jobs too. The job can still complete/finish while the speculative tasks are running. In such cases, there is no information about the speculative tasks logged in the job history.

This can surely be fixed in trunk., Hi Amar,

In Hadoop 0.23, in the Job History file, the task tracker information of unfinished map task is stored in TASK_STARTED and MAP_ATTEMPT_STARTED.
