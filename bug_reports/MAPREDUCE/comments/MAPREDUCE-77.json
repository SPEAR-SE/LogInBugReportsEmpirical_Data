[Is this required to be a blocker? I think it can wait till 0.21. What do you think?, None of the constructors for mapreduce.Job take JobConf. I don't see a problem., Pig has 100+ warning messages because of JobConf deprecations. Its very distracting to developers and extremely hard to monitor other warning and error messages. It cannot wait till 0.21. I hope it is be fixed at the earliest. I am lowering the priority to critical.,  $ find . -type f -name "Job.java"
./src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/jobcontrol/Job.java
./src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/Job.java

I am referring to jobcontrol/Job.java. If its deprecated then its not marked as such., Re-opening issue., Now that JobControl is modified to use new api, you can use new Constructors ]
