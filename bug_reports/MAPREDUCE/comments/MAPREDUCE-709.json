[Attaching patch fixing this issue:

* Setting proper exit status, previous we were not using TIMEOUT enum.
* Changed test case to check for proper timeout message., | Also the "mapred.healthChecker.script.timeout" is not being reflected in the job.xml. It always picks up the default value. It is just an UI issue.
The issue was due to wrong conf dir. No longer observed., Changes look good to me. +1. Please upload results of test-patch and relevant tests., output from ant test-patch
