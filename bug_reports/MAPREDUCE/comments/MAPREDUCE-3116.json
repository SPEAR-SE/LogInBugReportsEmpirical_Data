[Hmm.. older "working" jars that I have look the same. Wondering if something changed in the code., This change comes from MAPREDUCE-3021. Everything should be there as of rev http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1176709.  

What method of distribution are you using?   I tested using the tarballs.

In svn you will see:
./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/test/.keep
./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/cluster/.keep

, Interesting, so I was copying the jars from my target directory directly into my yarn_conf home. When I untgz's the tgz package, THAT hadoop-yarn-common jar has:

     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/test/.keep
     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/mapreduce/.keep
     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/cluster/.keep
     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/node/.keep
     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/yarn/.keep
     0 Wed Sep 28 10:01:32 PDT 2011 webapps/jobhistory/.keep

Strange.

Below are the logs:
2015-03-17 03:46:10,045 FATAL resourcemanager.ResourceManager (ResourceManager.java:main(874)) - Error starting ResourceManager
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.webapp.WebAppException: Error starting http server

        at org.mortbay.resource.JarResource.extract(JarResource.java:215)

From my analysis I have found that when I use root user for staring resourcemanager this error doesn't appear.
Only when I login into yarn user this error comes. Is t because of some permission issues ?
