This message is automatically generated., Patch change looks good, but we really should have a test for this.  It turns out there is an existing test that should have caught this problem, {{TestAMWebApp#testTaskView}}, but it has a bug and doesn't really test anything.  It sets up an {{AppContext}} to inject for the test, but {{TaskPage#render}} ditches early because {{isValidRequest}} returns false since {{app.getTask()}} returns null.  We should fix the test to setup an {{App}} object that contains the appropriate {{AppContext}} and inject that instead.  That will provide the proper {{AppContext}} and also have the appropriate task setup for the test to run properly.

It looks like there are a lot of other tests in TestAMWebApp that are broken this way.  We can fix those under another JIRA., I took a closer look at the other tests in TestAMWebApp.  They all look like they're getting mocked data except for testConfView which cuts out early because it doesn't have a job ID.  I'll file a JIRA to track improving that test., Thanks Jason. Here is an updated patch with the test fixed., Filed MAPREDUCE-5144 to track TestAMWebApp.testConfView's poor coverage., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
