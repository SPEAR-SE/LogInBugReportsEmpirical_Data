[Here's a fixed up test case:
- renamed "wc" and "pi" users to "alice" and "bob", since in fact both are running wordcount
- set up a proper staging directory with sticky bit, etc, so job can be successfully submitted
- sets up home directories for each user that are only writable by them (to make sure that the job is running as the right users)
- avoids using internal job submission APIs, so job actually submits
- checks return status of job to actually assert success
- shuts down services in correct order, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
