[I had encountered this very same issue.

The task in the attached screenshot had finished computing, and apparently had successfully sent data to the reducers (I checked some reducer logs). However, it lost the tracker before it notified the reducer about task completion. As a result, the job is stuck waiting for the replacement map tasks to finish, even though they are not needed.

(I cut out hostnames from the screenshots for privacy reasons), Is this related to MAPREDUCE-1060 ?, Yes, it is related., Fixed in Yarn(MAPREDUCE-279). Not getting fixed in 0.20.*/1.*.]
