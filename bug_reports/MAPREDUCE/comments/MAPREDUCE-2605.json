[Greg,

Per {{StreamJob#packageJobJar()}} in 0.22 and trunk, the file is created as a Java Temp File and is also asked to be deleted-on-exit (unless debug is turned on). Please reopen if you feel this does not work as intended.

Fix appears to be in 0.22 version, so marking that as the fix version. Unfortunately, revision history appears to end at some move performed long ago, so I can't find what exact JIRA was this fix related to.

Resolving as Not A Problem (anymore). But please re-open in case am wrong with something.]
