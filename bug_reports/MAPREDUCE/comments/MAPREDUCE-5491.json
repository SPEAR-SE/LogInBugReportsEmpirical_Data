This message is automatically generated., Even with this fix, it's very compressible data. Take a look at MAPREDUCE-5125 -- perhaps it's worth fixing both at once?, hmm, I did try move RandomTextWriter's logic here, it yeild to about 1:4 compression rate, did you think it is acceptable? I will see is there simpler random way to gain similar outputs., IMO we should move to a random array of bytes and ensure that the array is larger than typical compression windows -- eg allocate an 8MB buffer and do 8MB writes into the stream. We shouldn't have output that's in any way compressible for a test that's ostensibly about IO performance. (or, it should be an option), Patch updated, using pure random buffer with 1MB size by default. In this case, the data is almost uncompressible., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
