[The call appears to be fine while the failing job is up and running, but once it moves to the historyserver then it results in the NPE.  Apparently the historyserver is returning null for the task Counters when the task has failed, and the client isn't prepared to handle that., Patch to CompletedTask so it returns empty counters instead of null counters in the task report.

In addition to unit test, I also manually tested it with a fail job and verified that JobClient.getMapTaskReports did not throw an NPE when it redirected to the historyserver for the failed job., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks OK to me +1.  But this seems more like a band-aide than a full solution.  Shouldn't we be returning counters for the failed tasks too, just like the AM does?, Agreed, this is just to prevent the NPE but doesn't address the larger issue of the counter data being unavailable for failed tasks.  Filed MAPREDUCE-4693 to track that issue., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2849 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2849/])
