[bq. On a more general idea, I was wondering if the usage of the synchronized statement in the JT shouldn't be re-thought. Or maybe all this has already been addressed in YARN.
In YARN/MR2, a bunch of JT's functionality has been relegated to the MR-AM and JobHistoryServer. On top of that, the RM isn't as synchronized as the JT. 

That said, as long as it is not risky, we can see if we can have finer-grained locking for JT.getJobCounters.]
