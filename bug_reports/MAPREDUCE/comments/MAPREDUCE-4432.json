[Patch attached to update the warning message, Gabriel,

Thanks for filing this! I agree we should improve it. Your improvement is much nicer to read and understand as well :)

Given that GenericOptionsParser is a non-public API class, and Tool was the real to-be-used class for users, I think we should not suggest GOP at all and rather show the message just with Tool?, Good point about GOP -- I'll upload a new patch that only mentions Tool and ToolRunner., Updated patch that doesn't mention GenericOptionsParser, This looks good, thank you! +1 pending jenkins result., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Justification for the lack of new tests on this patch is that the patch is only changing the wording of a warning message, and therefore not a candidate for automated testing., I am +1 on this patch too.  Thanks Gabriel for helping to make Hadoop better. , Committed to branch-2 and trunk. Thanks for the contribution Gabriel, and thanks for the additional review too Robert!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2529 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2529/])
