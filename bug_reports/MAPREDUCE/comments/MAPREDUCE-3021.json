[note that MAPREDUCE-2999 is needed to make filtering work., Here is the proposal for the name change from host:port/yarn for everything to:

Resource Manager -> /rm
Node Manager -> /nm
Job history -> /history
Application Master -> /mr  (for map reduce)

I'm not super fond of the application master one. If people have other suggestions let me know., To clarify host:port/yarn gets replaced with host:port/rm, host:port/nm, etc.. 

Also note that a user can still just go to host:port which redirects you to proper host:port/<component> , unless that changes under MAPREDUCE-2999., +1 for different base-names in general. How about /cluster, /node, /jobhistory and /mapreduce respectively?, Note, during testing I also found an issue where in AM webui was presenting a link that had double slashes in it to get back to rm.  Jetty doesn't handle double slashes so I fixed it so the link doesn't have double slashes., Vinod, I'm fine with those names, just a bit more to type but clearer, anyone else? , patch using the names suggested by Vinod., minor test update., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The test failures are because the directories webapps/node are missing.  Note they are in the patch but I'm assuming it didn't get created properly here.  Whoever checks this in make sure the following directories and files are created.  The .keep are empty files to make it create the webapps directories in the build.  This is how it was done for the /yarn directory so did the same.

A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/cluster
A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/cluster/.keep
A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/node
A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/node/.keep

A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/jobhistory
A      hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-common/src/main/resources/webapps/jobhistory/.keep, Manual testing done since no unit test framework for the links.  

Tested all the yarn webapp: resource manager, node manager, job history, and app master ui.  For each verified that all the links in the tables and in the menus properly worked and went to the new uri which would be:

resource maanger: host:port/cluster
node manager: host:port/node
job history: host:port/jobhistory 
app master: host:port/mapreduce

Note that with MAPREDUCE-2999 host:port/ gets redirected now to host:port/<component>.  I tested with auth filtering on (hadoop.http.filter.initializers) with an auth filter that allowed you to bypass authentication on pages as configured.  Tested this with the new naming conventions and verified that the pages could be bypassed with the new names without collision between components.

resource manager has links:
  - nodes page has links to node manager. 
  - links to containers logs on node manager for the application
  - link to job history for finished apps
  - link to app master for running apps

app master page has menu in upper left corner back to the resource manager.
app master has link to container logs on node manager

Verify all the links within a component still work., I just committed this. Thanks Thomas!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1046 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1046/])
