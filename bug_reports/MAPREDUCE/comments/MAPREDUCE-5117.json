[I'm not sure it's related to MAPREDUCE-5088.  The error is occurring in this block of code:
{code}
    MRClientProtocol histProxy = instantiateHistoryProxy(conf,
        SecurityUtil.getTokenServiceAddr(token));
    try {
      RenewDelegationTokenRequest request = Records
          .newRecord(RenewDelegationTokenRequest.class);
      request.setDelegationToken(dToken);
      return histProxy.renewDelegationToken(request).getNextExpirationTime();
    } finally {
      stopHistoryProxy(histProxy);
    }
{code}

It's blowing up in the finally clause that histProxy is not a proxy.  The caught exception has been swallowed, but since histProxy isn't a proxy it's almost certainly failing on histProxy.renewDelegationToken.

So the question is how is histProxy not a proxy??, histProxy is actually a HSClientProtocolPBClientImpl - which contains the actual proxy. This, along with a couple other interfaces need to implement Closeable. Will submit a patch a little later., Changed MRClientProtocolPBClientImpl to implement Closeable. The alternate is to stop the history proxy using YarnRPC., +1 Looks ok to me., I assume this should go to trunk and branch-2 as well., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
