[In the HamletSpec.java, I see that elements including td, tfoot, li, th have @Element(endTag=false) annotation. Is this done purposefully?, See http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.6 and http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/struct/tables.html#h-11.2.5 - the end tag is optional for TR and TD. It seems like we chose to not add the end-tags.

Closing this ticket. Please reopen if you find a tag which is missing a required end-tag., bq. Is this done purposefully?

Yes :) Hamlet generates a subset of HTML 4.01 strict that is also a subset of HTML 5 working draft.

I'm aware of one validation error/warning: missing alt for img elements without alt set explicitly.

Please report any other spec/impl issues. Thanks.]
