This message was automatically generated., Thanks for the patch, Chang!

There's a mix of space and tabs in the patch, please only use spaces.

shutdownLogManager should not declare it throws Exception.  I don't see a reason it needs to throw at all.

Please add a comment to the body of MRApp shutdownTaskLog and shutdownLogManager explaining why it is not doing anything so when someone comes along later it's obvious why that was done., [~jlowe] thanks for review! I just updated my patch according to your suggestions., \\

This message was automatically generated., Nit: The comment wording could be improved quite a bit.  How about "Avoid closing the logging system during unit tests, otherwise subsequent MRApp instances in the same test will fail to log anything."?

Nit: Could you place the comments inside the function body?  Normally comments outside the function are for documenting why the interface exists, etc.  This is more of an implementation detail for this particular override., Thanks [~jlowe] for review and provide valuable suggestions! I just updated my patch to improve the comments and move comment inside the function body., .4 patch fixed some whitespace issues I just noticed, \\
