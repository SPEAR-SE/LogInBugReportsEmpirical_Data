[The way job details are recovered from the jobhistory filename is buggy. Every piece of code that tries to infer this information does  something like
{code}
1. split on '_'
2) username = split[5].
{code}
But the username can also have a '_' and this trick might no longer work. Same is true for jobname. , Attaching a patch the implements the basic idea. I have found out 2 places where the job-history filename was hacked 
1) jobhistory.jsp
2) HistoryViewer.java
Am I missing something?, A small bug fixed., Two things missing
1) The case where the _username_/_jobname_ contains a '_'.
2) Test case., MAPREDUCE-11 should fix this.]
