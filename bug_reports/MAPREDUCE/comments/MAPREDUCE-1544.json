This message is automatically generated., Nice work, Ben! Some comments:

in analysejobhistory.jsp:
-  need a space in between the word "Job" and the job ID in the title tag
{code}
+<b>Average time taken by map tasks:</b><%=StringUtils.formatTimeDiff(avg.getAvgMapTime(), 0) %><p/>
{code}
seems to be missing a space after the ':'

in machines.jsp:
- do we need <b> tags for the table headers there? I'd think we should make the <th> styling bold without needing <b>

in tasktracker.jsp, some malformed HTML:
{code}
<img src="/static/hadoop-logo.jpg"/ alt="Hadoop Logo"><br>
{code}



, Cool -- thanks for the feedback -- fixing it up -- question -- for reviewing
is the best thing after this to post a patch of the complete diff -- or just
diff since your comments?

Ben

This message is automatically generated., Sorry to come in late, the patch has gone stale. Can you please rebase? Thanks.

Given this is not an issue with MRv2 should we still commit this? I'm happy to, but not sure it's useful. Thanks., UIs have since been redone.  need a new jira if this is still an issue.]
