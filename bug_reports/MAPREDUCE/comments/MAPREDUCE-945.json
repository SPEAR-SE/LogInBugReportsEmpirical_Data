[ Test programs mentioned above are the programs/jobs which can be run using test jar. Following are a few valid test programs:
    DFSCIOTest
    DistributedFSCheck
    MRReliabilityTest
    TestDFSIO
     Filebench
    Loadgen
    Mapredtest
    Mrbench
    Nnbench

This issue pops-up while executing NNBench on multi-queue environment. Not able to run it on any of the queue viz. <abc>, <xyz> (any queue name except "default"). Every time error message is displayed "default queue doesn't exist" though examples programs (viz. sleep, sort etc.) are running fine on multi-queue envionnment. Queue name "default" seems to be hardcoded for these test programs., Same's the case with grep-sort part of the Grep example. And the common problem is that rest of the arguments are not parsed with a GenericOptionsParser and so explicit configuration properties set on the command line are not passed onto the job., After the project split the issue has to be split into two parts.

Created a new HDFS JIRA:  HDFS-587
, Iam fine with the patch except 1 small change,
dont think this was introduced in this patch.
variable "    Path intrimData = null; " is not used in method runJobInSequence in MRBench.java

This message is automatically generated., I ran the modified test case and verified it passed. Based on that, committed this to trunk. Thanks, Sreekanth !, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #24 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/24/])
    . Modifies MRBench and TestMapRed to use ToolRunner so that options such as queue name can be passed via command line. Contributed by Sreekanth Ramakrishnan.
