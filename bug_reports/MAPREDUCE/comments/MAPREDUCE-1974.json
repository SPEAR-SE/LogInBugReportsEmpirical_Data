[The patch looks good to me. Is there any way to test this? (Did you at least try to print the list before and see that a task is in there multiple times?), Hi Matei,
I see multiple same preemption in the log. I think I should add a test here to verify that.

Scott, Did you guys fix this one at Facebook? It would be nice to put it into trunk and 0.21.1 too., Hey Matei,

Sorry for not responding on this for a while.
We have put this in production for a long while and it fixes the problem.
I think it is OK to commit this., +1. this seems like a no-brainer!, {code}

{code}, I posted the result on the wrong patch. It should not have a +1 on test included.
Will run this again., test-patch result
