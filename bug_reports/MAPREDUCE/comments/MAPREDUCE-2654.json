[Missing events in the Job History Log.  
I compare the number of blocks on HDFS (replica 1) and the number of actual mappers (from JHL) and there is a mismatch. I checked in JHL, and there is no mention of some of the mappers that happened during the job. I can supply the logs if necessary.

, Hey Keren, it would probably be good to attach the logs to this JIRA. Are you capable of reliably reproducing this? If so, how?]
