[contrib/streaming/ivy.xml does not cover some of the dependencies, Adding a patch with additional dependancies for streaming.
Ran the tests and those passed, so this should do it, Please have a look at this., +1 the patch works., same problem in contrib/capacity-scheduler, This is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-1239., Just as a note, I've closed this issue instead of MAPREDUCE-1239 because MAPREDUCE-1239 already seems to have a patch that addresses problems with all the contrib projects., Sorry for the mistake. I should have found out MAPREDUCE-1239.
Thanks for closing it down.]
