[This is not a problem in usual scenarios when TaskTracker process space creates JobConf objects and automatically loads mapred-default.xml and mapred-site.xml in it's classpath via JobConf's static block. But this is still a problem when these files are not used and instead TT is setup via a passed JobConf object, for e.g. in a test environment., Likely stale.]
