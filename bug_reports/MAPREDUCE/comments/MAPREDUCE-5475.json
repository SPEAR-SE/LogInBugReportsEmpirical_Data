This message is automatically generated., I just committed this. Thanks [~jlowe]!, Good changes look good to me too. +1 after the fact.

We could do more with testing
 - Validate the specific message on AccessControlException
 - Negative tests for view-acl and 
 - Positive tests for modify-acl.

If you agree, I'll file a new ticket., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #309 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/309/])

, +1 for a followup JIRA for more rigorous testing.

Adding a patch for branch-0.23.  If you could give it a quick review, I'd be happy to commit.  Thanks!, Reopening, as this appears to be causing problems on a secure cluster.  Getting exceptions on the job submission client after the job starts running and it tries to connect to monitor the job:

13/08/22 18:51:59 ERROR security.UserGroupInformation:
PriviledgedActionException as:x@y (auth:KERBEROS)
cause:java.io.IOException: org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException:
User appattempt_1377189855273_0006_000001 cannot perform operation VIEW_JOB

Will revert the change for now until we better understand what's going on., The logged in user is AppAttemptId for client tokens, so for user based auth we need the appSubmitter in the token. Looks like we'll need YARN-707, working on it., Reverted.  [~vinodkv] indicated in an offline discussion that this is probably due to the lack of user info in the YARN client token, see YARN-707., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4310 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4310/])

, Verified that the original patch works on a secure cluster once YARN-707 was committed, so I committed this again to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.1-beta., Reverting this again... With YARN-707 users can see their own jobs again, but other users can still kill them because the token user is always the app submitter, and the AM sees all authenticated client connections coming from that user., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4320 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4320/])

, [~vinodkv], are you OK with this being committed now that YARN-707 has added the client name to the client-to-AM token?, +1 Would have been nice to avoid redundancy by having a method for the try/throw block on getting the user.  It's ok as-is though., Thanks for the review, Daryn.  I talked offline with [~vinodkv] and he was also OK with the patch going in after YARN-707.
