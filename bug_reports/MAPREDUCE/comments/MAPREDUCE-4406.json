This message is automatically generated., The first patch would reintroduce fixed ports in the minicluster, we don't want that for running testcases.

We could achieve this by having a new config property, ie 'hadoop.minicluster.fixed.ports' = FALSE (default).

If this property is FALSE, we use the current random port configuration.

If this property is TRUE, we use the fixed port behavior from configuration.

Then MAPREDUCE-987 would set this property to TRUE before starting the minicluster.

This wouldn't change the current random behavior which is desirable for dev/jenkins.

, Many thanks Tucu for the review! Yes, I have noticed now that all these addresses are in *-default.xml so will be picked by the minicluster and will be fixed. Here is a new patch adding the conf properties for using fixed ports. I'll be also updating MAPREDUCE-987 to set these ports., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
