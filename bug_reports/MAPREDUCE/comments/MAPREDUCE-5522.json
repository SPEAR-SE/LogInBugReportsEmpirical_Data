I'll check it in., I merged this into trunk and branch-2.  I am not totally sure what is happening with the 2.2 and 2.1 releases.  If you really want this to go into 2.1 and 2.2 I'll look at what it takes to get things merged in properly., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4457 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4457/])

, Thanks Robert. I don't think it's really necessary to merge it with 2.1 and 2.2 as long as it's in trunk., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #342 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/342/])
