[It looks like FileSystem's implementation of getContentSummary() really just uses getFileStatus()/listStatus().  If we get rid of the overridden version of getContentSummary() in FilterFileSystem and just fall back to the FileSystem implementation, would this work correctly, since FilterFileSystem does have overridden versions of getFileStatus()/listStatus()?, Sorry, looks like there are other related (fixed) issues: HADOOP-8014, Thanks to [~brandon li]:
