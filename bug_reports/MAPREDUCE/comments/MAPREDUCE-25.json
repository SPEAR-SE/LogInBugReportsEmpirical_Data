[That's right. The startTime is initialized just once inside TaskInProgress and the speculative check takes that into consideration. So for cases where a failed task is retried (let's say at least after a 1 minute interval), and another tasktracker asks for a task at around the same time instant, the check _(System.currentTimeMillis() - startTime >= SPECULATIVE_LAG)_  is going to return true, and a speculative instance will be launched almost simultaneously. Also i noticed there is a related field execStartTime. This is also updated only once. , Taken care in HADOOP-2141.]
