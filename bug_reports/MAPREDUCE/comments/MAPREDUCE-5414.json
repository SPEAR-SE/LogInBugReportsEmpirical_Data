This message is automatically generated., I was seeing the same failures. Applying the patch fixes it for me. You have just replaced the mocked objects with a real instance of Token. I am not familiar with tokens much, but that should be fine. One nit is you have used tabs for indenting the "TaskAttemptImpl taImpl =" line. Otherwise lgtm, and you can probably just pass in new Token(), instead of naming a variable and then passing it
, Updating patch as Ravi Prakash suggested.Thanks for your advise., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
