[FileBench is attempting to wield SequenceFileOutputFormat outside the context of a task.  SequenceFileOutputFormat assumes it's running within a task, as it invokes FileOutputFormat.getTaskOutputPath which assumes conf.get(JobContext.TASK_ATTEMPT_ID) is not going to return null.  However since we're not running in a task that property hasn't been setup and therefore there's no property set (and no task output path).

At first glance this looks like a bug in FileBench., [~jlowe] thanks a lot for taking a look into this issue..
