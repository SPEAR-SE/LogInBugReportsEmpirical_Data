Requires MR-3450. Unit tests for the port are part of 3450 - none included in this patch., Sid,
 This patch can go in as it is? Or need MR-3450 first? Can you explain the relation?

 Can we add a test case to make sure the Recovery Service doesnt crash and burn?, TestRecovery was faling silently without the previous patch (System.exit in the dispatcher).

This message is automatically generated., Would help to change the InlineDispatcher as well as it is used in various places. There is a default ctor for DrainDispatcher that needs to change as well. , bq. Would help to change the InlineDispatcher as well as it is used in various places. There is a default ctor for DrainDispatcher that needs to change as well.

Constructors in Inline/DranDispatcher to support the exit flag ? Had just left them to behave the way they currently do - exit in case of an exception. Was just fixing testRecovery and the RecoveryDispatcher in this patch., Ignore my previous comment. The above of changing the defaults for the inline and drain dispatchers to not exit could be addressed in MAPREDUCE-3489. , +1 looks good to me., I just committed this.
