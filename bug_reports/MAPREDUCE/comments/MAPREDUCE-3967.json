[Looks like the shell path should be generated using {{FileUtils.makeShellPath()}}. , Is it also possible to have some method for getting hold of the contents of default_container_executor.sh? When I try to run a job under YARN I currently get:

2012-05-05 12:15:04,220 INFO org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.DefaultContainerExecutor: launchContainer: [bash, -c, /tmp/yarn/usercache/Jacob/appcache/application_1336216450048_0001/container_1336216450048_0001_01_000001/default_container_executor.sh]
2012-05-05 12:15:04,253 WARN org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.DefaultContainerExecutor: Exit code from task is : 127

I am pretty sure that the 127 is because of this JIRA - bash can't find the script. But I imagine there are a few things that could go wrong under cygwin even if it could find it so it would be nice to somehow see the script it is trying to execute.]
