This message is automatically generated., Sandy, why not use a filter when reading files from the done/ dir to pick up only files with the right pattern? then you don't have to overload the comparator logic and you don't have to break the loop when the file does not match the pattern., Uploaded a new patch that uses a filter. Verified that it works on a pseudo-distributed cluster., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
