[As noted by others, this would also speed up the test-patch.sh process as we will just to need to find the number of warnings introduced by the patch., There was another JIRA (can't find it right now) on increasing javac's warning level to make sure we catch those., {quote}And to help contributors about what to do when an un-ignorable warning is spelt out by test-patch.sh, we should modify the output of test-patch.sh to point to src/test/findbugsExcludeFile.xml for suppressing any warnings.{quote}

Yes, correct. I meant not-fixable., test-patch.sh has been warning about findbugs for a while now.  Closing.]
