[Hi Amreshwari,

This issue seems to be invalid to me as, the constructor of JobTracker will make sure that the FileSystem is initialized i.e. the constructor takes the full responsibility of initializing the FileSystem.

The initialization is in an infinite loop which will make sure FileSystem is not null., NPE occurs only during initialization. The issue says we should throw IllegalStateException instead of NPE, in such case., Hi Amreshwari,
From my understanding, the while loop and try catch block takes care that the FileSystem must be initialised properly and then only JobTracker should proceed with other tasks.

Do you see any scenario where the org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker.getSystemDir() is called even before the fs is set?

Thanks & Regards,
Abhijit, As a Good Public API practice, we can make it throw IllegalStateException in case the fs is not initialised., Hi Amreshwari/Abhijit,

To call the public API *org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobTracker.getSystemDir()* we must have the instance of *JobTracker*. When the call to *JobTracker* constructor is made, the constructor makes sure that *FileSystem* is initialized.

Please let me know if I am missing any point where *FileSystem* will not be initialized but, the *JobTracker* will be.

As per my understanding if we introduce such checks, we will end up making null checks in all public APIs leading to too much defensive coding.]
