[Here's the MR patch that Omkar worked on via YARN-1203.
 - It adds a new config mapreduce.ssl.enable that can be set by MR AMs explicitly if MR users want to enable Https on AM webapp.

{code}
+  <name>mapreduce.ssl.enabled</name>
+  <value>false</value>
+  <description>
+       If enabled, MapReduce application master's http server will be
+       started with SSL enabled. Map reduce AM by default doesn't support SSL.
+       If MapReduce jobs want SSL support, it is the user's responsibility to
+       create and manage certificates, keystores and trust-stores with appropriate
+       permissions. This is only for MapReduce application master and is not used
+       by job history server. To enable encrypted shuffle this property is not
+       required, instead refer to (mapreduce.shuffle.ssl.enabled) property.
+  </description>
+</property>
