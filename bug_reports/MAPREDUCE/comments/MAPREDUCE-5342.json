[While it sounds nice to rename methods to reflect their behavior better, it would lead to breaking several user apps which rely on them. Having multiple methods with different names might be an overkill. So, it might be better just to leave them alone., I think the goal should be to refactor and correct mistakes as time goes on. While it is a noble goal to not break existing apps, it is also a noble goal to make it easier and intuitive for those who are going to use it afresh. Java itself has moved towards such a goal by deprecating methods that needed to be enhanced. Hadoop has deprecated quite a few methods as well. All Job constructors are deprecated. ]
