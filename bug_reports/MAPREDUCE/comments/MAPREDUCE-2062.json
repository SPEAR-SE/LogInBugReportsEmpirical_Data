[another thing we have noticed is that progress rate (especially the reducer's) is usually pretty low (compared to mean) when the task initially starts (which causes lots of false speculations). However - the absolute progress rate of the speculated tasks is not bad at all (most of the speculated tasks had a progress rate that would have taken them to 100% within 3-4 minutes). 

One heuristic that seemed obvious after looking at this was that we should have a upper bound on the progress rate - where above that progress rate - speculation does not make sense (regardless of mean/stddev). The proposal is to be able to configure this as a 'minimum_duration' setting on mappers/reducers. if the mapper/reducer is projected to finish within this duration - no speculation will be done. setting the duration to a small number like 3-4 minutes would weed out a lot of excessive speculators., Spec exec got majorly overhauled. Closing., can someone point me to where it got done elsewhere?

note - as the title states - this was after incorporating HADOOP-2141 which was the major overhaul of speculative exeution]
