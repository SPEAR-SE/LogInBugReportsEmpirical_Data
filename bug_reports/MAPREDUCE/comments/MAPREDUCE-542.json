[How do you define the "order of scheduling", is it just at the time the method is called? The thing is that the order may change later when some jobs finish some tasks and end up below their fair share., Yes, it is true that in the fairshare scheduler, the order of jobs is much more dynamic than the other two schedulers. But still showing in the order at the time of the method call might help to give a better picture than what is giving currently, where the order in which the jobs are being considered has no relation to what is displayed.]
