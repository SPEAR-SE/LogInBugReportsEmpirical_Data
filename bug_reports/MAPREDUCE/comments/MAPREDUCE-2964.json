[This seems to fail in Hudson but not dev machines. Any idea what might be causing it?, I think there was some issue with the jenkins nightly pulling different/stale common/hdfs artifacts for the build.
@Giri would cleaning the ivy cache on the machine be helpful? I checked the command line for jenkins at https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit, seems fine to me., Just fixed this. No longer an issue on trunk builds., bq. Just fixed this. No longer an issue on trunk builds.
Thanks a ton, Mahadev, was getting sick of watching the builds fail for ever :)]
