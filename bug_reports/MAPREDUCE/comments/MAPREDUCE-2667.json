[The issue here seems to be even though the unregister routine in the RMCommunicator is setting the state to KILLED and
then calls finishApplicationMaster, the finishApplicationMaster is just sending the FINISHED event which isn't handled
by the ApplicationImpl when it is in the RUNNING state.  So basically the killed state that got set is ignored.
