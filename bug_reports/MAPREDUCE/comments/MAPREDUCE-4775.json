[OK so I missed some of the code in shuffleScheduler.checkReducerHealth(). The stall check is in there, but the previous check for a single map attempt is completely useless at this point. Dropping the severity accordingly.
Robert Joseph Evans added a comment.  I am also confused why a reducer could be stalled for over an hour (MAPREDUCE-4772) and not be killed. I will look into that here too.
