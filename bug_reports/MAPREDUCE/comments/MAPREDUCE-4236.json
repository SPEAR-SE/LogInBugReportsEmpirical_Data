[All except org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.security.TestJHSSecurity are failing due to .staging directory not being found, might be an environment issue.

TestJHSSecurity is failing with:

{noformat}
org.apache.hadoop.yarn.YarnException: Error creating done directory: [file:/tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/history/done]
  at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.hs.HistoryFileManager.init(HistoryFileManager.java:398)
{noformat}

... again might be my box., We saw these issues on the build machines a while back, and Giri fixed it by fixing some file/directory permissions.  I don't really know what he did to fix it though.  I believe that it shows up when the tests are run by a different user on the same box.  /tmp/hadoop-yarn/... is now owned by the wrong person and the permissions are locked down so no one else can replace it., Mostly an env. issue. Closing for now.]
