[Stripping out the threading info (pollsys, etc) shows that the tasks are in a tight loop around manipulating the log files (see tightloop.txt).

I'm also attaching the syslog and stderr logs from this task to see if that helps to figure out where we're missing a thread needing to get killed., FWIW, all of the other zombie tasks appear to have the same loop.

It would be good if someone can confirm the same pattern on non-Solaris.  I have a suspicion that the zombie tasks at Y! are showing the same behavio(u)r., Do you have a jstack from the JVM?, As reqeusted, a jstack., I can confirm that on Debian servers too.
Running on Java (build 1.6.0_22-b04).

We "hotfixed" it with a cronjob that kills all tasks that are not listed in the node's tasktracker.
Never the less we need a real fix for it too ;), So I had some time to test a bit. 
I have a 0.20.2 Hadoop on my ubuntu netbook and same virtual machine running on the cluster servers.

I implemented a WordCount memory leak that will immediately fail the task. So what's the suprise? There are no zombies!
That is a really strange problem..., It is easier to just pkill -9 java tasks at regular intervals than fix this.]
