[If the proxy can tell from the state of the application that the AM has not launched yet, we should return an appropriate page.  Either way the error "the MRAppMaster died before writing anything" does not seem to be an appropriate error message in all cases that it is being returned for., This fixes the issue. Now I am checking the FinalApplicationStatus too to figure out if the AM has completed / hasn't started, @Bobby: I'm still using the 404 response which I think is reasonable. Please let me know if that isn't ideal., Removing a stray logging statement =D, A few comments:

* In the patch if the path is N/A and the status is SUCCEEDED the proxy will still try to load "N/A".
* For some reason the proxy which is part of yarn, and not MR is returning an error message that is MR specific.  

Because we will always return a 404 error in this case, I would prefer to see something like

{code}
if(applicationReport.getOriginalTrackingUrl().equals("N/A")) {
    String message;
    switch(applicationReport.getFinalApplicationStatus()) {
        case FAILED:
        case KILLED:
        case SUCCEEDED:
            message = "The requested application exited before setting a tracking URL.";
            break;
        case UNDEFINED:
            message = "The requested application does not appear to be running yet, and has not set a tracking URL.";
            break;
        default:
            //This should never happen, but just to be safe
            message = "The requested application has not set a tracking URL.";
            break;
    }
    noFound(resp, message);
    return;
}
{code}

If you would prefer to throw an exception in the default case that would be good too. , Thanks for the review and comments Bobby!
