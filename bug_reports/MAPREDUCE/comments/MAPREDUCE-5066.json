[Job notification also exists in 2.x which may face the same set of issues. , Attaching the branch-1 compatible patch. 

A few notes:
 - Introduced missing unittests for the JobEndNotifier that cover most of its functionality
 - Added a test case that targets the problem from the Jira
 - Fixed a bug in how retry count it computed (we had an extra retry attempt previously), bq. Job notification also exists in 2.x which may face the same set of issues.
Thanks Hitesh, it should be strait forward to rebase the patch for 2.x branch. Will do so once the current patch is reviewed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Minor patch update, factoring common unittest code into utility methods., Ivan - the patch looks good. You'll need to port this to branch-1 and branch-2(trunk).

Also, if you could minimize formatting changes it will make it easier to review (for future ref). Thanks!, bq. You'll need to port this to branch-1 and branch-2(trunk).
Thanks for reviewing Arun! Will attach branch-1 and branch-2 compatible patches in a bit.

bq. Also, if you could minimize formatting changes it will make it easier to review (for future ref). Thanks!
Sounds good, thanks. I noticed that formatting was incorrect so I intentionally made this change :) Will avoid doing formatting changes with bugfixes going forward., Hi Arun,

I am attaching branch-1-win/branch-1 and branch-2 compatible patches.

A few notes on the patches:
 - Fixed a test verification issue in branch-1-win.3.patch
 - branch-1 and branch-1-win patches are fully compatible (and equivalent)
 - Branch-2 codebase changed significantly and I did my best effort to find the appropriate forward patch. There are two implementations of the JobEndNotifier, mapred#JobEndNotifier (based on the one from branch-1 but simplified) and mapreduce.v2.app#JobEndNotifier (new implementation). The former is used in the LocalJobRunner and latter in the MR AppMaster. In my patch I did the following:
    *a.* Applied the bugfixes to current state of mapred#JobEndNotifier and included the corresponding unittests
    *b.* Given that mapreduce.v2.app#JobEndNotifier already sets the timeout to 5 seconds, I did the same in mapred#JobEndNotifier. In other words, I did not introduce a config knob that would allow the timeout to be configurable. My reasoning was that in branch-1, people might see 5 second timeout as a regression and might want to change it to a different value. In trunk, given that the timeout is already set to 5 seconds, this should be fine until proved otherwise. Please advise if you think this is needed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Thx!
, [~ivanmi] - sorry for the delay. Minor nit: mapred.job.end.notification.timeout should be mapreduce.job.end.notification.timeout; also we need to use the same config in MR2 too., Thanks for the review Arun!
