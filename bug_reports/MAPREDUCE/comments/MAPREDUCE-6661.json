[[~sultan] hostLocalAssigned is the # of mappers that ran on nodes where their input is also stored locally. A mapper can be scheduled to run on data-local nodes, rack-local nodes or anywhere in the cluster. The fact that hostLocalAssigned remains zero while rackLocalAssinged gets updated simply indicates that the mappers were not able to be scheduled on data-local nodes, so they were run on rack-local nodes.]
