This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good. Just to be on the safer side, I suggest some sanity testing of security related stuff including queue acls with mapred.acls.enabled set to (a) true and (b) false before commit., MAPREDUCE-1749 broke this patch slightly. Going to upload an updated patch., I did sanity tests as suggested by Ravi with two queues. The machinery is all well-oiled. Will resubmit it to Hudson one more time just to be sure., -1 overall.
