[[~aw] Any thoughts on this issue?, Hi [~ajithshetty], Can I take this issue if you didn't start working on it yet? I have a patch ready for this issue. thanks, Hi [~zxu]

Sorry for delay, had already worked on it. :) Please let me know if you have a different approach, *org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobSubmitter.submitJobInternal(Job, Cluster)* adds a generated shuffle key in case the credentials are not set, in case of the LocalJobRunner, this need to be propogated. Fixed accordingly, Thanks for working on this issue [~ajithshetty]! I verified your patch, It doesn't work. I attached the test I used for the verification.
The culprit of the issue is not missing credentials but missing SecretKey {{ENC_SPILL_KEY}}.
UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser().getCredentials() will never return null based on the following code.
{code}
  public Credentials getCredentials() {
    synchronized (subject) {
      Credentials creds = new Credentials(getCredentialsInternal());
      Iterator<Token<?>> iter = creds.getAllTokens().iterator();
      while (iter.hasNext()) {
        if (iter.next() instanceof Token.PrivateToken) {
          iter.remove();
        }
      }
      return creds;
    }
  }
{code}

Since credentials is not null in {{getSecretKey}}, {{credentials.getSecretKey(ENC_SPILL_KEY)}} must be null which triggered the NPE.
{code}
  private static byte[] getEncryptionKey() throws IOException {
    return TokenCache.getEncryptedSpillKey(UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser()
            .getCredentials());
  }
  public static byte[] getEncryptedSpillKey(Credentials credentials) {
    return getSecretKey(credentials, ENC_SPILL_KEY);
  }
  public static byte[] getSecretKey(Credentials credentials, Text alias) {
    if(credentials == null)
      return null;
    return credentials.getSecretKey(alias);
  }
{code}

I attached a patch MAPREDUCE-6452.000.patch which should fix this issue. The patch includes a test case to reproduce this issue. It sets the SecretKey {{ENC_SPILL_KEY}} in the credentials of current user by calling {{TokenCache.setEncryptedSpillKey}} 
By the way, thanks [~bibinchundatt] for reporting this issue., Hi [~zxu]

Yes, i wanted to say that *secretKeysMap* set in a credential object, is not propagated. In my scenario, i have *getSecretKey(credentials, SHUFFLE_TOKEN)* returned null, because the map is empty. 
The reason my patch is failing your test case is
In hadoop < 2.7.1, the *org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.CryptoUtils.getEncryptionKey()* depends on SHUFFLE_TOKEN, so you patch will have problem in that version and in hadoop >= 2.7.1 it depends on ENC_SPILL_KEY as you said.

I had patched it for a older version, I see that you have added a test case, feel free to assign to yourself, Agree with Ajith S,  even i have noticed the same thing., thanks [~ajithshetty] and [~mohdshahidkhan] for the clarification, I see the commit "Fixing MR intermediate spills.": https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/6b710a42e00acca405e085724c89cda016cf7442 
change:
{code}
private static byte[] getEncryptionKey() throws IOException {
    return TokenCache. getShuffleSecretKey(UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser()
            .getCredentials());
  }
{code}
To
{code}
private static byte[] getEncryptionKey() throws IOException {
    return TokenCache.getEncryptedSpillKey(UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser()
            .getCredentials());
  }
{code}

The change "Fixing MR intermediate spills." is added at 2.7.1 release. But the stack trace from this JIRA is based on the code 2.7.1 or later
because 
{code}
at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.CryptoUtils.wrapIfNecessary(CryptoUtils.java:112)
{code}
doesn't match 2.7.0 code base., I think this issue will depend on the commit "Fixing MR intermediate spills.": 
https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/6b710a42e00acca405e085724c89cda016cf7442
Without the change from "Fixing MR intermediate spills.", the patch for this issue may not work correctly.
, +1 for  zhihai xu patch for the branch 2.7.1 , trunk and branch-2., Thanks for the patch [~zxu] and good catch [~bibinchundatt].
+1 pending jenkins.., Hi [~zxu]

Patch looks great, a small suggestion, currently i see *ENC_SPILL_KEY* being also set at *org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.MRAppMaster.initJobCredentialsAndUGI(Configuration)* so can we push this and your changes to a common location like *org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobSubmitter.submitJobInternal(Job, Cluster)*, can be overlooked, i am still ok with your patch without this suggestion :), \\
