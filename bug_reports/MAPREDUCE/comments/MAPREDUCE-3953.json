[My proposal is to fix the NPE issue and allow Gridmix to simulate such jobs ( succeeded-jobs-with-task-failures of trace file). Because, currently Gridmix doesn't simulate failed tasks, those tasks will pass in simulated job and their inputDataSize and outputDataSize is assumed to be zero., Attaching patch with the code changes mentioned in the previous comment., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1. Patch looks good to me. Not sure why the patch failed. Ravi, can you kindly update the test-patch and junit test results., Gridmix unit tests passed on my local machine. test-patch seems to be not working properly. That is why it gave that error above. I just committed the patch to trunk. Thanks Amar for the review., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1984 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1984/])
