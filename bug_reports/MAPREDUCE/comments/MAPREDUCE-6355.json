[Here's a snippet from a 2.5 client submitting a sleep job using 2.5 jars for the job on a 2.6 cluster:

{noformat}, Dropping 2.6.1-candidate label, 2.6.1 is out now. Targetting 2.6.2 / 2.7.2., Targeting 2.6.3 now that 2.6.2 has shipped., Similar to YARN-3575, this token format-change (YARN-668) was a _"necessary evil"_ to support rolling-upgrades starting Hadoop 2.6. I requested offline that this be filed largely for documentation concerns.

There is only one way sites can avoid this incompatibility: all apps are to be upgraded to 2.6+ once you migrate your cluster to 2.6+ from < 2.6.

We *can* have an elaborate fix where the 2.5 clients tells YARN of its version so that RM can generate and propagate the right token-format, but at this stage, I am not sure of its value. Closing this for now as won't fix. Please reopen if you disagree. Thanks.
