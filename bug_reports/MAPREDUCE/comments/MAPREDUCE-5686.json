[Have you searched for this error string online to see if others have found it before?, As pointed out on the other JIRAs you have filed, _please_ ask these kinds of questions on the [user@ mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User].  JIRA is for Hadoop developers to track bugs and is not a channel for general user support.  That is why the user@ mailing list exists.

The problem here is the same type of problem you reported in MAPREDUCE-5666 and MAPREDUCE-5668.  It looks like you are compiling against a later version of Hadoop than you are running on, and that is not supported.]
