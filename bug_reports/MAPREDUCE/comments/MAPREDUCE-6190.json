[We seem to be having the same Problem in Amazon AWS running their "amazon 2.4.0" distribution.
Does anyone know of a workaround that doesn't involve manually killing tasks?, [~amalhotra159] [~tannin]
Would mind attaching full log of MRAppMaster. And did anyone observe scenario mentioned in YARN-1680?, I came across this issue after modifying the value of the YARN config property "mapreduce.map.cpu.vcores" to anything higher than the default, which is "1". Setting the value back to "1" resolved this issue., Hi, we are facing the same issue with both hadoop 2.4.0 and 2.6.0 in aws emr. Did you find any solution for this problem?  ]
