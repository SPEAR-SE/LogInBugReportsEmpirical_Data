[There needs to be more information on this report to diagnose if there's a real issue here.  You will need to check the RM logs to see why it decided to respond to the AM as being unrecognized.  One theory is the AM could have been running on a node where the nodemanager crashed.  If that occurs then the RM will eventually expire the nodemanager due to lack of heartbeats and consider all of the containers on that node lost.  When the AM proceeds to heartbeat to the RM I would expect the RM to reply that the AM is no longer recognized since the RM considers that app attempt dead (being on a lost node).  Having the AM shut down (without unregistering!) is appropriate in that case.
