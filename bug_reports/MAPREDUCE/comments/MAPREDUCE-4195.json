[The fix in MAPREDUCE-3674 was incomplete. In src/webapps/job/jobqueue_details.jsp, a null check is needed for schedInfo, when the queueName is invalid. This fix makes sure that a meaningful info is printed instead of NPE., Thanks for filing this Gera. Usually one's never supposed to access this URL directly (its not documented to). Otherwise your patch looks fine to me, to avoid null objects in the JSP.

You've not granted ASF the rights to use your patch. If you're willing to contribute this into our repos, please re-upload with the grant added (it appears as a radio option in the bottom of attach-file dialog).

Many thanks for doing this!, Hi Harsh,

Yes, I am aware that this is not a documented way but this obviously has happened given MAPREDUCE-3674.

"Grant license to ASF" is selected.

Thanks,

Gera, +1, Thanks Gera. Committed to branch-1, Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
