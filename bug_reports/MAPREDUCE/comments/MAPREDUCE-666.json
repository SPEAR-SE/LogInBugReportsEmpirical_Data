[Two possible solutions:
 1) Remove job scheduling information completely from the jobtracker.jsp and retain it only on the per job jobdetails.jsp page.
 2) Have a short form for jobtracker.jsp and a long form for the jobdetails.jsp.

To keep things simple, I am +1 for (1) above. Comments?
, Have you considered adding some kind of schedulingdetails.jsp page to allow schedulers to post their information? Seeing the information on one page is very useful for debugging and administration, but I agree that including it on jobtracker.jsp makes that UI clunky. I think the fair scheduler's page strikes a decent balance between scheduler details and readability, but it does this by listing less info about each job than jobtracker.jsp., I propose that we fix this in 0.21. On some of the clusters, the jobtracker.jsp gets really long when scheduling information per job is used., Stale.]
