[I think this is related to HADOOP-6938. I've upload a patch for it., I think it is related to Client callinb ConnectionId.getRemotePrincipal()  for non-secure cluster.
This call should be conditioned by UGI.securityEnabled() constrain.

So the actual fix will be in HADOOP-COMMON., it should be fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-6938, I ran TestMRCLI with the latest patch in HADOOP-6938, it passed. , Test passes after the commit of HADOOP-6938. Closing it as duplicate.]
