[Patch looks good.
Affects 0.20-security-* branches as well.

FSDataOutputStream.getPos is not thread safe but then again DataOutPutStream.size does not seem to be thread safe either.
Even through the DataOutPutStream.write method is synchronized, FSDataOutputStrem.write is not synchronized.
This does not seem to be an issue in the current code path because createSplitFiles does not expose out.
, Is this tested against 0.20.205 and trunk?, Sorry, hit the wrong button - assigning to Ming., It is tested on 0.20-security-* branches. Testing on 0.22 will be conducted later., Ming, I can put this into 0.20.205 only after commit to trunk... unless this issue doesn't exist in trunk. Help, pls?, Arun, the bug is still in the trunk. Thanks., Here is the patch for 0.22. It passes all unit tests except for known buggy test.

[junit] Test org.apache.hadoop.raid.TestRaidNode FAILED
