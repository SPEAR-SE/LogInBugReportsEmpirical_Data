[Consider this failure case:
 - Two mapred-local-dirs "/a/b/c/ML1" and "/a/b/c/ML2".
 - TT first creates userdir Alice in both the dirs, i.e. "/a/b/c/ML1/taskTracker/Alice" and "/a/b/c/ML2/taskTracker/Alice"
 - TT then launched LinuxTaskController for 'securifying' the user-dirs aka MAPREDUCE-856.
 - LinuxTaskController then successfully changes ownership of "/a/b/c/ML1/taskTracker/Alice" to "Alice:tt_group" but then fails on changing ownership of "/a/b/c/ML2/taskTracker/Alice" due to a transitory disk problem.

The above result in the failure of current task because of a failed INITIALIZE_USER operation.
Not just that, every other task of Alice that ever comes on this TT will try INITIALIZE_USER and fail because LinuxTaskController see "Alice:tt_group" on "/a/b/c/ML1/taskTracker/Alice" and fails saying the file is not owned by TT.

This can otherwise only be rectified when TT restarts/reinits and moves and deletes the old mapred-local-dirs., Fixed as part of MAPREDUCE-1609.]
