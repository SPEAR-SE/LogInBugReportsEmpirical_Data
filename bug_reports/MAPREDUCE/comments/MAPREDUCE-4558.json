[Trivial patch - which changes the check to 3 TTs instead of 2. (Also disables the test)

The test passes, but ends up generating cyclic attempt dir symlinks, which cause subsequent ant operations to fail.

+1, this test seems like it needs more work. Mayank, will you have time to look at this? Thanks.

, Pinging Mayank _after_ adding him to the watch list... that should help! :), yeah sure, I can take a look. 

Sid,

Did you create a JIRA or I can do that as well?

Thanks,
Mayank, Committed to branch-1. Thanks for the review Arun.

Mayank, I've created MAPREDUCE-4563 for the symlinks.., Matt - if you don't mind, I'd like to merge this into branch-1.1 since it's been well baked-in. Thoughts?, I merged this to branch-1.1 too., Accepted., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
