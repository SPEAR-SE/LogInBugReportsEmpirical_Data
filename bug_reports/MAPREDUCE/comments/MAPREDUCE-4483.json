This message is automatically generated., Alejandro - Are you okay with this patch?, +1 on the trunk patch. when merging into branch-2 the POM version of the parent/project should be changed to the branch-2 version number (then we take care of the other issue as well)., Alejandro is +1 for the patch and so am I.  I'll check this in, and I will be sure to update the revision before checking it into branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2540 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2540/])
