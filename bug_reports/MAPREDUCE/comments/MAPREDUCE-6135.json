[This is a well known issue in YARN covered by a number of other JIRAs and can also happen even if the AM never even has a chance to run, see MAPREDUCE-5502.  Other related JIRAs include MAPREDUCE-4559 and MAPREDUCE-4428., Thanks, Jason. Resolve this as dup. Will continue the discussion over at MAPREDUCE-5502. It looks like Robert in MAPREDUCE-4428 also mentioned the approach of rerun AM for cleanup.]
