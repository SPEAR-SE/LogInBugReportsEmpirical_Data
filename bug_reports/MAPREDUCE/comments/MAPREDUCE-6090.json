[By default, only core-default and core-site are loaded unless you end up calling something else that loads other site/default files.  In this call, we try to get the address from the Configuration before something else (UserGroupInformation) causes mapred-default/site to be loaded, so we get the default address, which is 0.0.0.0:10033.  In the case where we don't pass any user argument, it determines the current user by calling a method in UserGroupInformation, which causes mapred-default/site to be loaded; and this happens before we try to get the address -- so it works in this case., The patch simply adds mapred-default and mapred-site to be loaded when HSAdmin gets loaded., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the report and patch, Robert!  Rather than an explicit static block that replicates the logic in JobConf, it'd be cleaner if HSAdmin simply reused that logic by expecting a JobConf rather than a Configuration.  The constructor that takes a conf argument should expect a JobConf, and the main() method could construct the HSAdmin object with a JobConf rather than relying on ToolRunner to pass the conf., Thanks for taking a look Jason; that makes sense.  The new patch uses a JobConf., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
