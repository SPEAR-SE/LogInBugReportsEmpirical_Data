[This is something better sent to the [Hadoop User mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User] rather than JIRA.

The archive was untarred as requested, but it was untarred into a directory (named "test" per the '#test' URI fragment in the archive argument).  An archive is always unpacked into a directory specific to that archive, and the distributed cache does not support unpacking directly into the task's working directory.  If you need files placed in the task working directory then you will need to specify them separately (e.g.: via the "-files" directive)., I should have clarified that /tmp/hadoop-hadoop/nm-local-dir/usercache/hadoop/filecache/116/test.tgz in the example above is actually a directory and not an archive.  Archives by default are unpacked into a directory named after the archive name, although this can be renamed in the task's working directory via the URI fragment (e.g.: '#test' in the example above).  So the files in your example should be available via test/test.1.txt and test/test.2.txt from the task's current working directory. , Thank you very much, it helps. 
And sorry for sending here, I was not sure.]
