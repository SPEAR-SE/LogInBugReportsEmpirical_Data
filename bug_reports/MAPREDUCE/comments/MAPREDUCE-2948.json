[Milind,
  I've been seeing the same issue. Let me know if you need any help fixing this. I'd really like this to be fixed ASAP., I think we can just remove the test case since it cant be supported with what we have currently. I'd suggest removing it for now, unless anyone objects. Ill open a jira to write a unit test for running streaming jobs for as a different user in MRv2 but I dont think its worthwhile to fix the current testcase in 0.23 atleast.

, +1, Here's a patch for 23 and trunk. Ill do the same for 0.22 when commit.

will just svn delete the files., 0.22 changes., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
