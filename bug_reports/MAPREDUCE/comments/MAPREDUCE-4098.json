This message is automatically generated., Thanks Tucu!

The environment CLASSPATH is populated using the value for YarnConfiguration.YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH from yarn-default.xml and then the test again checks if it contains the classpath from the YarnConfiguration.YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH value, so the test will always succeed regardless of the value set for YarnConfiguration.YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH. 

Do we need to keep the check against the hardcoded classpath values so the test will fail if they were changed in yarn-default.xml? , So you still check for "contains" instead of equality (per your changes), but the check will remain against hardcoded classpath values?, @Ahmed, as you indicated, the new assertion verifies that the YARN_APPLICATION_CLASSPATH value is in the resulting classpath. If we change the default value, the test will still pass. This seems more correct than checking against a hardcoded value. I don't think we need check for hardcoded values, at least not in this test. If you see value in that, we should have an additional test checking the hardcoded value; personally I don't think such test is needed. Regarding your second comment, the check for contains is because the classpath is massaged to prefix '$PWD' and to postfix 'job.jar' and '$PWD/*'., +1, this looks good to me. Applied and test passes.

There are reported test failures. I went over them but they appear unrelated to this change. If you too reach the same conclusion, please do state so and then resolve., +1 thanks tucu., Thanks Harsh. Yes, test failures seem unrelated, it looks like a zombie JVM with minicluster is around (YARN minicluster uses fixed ports), committed to trunk and branch-2, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2065 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2065/])
