[Resolving this umbrella JIRA. RM restart has largely been nearly complete/stable in YARN, with MR working equally well in tandem since this ticket was opened, what with its ultimate usage for rolling-upgrades (YARN-666).
 - As new issues come in, we can open new tickets.
 - Will leave the one open sub-task as it is.
 - No fix-version as this was done across releases.]
