[I used {{git bisect}} and found this issue was broken by MAPREDUCE-6174., Thanks for pinging [~ajisakaa]. Taking a look!, In MAPREDUCE-6174, [~eepayne] made sure that IFileInputStream is closed after shuffle. This was not the case before, but I do think it's a good idea. But we should not close the wrapped physical stream because it shared for all outputs coming from the same node., Thanks [~jira.shegalov] for taking this issue. The uploaded patch looks to be for HDFS-8591. Would you upload a patch for this issue?, [~jira.shegalov] do you mind,If I give patch..?, \\

This message was automatically generated., Will give patch to fix the checkstyle.., Uploading my patch for completeness. Don't mind if we go with [~brahmareddy]'s, either. , As a pattern, having close looks better to me, although in this case it ends doing nothing because there is no readahead and I disabled the wrapped stream close . [~eepayne], [~jlowe], do you have a preference?, Thanks [~jira.shegalov] and [~brahmareddy] for creating the patch. In Gera's patch, if {{inOwner}} is set to false, we cannot close the wrapped stream when an exception occurs. Therefore I prefer Brahma's one.
Some comments for Brahma's patch.
1. Would you please catch {{IOException}} in {{IFileWrappedMapOutput#shuffle}}? In the catch clause, we should close the wrapped stream and re-throw the exception.
2. Would you remove unused imports from TestReduceFetchFromPartialMem.java and TestFetcher.java?, bq. if inOwner is set to false, we cannot close the wrapped stream when an exception occurs. 

A good pattern is when the stream open API consumer closes the stream. In IFlileInputStream for shuffle, the stream is opened outside, and therefore should be and is closed outside., Thanks a lot [~ajisakaa] , I will address your comments and update the patch soon.., bq. A good pattern is when the stream open API consumer closes the stream. In IFlileInputStream for shuffle, the stream is opened outside, and therefore should be and is closed outside.
Thanks [~jira.shegalov] for the comment. I agree with you that the pattern is good. However, before MAPREDUCE-6174, the stream is closed when IOException occurs. Can we create a separate jira for improving the pattern?, \\

Thanks for the patch [~brahmareddy]. Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the comments. 

We don't need to do catch-rethrow. We can use abort. I also undid import reorg changes in 002. Here 003., \\

This message was automatically generated., Sorry for arriving late.  I'm a bit confused on the latest patch.  We're going to close the IFileInputStream but only when something fails?  That seems odd.  In addition, note that IFileInputStream.close is not trivial -- it will consume the rest of the stream to verify the checksum, but we don't care since we're only trying to close when something else went wrong.  At that point the checksum being valid is not important, correct?  I'm thinking of a scenario where writing to the local disk fails early in a very large transfer.  We don't want to spend time reading the rest of the data, rather we just want to abandon the transfer and move on., Hi [~jlowe], do you mean {{iFin}} in the 003 patch should be changed to the wrapped stream?
{code:title=IFileWrappedMapOutput.java}
  @Override
  public void abort() {
    IOUtils.cleanup(LOG, iFin);
  }
{code}
I'm +1 for doing this., Attaching a sample patch to skip {{IFileInputStream#close}}., \\

This message was automatically generated., bq.  do you mean iFin in the 003 patch should be changed to the wrapped stream?

Actually no, I'm not a big fan of that approach either.  Again, it seems weird to me that we're closing the stream only sometimes, and that sometimes is only when something fails.  IMHO the code that is fielding the error and calling abort should be the one closing the stream, as this is likely the one that passed the stream into the map output in the first place.  As Gera mentioned above, it's simplest if the code that opens the stream closes the stream.  It gets confusing when the ownership is conditional like this.
, bq. We don't want to spend time reading the rest of the data, rather we just want to abandon the transfer and move on.
Good point that we don't care about checksum verification. Initially I was only worried about the read-ahead pool but it's not used for the shuffled data arriving via a TCP socket., 005: Minimum patch to bring close closer to open :).

Also fixing potential related file handle leak in LocalFetcher, \\

This message was automatically generated., +1, the latest simple patch looks good to me. Thanks [~jlowe] for the comment and [~jira.shegalov] for updating the patch., I suspect that connection.disconnect() is already closing the underlying input stream, but it shouldn't hurt if we close it early just in case it doesn't.
