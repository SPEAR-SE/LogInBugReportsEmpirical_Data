[This lead to MAPREDUCE-1022 ..., Attaching patch to add this to the compilation step. This also exposes the fact that as-is, some contribs do not compile their tests correctly due to missing ivy deps. Fixed those too., Note: there are no new tests introduced by this patch because it's a buildsystem fix. I manually tested by introducing a syntax error in Sqoop's code and verifying that the package build failed; removing the syntax error allowed the build to proceed successfully., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The build seemed to interrupt midway through. Recycling status to try Hudson again.

I suspect that there are additional javac warnings because code which previously was not being compiled by Hudson (notably, the data_join and index contrib modules) is now enabled.  This patch does not change any Java code, so can't introduce javac warnings in its own right., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The failing test has been doing so for a few builds now; unrelated to this patch., I've just committed this. Thanks Aaron!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #285 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/285/])
    MAPREDUCE-1031. ant tar target doens't seem to compile tests in contrib projects. Contributed by Aaron Kimball.
