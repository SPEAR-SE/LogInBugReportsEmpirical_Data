[ApplicationAttemptID was originally introduced for the same reason, it has appId, clusterTimeStamp and failcount(attemptId).

Passing it via environment is the correct API and the original intention (I had a TODO in AMLauncher :) ), Hey Vinod,

Hehe, yeah I came across that TODO. I also agree that environment variable is the right way to do this. The question I have is, do we only need to pass the attempt ID, or do we also need to pass the app ID and cluster timestamp? It seems to me that we need all three, unless I'm missing something (which I probably am).

Cheers,
Chris, We will pass ApplicationAttemptID serialized as a string of the form {{appattempt_$clusterTimeStamp_$appId_$attemptId}}. You can use YARN's TypeConverter utilities to convert it back into a record and use any/all of the fields., +1 on passing ApplicationAttemptID as a string in the env as Vinod suggested., Sweet. Sounds good., Attaching patch that should fix this.
 - Introduced "APPLICATION_ATTEMPT_ID_ENV" environmental variable.
 - Changed MRAppMaster to use the same.
 - Added a test that should verify this. Knocked off an old, commented-out test that became redundant with my new one., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
