[It is coming due to the hard-coded values in the below code,

{code:title=TypeConverter.java|borderStyle=solid}
public static JobStatus fromYarn(ApplicationReport application,
      String jobFile) {
    String trackingUrl = application.getTrackingUrl();
    trackingUrl = trackingUrl == null ? "" : trackingUrl;
    JobStatus jobStatus =
      new JobStatus(
          TypeConverter.fromYarn(application.getApplicationId()),
          0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f, 0.0f,
          TypeConverter.fromYarn(application.getYarnApplicationState(), 
	  application.getFinalApplicationStatus()),
          org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobPriority.NORMAL,
          application.getUser(), application.getName(),
          application.getQueue(), jobFile, trackingUrl, false
      );
    jobStatus.setSchedulingInfo(trackingUrl); // Set AM tracking url

{code} 

Here we don't have any provision to get the map and reduce progresses from RM. 

It doesn't look good to show these hard-coded values always to the user when they use JobClient.getAllJobs() API.


Any thoughts?, Marking as unassigned, should anyone be interested in working on it.

Will come back to this if still available when time permits., The issue is still exist in the latest code base. This issue require more discussion on whether to change the hard coded values which may break comatibility for the MR client OR bring out a new design to handle this dielema. If not planning to fix , I think this can be closed as wont fix.]
