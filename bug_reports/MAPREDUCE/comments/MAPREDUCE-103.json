[So this feature (or bug) to do with the whole of TaskTracker's env being passed to the child has always been there. The fix to this issue (after an offline discussion with Owen) is:
1) Determine what env vars can be whitelisted
2) Disable variable substitution for the non-whitelisted ones and only do a pass-through (if the user passes them via -Dmapred.child.env), Something similar is done today. For LD_LIBRARY_PATH, we prepend the pwd value (work dir) and pass it to the child env. Putting LD_LIBRARY_PATH in the white listed set makes sense now. Wondering if 
LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$PWD:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH also makes sense and helps us keep it simple and generic. Thoughts?, task-controller/container-executor should have fixed this. Closing.]
