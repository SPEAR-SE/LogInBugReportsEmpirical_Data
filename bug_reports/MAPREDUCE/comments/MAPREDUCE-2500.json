[Factories changed to use a ConcurrentMap - doesn't really matter if two parallel calls end up creating their own instances (instead of using a cached copy).

Changed FactoryProvider to use a static configuration object if none is provided (instead of creating a configuration each time)

Changed TypeConverter to use a static RecordFactory. (To be changed later to use a provided recordFactory), Same as the previous patch - with the apache license added., +1, lgtm., Minor nits:

# The ctor lookup code probably should save the lookup result instead make another cache.get call.
# You can probably get rid of the null in clazz.getConstructor(null) in RecordFactoryPBImpl to avoid the vararg warning., Thanks for taking a look Luke.

Patch with the suggested changes., I just pushed this to MR-279. thanks sid and luke!]
