[We need to investigate further, but maybe you can set it to ${user} in mapred-site.xml or better, mapred-default.xml?, One possible, simple fix., Vinod - can we do better? , Seems a little hacky, but +1 for now unless Vinod has a better solution., Quick-fix for now. We should improve this soon., Let's commit it as is.

IIRC, the MR AM uses this config name for getting user-name. We can fix it correctly by making RM pass the user-name to AM and making AM use that, but I'll create a separate ticket for doing that way.

+1 for the patch, for now., Just committed this. Thanks Arun., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1163 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1163/])
