[There was a long discussion about this at MAPREDUCE-6704.  They ended up settling on documenting the issue., Thanks Ray. Should we just close this then? Or are the docs still lacking in some way?, The ClusterSetup and SingleCluster documents were updated to do proper setup and there was a lot of discussion about the "right" way to deal with this.  It's not obvious that missing the new setting will cause the above error.  We don't really have any "common error messages for debugging" documentation.

[~djp], I don't think we'll be able to update the defaults without getting into the same discussions and I don't have any newer suggestions offhand., [~djp] is Ray's explanation satisfactory? Wondering if we can close this, it's one of two unassigned blockers right now., I'm going to close this based on Ray's analysis. Junping, if you disagree, please re-open the JIRA., Sorry missing comments on this JIRA. I think Ray's comments make sense and I just missed the discussion on MAPREDUCE-6704. +1 on resolve this issue.]
