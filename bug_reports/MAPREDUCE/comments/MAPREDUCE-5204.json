[The changes look good to me from MR point of view. Can't do much as MR only exposes IOException.

Will commit it together with YARN-629 when that is ready.., Minor conflict on branch-2, this works on that branch. Compiled and ran TestNodeManagerShutDown which was conflicting., Committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Xuan!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3712 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3712/])
    YARN-629. Make YarnRemoteException not be rooted at IOException. Contributed by Xuan Gong.
MAPREDUCE-5204. Handling YarnRemoteException separately from IOException in MR app after YARN-629. Contributed by Xuan Gong. (Revision 1479680)

     Result = SUCCESS
