, Changed monitorAndPrintJob to print one additional report after the job completes., Sid, there is a spelling mistake in reportedafterCompletion., Thanks for taking a look Mahadev. Fixed the spelling mistake.
The patch does require MR2800 as well (otherwise Map progress will stay stuck at 66%), Sid, Is this the right fix? I thought the output lines "completed successfully" in monitorAndPrintJob needs to be changed? no? , Disregard my last comment, was a little confused. Ill attach a testcase with the patch., Updated patch with a added a test case. The test case fails without the patch and passes with the patch., Also, Sid please make sure you grant the apache licence in your attachments! Its very important! , Same as 2737_1, grant license selected., Patch with necessary changes with the new dir layout., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
