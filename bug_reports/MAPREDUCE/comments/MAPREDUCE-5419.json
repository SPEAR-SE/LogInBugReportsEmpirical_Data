org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestNonExistentJob MAPREDUCE-5421, Patch looks good to me. +1. Thanks Rob!, +1, looks good to me as well.  I'll commit this shortly.

Note that initially I could not reproduce this problem, but it is very reproducible by cleaning and only running the TestSlive#testDataWriting test.  It's easier to reproduce with JDK7 when running all of the TestSlive tests since that does not run the unit tests in a deterministic order., Thanks, Rob!  I committed this to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.1-beta, and branch-0.23.]
