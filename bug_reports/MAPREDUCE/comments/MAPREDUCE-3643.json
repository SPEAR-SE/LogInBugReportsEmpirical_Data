[What version is this filed against?  Can you update the affects version field?, I am using the hadoop version 0.20,i couldn't find the exact version in the field., Is there any more information you can give on this?  How reproducible is it?  It sounds like it is kind of sporadic.  So the reducer is the identity reducer, what about the mapper.  Do you any logs that you can upload.  The JT log for the time of the error would be very helpful., Is it stuck in pending for a very long period of time?  Have you checked the queue that you submitted to, to see if it is full or not?, I have attached the snapshot for the job tracker and below i mentioned the console output.

12/01/09 11:36:29 INFO streaming.StreamJob:  map 0%  reduce 0%
12/01/09 11:36:34 INFO streaming.StreamJob:  map 100%  reduce 0%

Streaming command for step4

hadoop fs -rmr $OUTPUT
hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-*.jar \
  -D mapred.job.name="$NAME" \
  -D mapred.reduce.tasks=1 \
  -D mapred.task.timeout=$TIMEOUT \
  -input $INPUT1 \
  -input $INPUT2 \
  -mapper "/bin/awk 'gsub(/\t/, \",\")'" \
  -reducer "/bin/cat" \
  -output $OUTPUT


i have used the /bin/cat instead of identity reducer and mapper
, This is unrelated, but for your information having {code}-reducer NONE{code} or not including a -reducer command is going to be faster then using {code}-reducer /bin/cat{code} as the streaming code will not bother to stream the data through cat which will reduce the IO and processing needed. ]
