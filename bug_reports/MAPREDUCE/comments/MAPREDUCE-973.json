[If you haven't done this already, I'm happy to move it to test.  Should SleepJob move too?, bq. If you haven't done this already, I'm happy to move it to test. Should SleepJob move too?

SleepJob was added in 2007 so we'd have to deprecate, etc. to do that. Since FailJob was added in 0.21, it's easy to move.

Attached a trivial move to src/test, Go ahead and just move sleep job too. I can't see any one minding. The examples are certainly public evolving, anyways., Soright. Moved SleepJob to src/test, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
