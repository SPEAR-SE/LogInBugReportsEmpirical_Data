[Amar, I don't find this key or the newly mapped key - mapreduce.job.userhistorylocation - used anywhere in code in trunk. Therefore, I think this bug does not exist for trunk at least ? But we might need fixes for earlier versions., "Disabling job history if anything fails" is not present in branch 0.21 or trunk. It is removed in job history refactoring through MAPREDUCE-157. Even the configuration mapreduce.jobtracker.jobhistory.completed.location is removed in the same jira.
So, the bug is present in 0.20.* and earlier versions., like it has been pointed out, this has been fixed in trunk and addressed in an internal version via mapreduce-1699 this is no longer a blocker?
(optionally we can port to 1699 to 20.x)

In addition we can do a simple permission check (see attachment) in trunk?, This comment is a code review.

*This is a minor nit* :  

{noformat}

         throw new IOException("Mkdirs failed to create " + done.toString());
       }
-    }
+  } else { // directory exists. Check permissions
+    checkDirectoryPermissions(doneDirFs, done,
+        "mapreduce.jobtracker.jobhistory.completed.location");
+  }

{noformat}

The last {{checkDirectoryPermissions(...)}} call will cruddy up the indentation.  The patch otherwise looks right.]
