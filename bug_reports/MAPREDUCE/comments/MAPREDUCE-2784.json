[Attaching a patch to fix this issue. Issues fixed are
1. NPE in test cases due to missing thread object in the TestGridmixSummary.
2. FileSystem errors due to '-' as Gridmix input in the TestGridmixSubmission.
3. Interface initialization error in ResourceUsageMatcher.

I am still trying to figure out how to run tests and test this patch with the latest codebase.

I tested this patch before the merge and it worked fine., Testing the fix with the newly merged cod-ebase., Attaching a new patch incorporating Ravi's offline review comments. Could not test the patch as I am facing issues with compiling/testing the trunk (after the merge)., Hadoop source folder names changed. Updating and re-uploading the earlier patch to apply cleanly., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Attaching a new patch that has improved test case and fixing a minor nit. test-patch on the local box shows system tests failure and release audit warning. Both of them are not related to this patch., All the gridmix junit tests passed except TestUserResolve. I have filed MAPREDUCE-2950 for the same., Patch looks good to me.
+1, I just committed this. Thanks Ravi for the review and Vinod for helping with YARN blockers., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #925 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/925/])
