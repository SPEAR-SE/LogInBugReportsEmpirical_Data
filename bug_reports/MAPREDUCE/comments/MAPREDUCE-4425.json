[This is similar to the KILL_WAIT hang reported in MAPREDUCE-4751 because it's caused by incorrect bookkeeping in TaskImpl.  Since it ignores attempts completing after the task succeeds, it incorrectly thinks it has uncompleted attempts running after a fetch failure and therefore doesn't launch a new attempt.

Patch to fix the bookkeeping for attempts that complete while we're in the SUCCEEDED state so subsequent fetch failures will cause a new attempt to be launched., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks fine to me. When a task fails or is killed retroactively we remove it from inProgess and add it to finished.  Also when a task succeeds after already succeeding we add it to finished and remove it from inProgess.

I'll check it in., I put this into trunk, and branch-2, but it does not appear to be a clean merge to 0.23.  Could you provide another patch for that?, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3001 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3001/])

, Thanks for looking at this, Bobby.  Here's a patch for branch-0.23.  The RetroactiveKilledAtSucceeded transition is missing in 0.23, so I preserved the existing 0.23 behavior if an attempt that already succeeded was killed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
