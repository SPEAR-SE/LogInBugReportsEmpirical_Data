build.xml:374: taskdef class org.apache.avro.specific.ProtocolTask cannot be found, This fixes the issues with the build also includes the avro upgrade in MAPREDUCE-2848. Am uploading a single patch then both are related., +1 lgtm, Just pushed this. Thanks to Arun and Giri for helping me with this!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #845 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/845/])
