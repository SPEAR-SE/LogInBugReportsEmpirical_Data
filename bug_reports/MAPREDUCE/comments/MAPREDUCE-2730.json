[Looks like there are actually more issues with failed transition. For instance RM Applications Tracking UI column not updated if app Failed. The failed transition basically does nothing right now.  I think it would do something very similar to done or killed but need to investigate more.

The sequence here is from LAUNCHED -> EXPIRED_PENDING - got event FAILED_MAX_RETRIES -> FAILED

, No longer applies with changes made to RM.]
