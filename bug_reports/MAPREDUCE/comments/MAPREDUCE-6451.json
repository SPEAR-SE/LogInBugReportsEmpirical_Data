This message was automatically generated., [~kshukla], Thanks for providing this fix! It looks good in general, but I have a few suggestions.

For the checkstyle warnings, please document the ones you will not be fixing and the reason why. None of them are much of a problem, but I personally would like to see the following fixes (both are in {{DynamicInputFormat.java}}):
- Please put the left parenthesis on the previous line
{code}
+  public  DynamicInputChunkContext<K, V> getChunkContext
+      (Configuration configuration) throws IOException{
{code}
- I know it's just whitespace, but it does look a little awkward, so if you could, please change the indentation:
{code}
+            DistCpUtils.getFileSize(chunkFilePath,
+            chunkContext.getConfiguration()), null), taskAttemptContext);
   }
{code}

In {{TestDynamicInputFormat.java}}:
- I like the assertions to include a string with an error message that is provided when the assertion fails. I recognize that the other assertions in this file don't use that format, but I think it helps when running the tests. So, for example, something like this:
{code}
+    Assert.assertTrue("Contexts from different DynamicInputChunkContext objects should be different.", !firstContext.equals(thirdContext));
{code}
- I didn't find any unit tests for the original functionality that got moved from {{DynamicInputChunk}} to {{DynamicInputChunkContext}}. If they don't exist, can you please open a separate JIRA to cover that?
, Thank you [~eepayne] for your review comments. Updated the patch. For the checkstyle issue of missing package-info.java , the file was not there for mapred/lib directory before and therefore I did not add one now. There is one for tools package already. I was referring the wrong .class  for the new file, corrected that now. Request for review., \\

This message was automatically generated., The release audit warning : 
{noformat}
 !????? /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/CHANGES-HDFS-EC-7285.txt
Lines that start with ????? in the release audit  report indicate files that do not have an Apache license header.
{noformat}
seems unrelated. 

Removed the whitespace issue. Rest are the same as before., \\

Thanks [~kshukla] for reworking the patch.

The Release Audit warning seems to be quite unrelated. Also, as you pointed out, the checkstyle warnings are not things that you have control over.
, Thank you [~eepayne]. Opened [MAPREDUCE-6500|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-6500] for tracking missing test cases for DynamicInputChunk and DynamicRecordReader classes., +1. Thanks for fixing this, [~kshukla]. Apologies for the delayed review., +1, I've committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7. Thanks for working on the fix, Kuhu. Thank you gentlemen for the reviews., Hi [~kihwal], did you forget the {{DynamicInputChunkContext}} class when you commit?
