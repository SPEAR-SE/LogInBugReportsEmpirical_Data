[Tom, Tucu - any ideas?, This has been a problem often for me, even with 0.20 branches sometimes. Think its just eclipse stripping away the {{/}} prefix from the build location? The {{Users}} name of course comes from a Mac, same with {{home}} appearing on *nix., I'm don't know about this particular dir creation, what I've found out in some situations is that often testcases create test file in the current directory. In streaming I've quickly-dirty fixed those testcases by adding 'target/' to those paths.

I've seen this problem since always when using an IDE (which different than Maven the running directory is from where you started the IDE).

IMO the right way of fixing this would be to have a Test Helper class that gives you a local base dir for a testcase and a HDFS base dir for a testcase (for every testcase it should be a different dir). Then we should retrofit all testcases to use this helper class]
