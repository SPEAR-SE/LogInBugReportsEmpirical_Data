One minor thing, it might be good to add a "TODO" in the code comments as a reminder that the root cause is still under investigation., Added TODO., bq. One minor thing, it might be good to add a "TODO" in the code comments as a reminder that the root cause is still under investigation.
The goal of this test is not delete a file that is in use. So TODO seems unnecessary.

[~arpitagarwal] Also windows related comments seems inappropriate. Can a separate jira be created, related to this, to track deletion of file that is in use? I think there might already be some jiras tracking this for Windows., [~sureshms] Removed the Windows-specific comment.

HADOOP-9176 was filed to address the root cause.

Thanks!
