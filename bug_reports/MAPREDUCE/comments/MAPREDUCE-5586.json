[Tests assume a zero sized minimum block size. When run from the top level dir it picks that setting up correctly. When run from the hadoop-tools/hadoop-distcp directory, it is unable to find that setting and therefore uses the default, breaking the test assumptions., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Jon!
Great catch! Thanks for this.
You've inadvertently left a few log messages in the patch. Could you please remove them? 
Also, could we just add the config parameters in getConfigurationForCluster()? Adding an hdfs-site into the resource directory would affect all other tests in that directory.
