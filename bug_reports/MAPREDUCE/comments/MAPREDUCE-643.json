[Do you see the issue consistently (each time you run a job) ?

Most probably, issue is not related to -pugp option.

This issue looks like because of hdfs issue  HADOOP-4681., Running {{distcp -pugp}} always failed; without the option, it succeeded immediately. Looking through the code, I think what is really necessary is just better error handling. {{-pg}} will preserve group membership for files; this has the effect of copying the file to the local filesystem (via the {{file:///}} URI) and then attempting to {{chgrp supergroup}} the file. Of course, there is no "supergroup" locally, so this fails and throws an IOException. That in turn causes a finally-block to delete  {{_distcp_src_files}} and everything else crashes down from there. (Moreover, as Hadoop isn't running as root, the {{chown}} would have failed even if the destination group/user did exist.) 

These actions should fail as that's what the security model dictates. So this ticket is really just documenting a need for clearer documentation of what's going wrong, so it's obvious to not attempt {{-pug}} in the future.

Good observation!  Edited title reflecting this., Closing this as stale given distcpv2!]
