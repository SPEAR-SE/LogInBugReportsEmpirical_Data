     [exec] , The solution implemented is to have it start a new thread to do the actual localization and task launching for that particular task, that way it doesn't block other tasks behind it if the localization of one task is taking a long time. , patch for trunk, Hey Tom, simply changing the JIRA status to be PA -> Open -> PA won't retrigger Hudson. You either need to upload another attachment (could be the same contents) or get someone with Hudson access to retrigger the build for you. I just did the latter. You can watch the build here: https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/489/, Hey Aaron, thanks for the info and kicking the build., +1, Committed the patch in branch-0.20-security. Thomas, there are a bunch of test failures in the build for trunk. Can you please confirm these are harmless., when I first submitted the patch the tests on trunk were already broken. For instance see https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/472/ which is for a different jira.  Let me rerun now just to double check and I'll update you on results., reconfirmed those failures aren't from this patch.  All tests that failed in the hudson build (https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/489) either passed when I run them or also failed on trunk without this patch. 

Thanks for the review/commit!, Committed this to trunk. Thanks, Thomas., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #760 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/760/])
