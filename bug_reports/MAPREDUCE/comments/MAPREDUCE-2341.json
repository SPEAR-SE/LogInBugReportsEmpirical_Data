[In the code segment(void org.apache.hadoop.mapred.Child.main(String[] args) throws Throwable), this case has been handled as shown below

 {code:title=Child.java|borderStyle=solid}
   while(true) {
    ...................................................
    numTasksToExecute = job.getNumTasksToExecutePerJvm();
    assert(numTasksToExecute != 0);
    ...................................................
   }
 {code} 



  As assertions have not been enabled during runtime, the assertion statement here failed to assert and loop goes infinete.
  So I feel, we need to enable assertions while running HDFS/Mapreduce programs.]
