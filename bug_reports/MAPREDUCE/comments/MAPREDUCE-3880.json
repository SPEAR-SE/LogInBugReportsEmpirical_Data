[This hardcoding should suffice for 23.1 since it's ok to have the LCE be 32-bit since we don't need much memory for it and should work on all platforms.

We can make a better fix for 23.2. , lgtm. +1, Thanks Hitesh. Since it's a trivial and harmless change to the build, I'll commit., I just committed this to block 23.1-rc2., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1825 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1825/])

Being fixed as part of MAPREDUCE-3922., Point taken Allen, my bad. Thankfully, it's fixed via MAPREDUCE-3922.]
