[Enforce binary target to depends on compile.c++., Shouldn't the binary target build all the c++ targets, including task-contoller and librecordio? IIUC this will just build pipes, utils and examples., librecordio requires xerces.  For librecordio to compile, path to xerces must be defined in build.properties.  I am trying to make "ant binary" as new comer proof as possible as suggested by Amar Kamat in MAPREDUCE-2521.  Hence, task-controller and librecordio are not included to lower the barrier of entry.  It would be easy to include librecordio and task-controller, if more people comments on this jira that is the right thing to do., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Option #1, ant binary must provide -D for a proper build, or the build fails with this message:

{noformat}
check-xercescroot:

BUILD FAILED
/home/eyang/sandbox/hadoop/git/hadoop-mapreduce/build.xml:1826: 'xercescroot' is not defined.  Please pass -Dxercescroot=<base of xerces 2.8.0 installation> to Ant on the command-line.
{noformat}, Sorry, incompleted statement in -D in previous message.  Usage:

{noformat}
ant clean binary -Dxercescroot=/path/to/xercescroot
{noformat}, Option #2, "ant binary" compiles pipes, and task-controller and utils.  librecordio is not completed unless -Dlibrecordio and -Dxercescroot is defined.

At this point, it's a pick and choose., I prefer to keep it as it was before -- if you don't specify -Dcompile.c++=1 and -Dcompile.native=1, it didn't compile any native code, right?

Strongly against the option that requires xerces, since librecordio is used only by a very tiny subset of users, and is as far as I know deprecated for quite some time., In HDFS-2022, HDFS community decided to change binary target to depends on libhdfs.  Hence, it may be good to be consistent that binary target compiles c++ and native code.  However, here is another patch that will avoid compile of any c++ code for binary target unless specified -Dcompile.* flags.  Just in case., Agree that we should not automatically compile librecordio since it does not build out of the box (we don't bundle it's dependency).  I'm fine if MR wants to keep the compilation contigent on compile.c++ being passed (note that compile.native is just in common), though given that ant binary is supposed to produce a binary tarball it seems like it should build all the binaries. Is the concern that there should be a target that produces a tarball w/ just java code? Newcomers can always use ant jar to build just the java code (assuming they don't need a tarball). , For doing a full release binary tarball, "ant binary" is still not sufficient, since it makes a platform-specific tarball -- the native code is only compiled for the architecture on which you're running, unless you pass some CXXFLAGS and CFLAGS environments.

Plus, "ant binary" is useful for people who want to distribute a tarball around their cluster - it's the full "dist dir" minus the native stuff which some folks may not require., For secure version of hadoop, task-controller is essential.  Secure hadoop should be the default for future version of hadoop, hence, I would vote for MAPREDUCE-2559-2.patch instead of MAPREDUCE-2559-3.patch., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I filed HDFS-2040 to make HDFS more consistent with Common and MR (where ant binary only builds native code if passed a flag). See that jira for rationale.

Eric, Todd - does this patch and the one on HDFS-2040 look reasonable to you guys?, +1 on this patch, but HDFS-2040 patch may have problem., +1 here., I've committed this.
