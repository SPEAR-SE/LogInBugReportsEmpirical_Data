I reviewed it and suggest a little more modification:

Original 
{quote}
-update` | Overwrite if src size different from dst size | As noted in the preceding, this is not a "sync" operation. The only criterion examined is the source and destination file sizes; if they differ, the source file replaces the destination file. As discussed in the Usage documentation, it also changes the semantics for generating destination paths, so users should use this carefully.

Current patched version

This message is automatically generated., Hi [~ajisakaa], thanks for following up, I found your latest version is not quite what I suggested in last comment:

-  or have different contents. `-overwrite` overwrites target-files even if they

+  exist at the target.
 {quote}

Basically two places to change in your patch version 3 (you can refer to my last comment):
1. change "or have different contents"  to "or differ than the target version", this two are different in that when the contents of the two files may be the same, but -update will still update because of blocksize difference for example.
2. change "target-files that they exist" to "target-files that exist"

Thanks.
