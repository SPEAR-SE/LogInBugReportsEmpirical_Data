[Straight-forward fix., Arun, this patch has gone stale. Could you regenerate it please?, Clearly, the function get_values needs improvement for handling invalid inputs. But it doesn't warrant a blocker status ? Typical usages of this code come from configuration files that are hard to get wrong.

I would definitely love to improve get_values, but there should be no pressure to fix this as a blocker, IMO. Thoughts ?, I agree, removing 'blocker' status., task controller has been replaced. Closing as stale.]
