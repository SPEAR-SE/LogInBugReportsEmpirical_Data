[I also ran into similar issue earlier. the reason for this error is that - you are generating 20m of input. Gridmix code, when runs traces, looks for input data files that have more than 128mb in size. So if  you generate 20m of data, file filter search does not find any input > 128mb of size. Hence, the error. 

THe fix is to add a config parameter to the gridmix command - "-Dgridmix.min.file.size= <MIN_SIZE>". Hope this helps. , Dear Sir or Madam,

Have you solve this error in Gridmix?

Thank you for your help.

Regards,

Rui
