[I think it does break other InputFormat implementations.  For example, FileInputFormat returns number of splits as 1 for an empty input file and the method getLocations() in FileSplit returns a 0 length array.  This can cause array index out of bound exception if one is not careful enough to check the array length.

There is also another potential problem.  When an MR job is run with an empty input, if the number of splits is 0, the number of mappers will be 0 and number of reducers can be non-zero.  I am not sure whether the MR job will run successfully.  My preference is to have all InputFormat implementations return 1 split of size 0 when the input is empty.

On a side note, when this test failed, the assertion message
{code}
testForEmptyFile(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.TestCombineFileInputFormat): expected:<0> but was:<1>
{code}
was confusing.  It should be:
{code}
testForEmptyFile(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.TestCombineFileInputFormat): expected:<1> but was:<0>
{code}

Upon examining the test, there are several places where the parameter order is wrong to assertEquals().  I raised MAPREDUCE-4479 and posted a patch there., I think we should fix this on the InputFormat side, if we expect an empty job to have 1 empty split. I think the underlying fix in Common is indeed an improvement., Todd,
   In the meantime, do you have any suggestion on how I can get a clean trunk build?  Also, after this is fixed, can you please commit MAPREDUCE-4479 to the trunk?
Thanks.

This message is automatically generated., I think a proper fix should address all InputFormat implementations.  Tests for empty input should be added for all input formats.  For example, I added a test in TestFileInputFormat.java to test for empty input.  It is also failing.

, Mariappan,
Thank you for a test. Could you please clarify what is the correct way to obtain split locations in InputFormat?, Hi Ilya Katsov,
  Sorry, I was not able to get back ASAP since Jira was down.  I looked at the code for FileInputFormat.  I am sorry, I misled you.  The method getLocations() in InputSplit CAN return a 0 length array for an empty file since there is no physical block of storage associated with the file.  I have attached the new version of TestFileInputFormat.java.  I feel that it is good to have a test for an empty file since it tests a boundary condition.

Cheers,

I've added this test to the patch. As far as I see, getSplits depends directly on FileSystem.getFileBlockLocations only in FileInputFormat and CombinedFileInputFormat, so other InputFormat implementations should be OK.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Ilya Katsov,
  You are right.  Your patch should fix the affected test.  However, I think NLineInputFormat, DBInputFormat, and CompositeInputFormat implementations may fail on empty input for different reasons.  There is no test for empty input for them:( I think this can be addressed in a different Jira.

By the way, is there a committer who is going to commit your patch?

Thanks.

No. , +1, the latest patch looks good to me. I have also locally applied the patch and I am no longer seeing the failure. Thanks!, With and without the patch I see the following failure:

, Seems the new changes pushed by HDFS-3672 exposed more errors. I see that the test was succeeding before this commit and failing afterwards., I've just committed the fix for the ArrayStoreException in TestCombineFileInputFormat as described in MAPREDUCE-4577.
