[Josh, sorry, took me a while to get to this.

Thanks for the patch.

Could we just add a check to FifoScheduler.reinit ala CS.reinit? That way we can keep a single method in Scheduler. I'm happy to rename it 'configure' or some such. Thoughts?, No worries Arun- it was a hectic week. Really enjoyed your talk at the Summit, lots of good questions from the audience.

My preference for the two separate methods was based on the idea that the containerTokenSecretManager and clusterTracker really should never change once the scheduler is init'd, and that having the two separate methods would prevent any other scheduler impls that came along from introducing the same kind of error. If that isn't true, i.e., there is some situation where we would want to change the value of the containerTokenSecretManager/clusterTracker, I'm fine to have the single reinit method., Modified patch to include new tests., Simpler patch that just updates the impl of FifoScheduler to make it differentiate between initialization and re-initialization, ala the CapacityScheduler., -1 overall.
