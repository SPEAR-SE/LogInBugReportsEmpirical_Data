[Uploading a starter patch, This patch moves historyserver start/stop to bin/mapred from bin/yarn. I have added support scripts bin/start-mapred.sh bin/stop-mapred.sh and bin/mapred-daemon.sh as supporting scripts. All three support scripts are based completely on their yarn counter parts. I have opted at this point not to create corresponding MAPRED_ environment under the assumption that mapreduce always depends on yarn. I have verified that controlling history server from start-mapred.sh, stop-mapred.sh, mapred-daemon.sh, and mapred all work as expected., -1 overall.

minor comments from the patch. 

{noformat}usage="Usage: mapreduce-daemon.sh [--config <conf-dir>] [--hosts hostlistfile] (start|stop) <yarn-command> "{noformat}

I *think*, instead of mapreduce-daemon.sh, it should be mapred-daemon.sh in mapred-daemon.sh. Moreover after inclusion of this patch, it will be  nomore a yarn-command, it will be a mapred-command.

{noformat}$ $YARN_HOME/bin/mapred stop historyserver --config $HADOOP_CONF_DIR {noformat}
I *think*, we should replace HADOOP_CONF_DIR by YARN_CONF_DIR and mapred by mapred-daemon.sh in ClusterSetup.apt.vm., Thanks for the comments. I have fixed the issues you have addressed. I have left historyserver being started by mapred since i think that better reflects the recommended usage., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
