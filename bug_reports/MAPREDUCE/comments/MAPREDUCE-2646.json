[Vinod and I discussed this. It seems like in the returned container list from RM, priority at which the respective
container got allocated is needed. Without which AM cant update the ask/release data structures correctly leading to
resource table in AM and RM going out of sync., Added priority in the allocated container object. AM now assigns the container based on the allocated container priority., Rebased Sharad's patch on HEAD..., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12496437/MAPREDUCE-2646.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 9 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good. +1., We need to write a test for this, but the central test for this, TestRMContainerAllocator is disabled for now. I'll add a test for this as part of MAPREDUCE-3089., I just committed this trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Sharad and Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #955 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/955/])
