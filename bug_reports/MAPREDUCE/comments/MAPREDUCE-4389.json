[Output formats always look at OutputK/V classes. The intermediate output writer always looks at MapOutputK/V classes, which is checked only if numReduces > 0. Hence, for all final outputs, be it in map stage or be it in reduce stage, its only the former that matters to the O/F.

I'm for closing this JIRA as invalid, unless you feel a doc improvement at least needs to be made.]
