[I have just ran this on trunk and don't see the issue., Still I could see the issue even with  very clean build., FWIW, {{ant binary-system}} fails like this for me with the latest trunk (rev. 1022856):

{quote}, Yes, I can see the issue with 'missing' jar file too. The patch addresses the problem. Thanks for catching it, Vinay. Please confirm that it works for you too., Patch works for me.
+1., Awesome, I'll commit it in the morning after usual validation., Ranjit, your problem seems to caused by some outdated artifacts left either in ivy cache or in your local m2 repository. I have ran trunk build on a pristine machine (where I have built MR before) and your issue doesn't seem to exist.

If you keep seeing it - please feel free to open a new JIRA., Yeah, so much for ivy/maven easing the build process. :-(

I nuked "~/.ivy2", applied your patch and re-built using "ant binary-system" and this time it works.
Thanks a lot.

+1 for your patch., I have ran test-patch locally:
