[Setting proper access-control was originally aimed as part of HADOOP-4491, but moved out as HADOOP-4491 involved a huge patch. Task logs will still have 777(world read-write-executable) permissions after HADOOP-4491. This has to be fixed, in the minimum the world writable part of it., Attaching an initial patch which fixes the permissions of the task log file.

The approach taken by the patch is as follows:

* When a JVM exits, we finialize the logs of the tasks which were associated with the task. We set the log files to have 700 permission and the files/folders are owned by task tracker.

Patch has to be applied over the patch attached in the JIRA HADOOP-4491, Attaching a new patch, incorporating Vinod's and Hemanths offline comment:

* Task log attempt directories now have 755 permission while JVM is executing tasks, which are owned by the user.
* After task executions are done, all the attempt directories are changed to 700 and owned by TaskTracker., The latest approach slated at HADOOP-4491 invalidates this JIRA issue. Task-logs are set secure permissions of 2770 user:mapred as part of HADOOP-4491 itself. Closing this issue as a duplicate.]
