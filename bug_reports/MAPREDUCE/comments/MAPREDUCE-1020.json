[Here are some of the pending tests that come to my mind:
 - verify that support for priorities cannot be changed from enabled to disabled and vice versa during refresh
 - verify the consistency in state of JobQueuesManager
    -- what happens to the 'jobQueues' list? (Not sure, myself)
    -- the actual lits of running and waiting jobs
 - JobInitializationPoller
  -- per-queue maxUsersAllowedToInitialize
  -- per-queue maxJobsPerUserToInitialize
  -- running-state of the poller
    -- jobs with the poller
    -- how changed ulimits affect the after-refresh behaviour of the poller
 - verify the running-state of the scheduler
    -- numJobsByUser
    -- numWaitingJobs
    -- maxCapacityPercent
    -- queue-scheduling-context objects
    -- map/reduce task-scheduling information
      -- cluster-capacity
      -- numRunningTasks
      -- numSlotsOccupied
      -- maxCapacity
      -- numSlotsOccupiedByUser, Uploading with the above test cases being implemented.
In addition, methods are introduced in JobInitializationPoller in order to access private inner class QueueInfo.maxUsersAllowedToInitialize and QueueInfo.maxJobsPerUserToInitialize.]
