[As we know, xattrs can be stored in 4 namespaces: user, trusted, security and system.

{{user}} and {{trusted}} namespaces xattr are available to user, but {{security}} and {{system}} namespaces xattr are only for HDFS core.  
Initial thought is distcp supports preserving {{user}} and {{trusted}} namespaces xattr; for {{security}} and {{system}} namespaces, they should be managed by target FS through pre-configuration. 
For example, in HDFS transparent encryption, {{security}} namespace xattrs are used. To copy encryption dir from src HDFS to target HDFS, user needs to create the encryption zone in target HDFS firstly, then data written to the encryption dir of target HDFS will be encrypted automatically. 

Agree with [~andrew.wang] to use new option flag "-px" of distcp for "preserve XAttrs"., The patch is for distcp support to preserve {{user}} and {{trusted}} namespaces xattrs using option flag "-px"., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I have few comments below.

DistCpUtils.java:
  file system rooot. ---> file system root.

 {code}
  try {
      fs.getXAttrs(new Path(Path.SEPARATOR));
    } catch (Exception e) {
      throw new XAttrsNotSupportedException("XAttrs not supported for file system: "
        + fs.getUri());
    }
  {code}
  seems like we are generically handling Exception and saying xattrs not supported in fs. But the api call can fail due to many other reasons like permission issues. Does it possible to bring down to handle specific exception?ex: no such method etc.

  {code}
  new Option("p", true, "preserve status (rbugpca)(replication, " +
  {code}
  we need to change from rbugpca -> rbugpcax?, Thanks Uma for your detailed review.

Right, I will update it.

Actually we getXAttrs on *root dir*, and the failure could be one of following reasons:
  1. File system is HDFS < 2.4, so getXAttrs RPC endpoint doesn't exist
  2. File system is HDFS >= 2.4, but XAttrs are not enabled.
  3. FileSystem subclass doesn't override the XAttr APIs, and throw {{UnsupportedOperationException}}.

All the above failues indicates XAttrs not supported.
Furthermore, it's a bit difficult to handle specific exception, since they all are IOException subtype, and different FileSystem implementation may throw different IOException subtype.

, I filed MAPREDUCE-5922 as a follow-up to update the distcp documentation to mention the new option for preserving xattrs., Thanks Chris for filing it. I actually filed that jira already MAPREDUCE-5920. So, I will mark MAPREDUCE-5922 as dupe of this. Will take care of merging this along with disctcp issue after HDFS-2006 merge to branch-2., I have merged this to branch-2 as well., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5707 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5707/])
