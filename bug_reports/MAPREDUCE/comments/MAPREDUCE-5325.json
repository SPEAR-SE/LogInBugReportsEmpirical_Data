[MR changes, @Xuan, will mapreduce jobs have different application types or only a single fixed type for all MR jobs? If the latter, the getAllJobs() should not be taking application type as an argument., @Hitesh, you are right. We do not need MR api changes in this case., Overall patch being reviewed as part of YARN-727. Will be committed together to ensure build does not break., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4056 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4056/])
    YARN-727, MAPREDUCE-5325. ClientRMProtocol.getAllApplications should accept ApplicationType as a parameter. Contributed by Xuan Gong. (Revision 1501599)

     Result = SUCCESS
