This message is automatically generated., TestRMContainerAllocator fails due to MAPREDUCE-5427, lgtm. +1 (non binding), Could you elaborate on how the configuration is leaking between tests?  The test cases all construct a new Configuration object and call setConf with it, so I'm not seeing how the configuration setting from one test is leaking into another.  Seems more likely the properties being explicitly set by the patch were being accidentally picked up from a mapred-site.xml file in some environments which would break the test.  Just want to make sure I understand the nature of the fix.

Minor nit in the patch: the order of the last two arguments in the following code should be flipped since the Assert.assertEquals calling convention is {{expected, actual}} instead of {{actual, expected}}:

{code}
    Assert.assertEquals("Only 1 try was expected but was : "
      + this.notificationCount, this.notificationCount, 1);
{code}, Good thought, Jason. After further investigation, the failing test is using a Configuration object. If it runs first, it passes since none of the {mapred,yarn}-{default,site}.xml and assumes the source code default retry interval of 5 seconds. If it runs after any of the test that run a job, it fails since the first use of JobConf will add the default and site files to the default resources of the configuration class. The assumption of falling back to the source code default of 5 seconds is no longer valid, since it is picking of the mapred-default.xml value of 1 second.

I will change this test class to use the jobconf object to avoid any test order dependencies and add the config settings explicit to avoid changes to the default.xml causing the test to fail again., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
