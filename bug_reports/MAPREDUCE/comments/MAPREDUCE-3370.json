This message is automatically generated., Can you also take care of MAPREDUCE-3338 as part of this? We need to make sure no test depends on MiniMRYarnCluster.HADOOP_MAPREDUCE_CLIENT_APP_JAR_NAME because of the hard-coded version. If you agree, please also fix TestDistributedShell to not use hard-coded version.

Also, how do you plan to set the sytem property? Need some changes to pom.xml files too?, Ahmed, Instead using a System property, why don't you do JAR discovery by class?

JobConf has a findContainingJar() method that if you make it public would do this for you:

The the code would be:

{{code}}
public class MiniMRYarnCluster extends MiniYARNCluster {

  public static final String APPJAR =JobConf.findContainingJar(LocalContainerLauncher.class);;
  ...

}
{{code}}

, Thanks Vinod, I'll take a look. I have assigned MAPREDUCE-3338 to myself.

Thanks Tucu, I agree, this is a nicer way. The problem is findContainingJar(..) is not visible. We can change it to public if no one objects, not sure why it is not. I'll update the patch. , Updated patch using JobConf.findContainingJar(..) instead of system property. This will also eliminate the need of modifying pom to set the property., -1 overall.

I closed MAPREDUCE-3338 as duplicate. Can you please fix TestDistributedShell also? Thanks!, Thanks!

Attaching an updated patch that also addresses the TestDistributedShell.

The JobConf.findContainingJar() doesn't work for the TestDistributedShell case because the test class is part of the app jar. Generally the ability to use JobConf.findContainigJar() will depend on how  maven works, when jars are created, and if tests are in separate modules. 

For this reason, I have updated the patch to first check for system properties, and if not set, find the containing jar. So no need to modify the test if we decided later to move tests into separate modules and not  using the system properties., bq. +            <yarn.ds.jar>../hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell/target/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell-0.24.0-SNAPSHOT.jar</yarn.ds.jar>
  Would it be better to use ${version} instead of the hardcoded version in the pom file?

This message is automatically generated., Ahmed, can you please address Hitesh's comment? Also, the bit about javac warnings., Thanks! Attaching an updated patch using version. The javac warnings are the result of using the deprecated JobConf. I don't think we have another equivalent to JobConf.findContainingJar(..)., bq.
