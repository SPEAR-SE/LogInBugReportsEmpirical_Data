[This patch refactors the StateMachineFactory inner classes code., Thanks for cleaning this up!

My only comment is that I think we can do away with the ApplicableTransition interface entirely, since it is a private, inner interface that just has one implementation. So why not rename ApplicableSingleOrMultipleTransition -> ApplicableTransition, and remove the interface definition entirely?, Thanks for your review Josh! 
It is generally beneficial to have this interface separation, specially if we decided to add other implementations in the future. This was my basic motive for keeping the interface., looks good Ahmed. I think we can probably still keep the interface as long as its not public. Did you already run mvn test? If yes Ill go ahead and push it., Thanks Mahadev! Yes, and all tests ran successfully., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
