[In addition to DelegationTokenSecretManager's state not being restored, there's a problem with delegation token renewal for JT tokens. When jobs are recovered delegation tokens are renewed immediately (see DelegationTokenRenewal.registerDelegationTokensForRenewal), and this happens before the JT RPC server has started, so the renewal will fail and the delegation token will be removed. This will cause the job to fail.]
