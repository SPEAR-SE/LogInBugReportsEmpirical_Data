[This is by design. Before MAPREDUCE-3720, "job -list" used to go to each AM which is a security issue if every user tries to visit every AM. After MAPREDUCE-3720 though, the command doesn't go to each AM, so the security issue is lessened, but still we print stuff like AM URL (after MAPREDUCE-3761) which in itself can be private and should be blacked out.

So for now, I'll allow listing all jobs but with potential private information blacked out., As mentioned in MAPREDUCE-3668, our QE tests use {{mapred job -list}} to check the status of jobs submitted from different users.  We can unblock the tests by opening up the ACL for VIEW_JOB, but we'd like to avoid modifying the cluster configuration in this way during testing., Patch to allow users to see all jobs.  Per Vinod's comment, certain information is excluded from the ApplicationReport if the user does not have VIEW_JOB access.  Without VIEW_JOB access, the application usage report is null and the following report fields are "N/A":

* host
* RPC port
* diagnostics
* tracking URL
* original tracking URL
* client token

This message is automatically generated., So now if you are a user that doesn't have acl permissions to the job, this causees mapred job -status or any other command that goes to app master to hang since its returning host name of N/A.  The clientServiceDelegate getProxy() is expecting the host to be valid.  We need to fix it so it doesn't hang and somehow gives a useful error message to give the user some reason why these are failing., Added client-side code to check for an unavailable AM host for a running job and log an appropriate message, and it handles an unavailable AM host similarly to a network ACL issue for the AM (i.e.: reporting status as if a non-running job)
, +1, the patch looks good.

I'll wait for hudson and commit it after., On second thoughts, the code to deal with 'no access' being spread over the RM and the client (admittedly, only for display) bothers me a little.

How about return a static DUMMY_APPLICATION_RESOURCE_USAGE_REPORT with all fields zeroed out (say set to -1) in case of 'no access' from RM to the client? We should also document this behaviour via javadoc.

Some minor nits:
# Use a constant rather than the string 'N/A'
# Maybe the parameter should be called allowAccess rather than fullAccessAllowed, or maybe I'm being too sensitive! :), +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
