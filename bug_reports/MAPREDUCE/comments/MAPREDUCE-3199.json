This is not related to this, but must have started happening after MAPREDUCE-3003 went in.

With the patch, all tests are passing. I am committing this for unblocking trunk tests., I just committed this to trunk.

Leaving this open for pushing to 0.23. Linking MAPREDUCE-3003 as the blocker., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1185 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1185/])
