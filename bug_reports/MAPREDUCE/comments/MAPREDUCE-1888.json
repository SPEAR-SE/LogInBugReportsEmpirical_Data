[Attaching patch fixing the issue. Added testcase that validates the user set config properties mapreduce.map.output.key.class and mapreduce.output.key.class are honored in streaming jobs with java classes as mapper and reducer., Some comments on the patch:
* Please don't change  genArgs() in TestStreaming. You can override it in TestStreamingJavaTasks as done in other tests.
* Is the Change in TestFileOutputFormat required?, >> Please don't change genArgs() in TestStreaming. You can override it in TestStreamingJavaTasks as done in other tests.

Hmm. That will be duplication of code. I want to avoid that. Modified all other testcases also that are derived from TestStreaming so that reuse of code is done(in my new patch).

>> Is the Change in TestFileOutputFormat required?

This is just a duplication of code of those 2 lines. Though unrelated to this JIRA, removed those 2 lines.

Test failure is because of MAPREDUCE-1834. , I just committed this. Thanks Ravi !, While working on MAPREDUCE-1122, i realized that one more corner case got missed here. For reducer=NONE, if the mapper is a command, then job output key and value types should be set from IO identifier., I just reverted the commit to fix the corner case., Ravi, Can you add testcases for all combination of the following?
1) Mapper is command or is a java mapper.
2) Reducer is command or is java mapper or is None.
You can rename the testcase TestStreamingOutputKeyValueTypes instead of TestStreamingJavaTasks.

A couple of mumak tests failed with NoClassDefFoundError, they passed on my local machine. TestSimulatorDeterministicReplay failed because of MAPREDUCE-1834.
Will check this in., I just committed this.
