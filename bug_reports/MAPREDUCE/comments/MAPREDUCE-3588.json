[Straight-fwd patch, tested on a small, secure cluster., Small patch, +1. Cannot fathom how this could be missed in MAPREDUCE-3366. Going to push this in to unblock deployments., I just committed this to trunk and merged it into branch-0.23. Thanks Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1460 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1460/])

, Not sure if this was needed. I was able to start a cluster yesterday, post MR3366 without much trouble. Will check again later., The same thing happened with me. I was able to start one cluster up but one one other cluster I had this issue. Not sure what the difference was. Will check as well., Adding the MR components to the classpath was moved to hadoop-config.sh. With an upgraded hadoop-common package, this patch shouldn't be required., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit #324 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit/324/])

, bq. Adding the MR components to the classpath was moved to hadoop-config.sh. With an upgraded hadoop-common package, this patch shouldn't be required.

Ok, that seems broken. We should have hadoop-config.sh rely on MR etc., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #901 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/901/])
