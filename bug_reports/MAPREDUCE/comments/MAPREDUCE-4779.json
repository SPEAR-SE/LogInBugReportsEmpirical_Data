This message is automatically generated., Amir, the patch submission and automatic building/testing is only used by patch for trunk. Thus you may want to cancel your patch and run ant test and testpatch locally. Also I tried to apply your patch to branch-1. Seems you need to rebase the patch., Thanks Jing for the education, it was most useful .. , patch for branch-1, branch-1 is now effectively EOL. Closing.]
