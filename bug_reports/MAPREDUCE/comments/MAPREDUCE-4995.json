[See below for output from an "ant package" run.  PATH_MAX undeclared is trivially fixed by adding #include <limits.h>. The missing functions are trickier. In my quick grep of the Mac header files, I didn't find any declarations for those functions.

     [exec] make: *** [impl/task-controller.o] Error 1Actually, I take back my last comment about task-controller. It would still be incompatible in the sense that people running "ant package" may currently expect it to bundle task-controller, and the change I described would require them to start passing the compile.native parameter.
I am +1 for version 6 of the patch after removal of if="compile.native" from the task-controller target. This is enough to get "ant compile" working on Mac. We'd still need a Linux VM to run "ant package".
Does anyone think that perhaps the right thing to do is to get task-controller compiling on Mac? This would be handled in a separate jira. I've pasted the compilation failures below.
