[I looked into this a bit and it has a number of problems.

{{HostUtil.getTaskLogUrl()}} is only called in YARN/MR by the 'mapred job -history' CLI command if you pass an undocumented "all" option to it.  

Even then, it doesn't work properly:
1. My job ran on {{rkanter-5.ent.cloudera.com}} and it printed out {{http://5.ent.cloudera.com:8042/tasklog?attemptid=attempt_1398191410609_0020_m_000001_0}}, which mangled the hostname
2. Even with the correct hostname, that URL returns a 404 error because it's not the correct

I think the equivalent proper URL is actually something in the JHS...
