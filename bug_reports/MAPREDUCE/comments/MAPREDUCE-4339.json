[Srikanth - what do you see in the RM logs?, I'm wondering if this is caused by what you reported in MAPREDUCE-4338.  Are there any nodemanagers successfully running in the cluster at the time the job hangs?  A job submitted to a cluster that has no nodemanagers will hang waiting for nodes to run the job.  You can check the RM web UI to see if there are any nodes registered., This example i ran in on a single node where all the daemons are running on the same node successfully. I tried to use the capacity scheduler. then the job is getting hanged., I am unable to reproduce a hang like this on a single-node cluster.  Could you examine the ResourceManager logs for issues or post them (after any necessary scrubbing/anonymization)? That would help track down what's going on when the job hangs., Hi [~srikraj8341] 
Is this still a issue for 2.x? If not, would you mind we close it?, I will close this issue since it can not be regenerated. Open if necessary. ]
