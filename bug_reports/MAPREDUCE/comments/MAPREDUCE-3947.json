No tests needed for this since it is a documentation issue., I think the default AM memory is also under review. Do we really need 2 GB defaults for the AM?

Perhaps you can mark this as dupe of MAPREDUCE-3812 and improve upon Vinod's patch on that, which sorta lowers configs (still a good place to add to xml)?, Harsh, I agree that MAPREDUCE-3812 is a good place to add in the config, but it has been stalled for a while and it is not a big deal for MAPREDUCE-3812 to update the default.xml as well.

I am +1 the change is simple enough and documents the config properly., Thanks Devaraj, I put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2185 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2185/])
