[Nishan, is this 0.23.0 or 0.23.1? 0.23.1 has several fixes for the decommissioned nodes.

Also, I see you opened another ticket MAPREDUCE-3873. Your observation here is with the resolved host names right?, This is with the 0.23.0

All the configurations with the hostname only i have given., Thanks for the confirmation. This is fixed in 0.23.1 via MAPREDUCE-2775.]
