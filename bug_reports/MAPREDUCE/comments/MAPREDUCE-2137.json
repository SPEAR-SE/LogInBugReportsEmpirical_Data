[In gridmix's simulated job's configuration, a property "gridmix.job.name.original" is set to the original job's jobID. But this config property name is misleading. I am proposing that we will have 2 config properties
(1) "gridmix.job.name.original" that contains the original job's jobName and
(2) "gridmix.job.id.original" that contains the original job's jobID

But these properties can't go into the new trace files generated by Rumen and thus comparing trace1 and trace2(of "Description" of this JIRA) is still an issue.

I propose that we change the gridmix simulated jobs' name from 
GRIDMIX<5digitsSequenceNumber>
to
GRIDMIX<6digitsSequenceNumber>_<originalJobID>

This will give us a simple mapping between gridmix's simulated jobs and their corresponding original MR jobs.

Note that the sequenceNumber is also getting changed from 5 digits to 6 digits sothat one gridmix run can have more number of simulated jobs.

Thoughts ?, Attaching patch for trunk with the above mentioned changes.

Testcase changes are not fully testing the main code change of this patch(i.e. gridmix job name change) as the testcases are exercising MockJob instead of ZombieJob., Thanks for doing this. Some comments:
* We'll have to update the documentation accordingly, but perhaps only after MAPREDUCE-1931 is committed.
* I prefer changing "JOBNAMEPREFIX" to "JOBNAME_PREFIX" or even "JOB_NAME_PFX" so that it's more readable. Ditto for "ORIGJOBID" to "ORIG_JOBID" or "ORIG_JOB_ID".
* The {{StringBuilder}} in {{initialValue()}} has an _initial capacity_ of 64, but the comment makes it seem as if we're talking about the _total capacity_. I suggest dropping that comment.
* I know that we're not making the GridMix job-name's format a contract, but do you think it makes sense to check that the job has an expected format in the unit-test? (Since Rumen does not generate traces containing the values corresponding to "gridmix.job.id.original", the job name is the only link back to the original job if you're looking at a Rumen-generated trace.), Attaching an updated patch incorporating review comments. Also made some existing dead code in testcase to get executed because it was pending on MAPREDUCE-118 and that is resolved already., Patch reviewed and looks ok.

This message is automatically generated., Making minor changes...., Attaching new patch. With this patch,

(1) The gridmix simulated job name is of the format GRIDMIX<6-digit-sequence-number>

(2) The configuration properties gridmix.job.original-job-id and gridmix.job.original-job-name in the configuration of simulated job are exposed/documented to gridmix user. These config properties are to be used for mapping a simulated job to its corresponding original job from trace file., The latest patch looks good to me. +1. We can commit this., -1 overall.
