This message is automatically generated., Regarding the QA test result.
It is a simple bug fixe. No new unit test case is required.
However, I did manual test in a small cluster following these steps:
1. Set "mapreduce.task.userlog.limit.kb=5200"  in mapred-site.xml.
2. Restart nodemanger
3. Submit wordcount example.
4. Check MR AM container syslog and found the expected log contents.

, Looks good, +1. Committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Mohammad!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4932 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4932/])

, I recently noticed that AM logs were being truncated, see MAPREDUCE-5730, and it appears to be caused by this change.  The patch is shutting down the LogManager in the finally block of the main thread, but the main method does not wait around for the MRAppMaster to complete.  This means under normal conditions the log system is being shutdown sometime shortly after startup, effectively disabling the AM logs entirely after that point., [~jlowe] : I created another JIRA MapReduce-5723 to address this. There is a patch uploaded. If possible can you please review this? ]
