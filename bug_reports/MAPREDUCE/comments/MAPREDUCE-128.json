[Hello Team,

Please any updates on this...

we have configured magetno solr search on our stage instance.While testing, we noticed that solr is not working as expected.we searched on solr confgiuration and we used "java -jar start.jar" to check the port status. we noticed the above mentioned issue (ie failed with java.net.BindException Address already in use).
Any comment or help will be appriciated.

thanks!]
