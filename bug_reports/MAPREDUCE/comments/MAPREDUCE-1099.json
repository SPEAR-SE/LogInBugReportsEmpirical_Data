[Note that I am not suggesting we speculate setup and cleanup tasks. In an offline discussion with Amareshwari and Devaraj we realized there are potential difficulties in speculating these attempts. Firstly there's no good way to measure the progress of these attempts against other attempts. I am just opening this issue to open for discussion., We have encountered the same problem, so We just remove the setup and cleanup task (inport the patch https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-463 )]
