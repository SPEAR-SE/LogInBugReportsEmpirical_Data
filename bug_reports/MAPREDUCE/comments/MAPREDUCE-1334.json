This message is automatically generated., Going over the patch queue. This patch is still fine and fixes the test. There was one unnecessary import of FileOutputCommitter in the patch which I removed. I shall upload a patch with this change., Removed an unnecessary import., Twice now, Hudson didn't seem to have picked this patch up.
