[Attaching patch which fixes this issue. Transitive dependencies in contrib/vertica and contrib/sqoop were pulling in commons-codec-1.2.jar, so I put explicit dependencies on commons-codec in their ivy.xml files to sync them to commons-codec-1.3.

Note that the original motivation for this issue is that Sqoop depends on commons-io-1.4 but seems to be the only component of Hadoop that does so. Therefore, without this patch, Sqoop will not execute from a binary-only release. After this patch, commons-io-1.4.jar is put in the output "lib" dir correctly., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Moving to open, pending discussion on HADOOP-6370., New patch based on discussion in HADOOP-6370.  All the common deps are copied into contrib/(projname)/lib except for those which are already in the global "lib" directory.

Adds "test" ivy configurations to some contrib projects so that they do not pull in hadoop-hdfs-test and hadoop-core-test in "common" mode.

Removed a few other spurious dependencies (e.g., slf-log4j) from some projects. They should be fine using the global log4j. (Since that's all we were shipping, anyway), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1 This looks good to me. I tried building a tarball with this patch and it successfully created lib subdirectories for index and sqoop, and they contained only the extra dependencies., Forgot to define 'test' ivy configurations in dynamic-scheduler and mrunit, thus the '-1'.
