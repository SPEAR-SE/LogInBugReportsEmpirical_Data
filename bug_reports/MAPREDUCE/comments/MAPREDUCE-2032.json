[I assume we have a convention that tests don't leave junk behind, as opposed to having a convention that tests clean out all possible junk before they start., I found the problem.

{{TestJobCleanup}} leaves behind files that cause {{TestJobOutputCommitter}} to error out.

This patch, which I ripped out of MAPREDUCE-323 , solves this bug.  If it gets committed, I'll strip it from MAPREDUCE-323 ., re-submitting for hudson, Can you delete the TEST_ROOT_DIR in tearDown, instead of deleting output directory in every testcase ?, I'll look into that when me back from vacation., I honored the request made in a previous comment, +1 for the patch.
Test passes now during ant test run. Will commit this., I just committed this. Thanks Dick !, Committed the fix to branch 0.21 as well., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
