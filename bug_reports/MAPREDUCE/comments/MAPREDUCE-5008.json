This message is automatically generated., Is there a way to test this, manual or otherwise?, With the merge turned on in the local job runner (MAPREDUCE-434), TestReporter, which includes progress counting, fails.  With this patch and MAPREDUCE-434, it passes.  Does that sound sufficient to you Tom?, Yes, that is fine. +1 for the patch., I just committed this. Thanks, Sandy., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3389 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3389/])
