[Pradeep, is there an issue with having a common model for handling tasks? In future we might want to keep the output of setup/cleanup tasks staged until the task completes. Do we really need special handling for setup/cleanup?, Taking the cleanup task for discussion - conceptually this task runs at the end of job run and the OutputCommitter implementation does not anticipate setUpTask() , needsTaskCommit(), commitTask() and abortTask() methods  being called at the end of the job run -setupTask() for example might have logic needed to setup the output for writing in a real map or reduce task - calling them may have unwanted side effects like (say) temp directories being created on hdfs for setup. To keep semantics right, it would seem that the cleanup task should only call the cleanupJob() method and setup task should only call setupJob() for the same reasons of not causing unwanted side effects - thoughts?, Fixed by MAPREDUCE-1476]
