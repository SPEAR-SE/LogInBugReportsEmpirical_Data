[Ramgopal, do you have retries enabled? Bump yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-retries to say 3 or 4 and retry with a fresh cluster. The default value is 1, so the retry is off by default., Hi vinod ,
By enabling yarn.resourcemanager.am.max-retries in yarn-site.xml the RM retries specified number of times before failing the job. Thanks
