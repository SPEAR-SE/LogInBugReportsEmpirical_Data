This message is automatically generated., +1 LGTM. With a documentation change like this, there is little to no risk of putting this into 0.23.x. Glad to see you take up this issue. It is customary to request taking over a ticket so as to not step on anyone's toes, however. , Thank you for the remindering, [~jeagles]. I checked [~phatak.dev]'s activities, the latest one was in July 2012. I will ask patch owner and wait for 3 days before taking it in the next time., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5527 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5527/])
