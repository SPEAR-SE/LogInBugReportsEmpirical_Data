[The attached testcase should pass if proxyuser settings work.

Using the MR1 bridge API as I've written/verify the testcase with 0.20.20#., Tucu, after MR-3443, proxy users should work - at least the doAs part.
There's several issues after that

1. MiniMRYarnCluster - set the default app staging dir to the test Working dir. Ran into
testValidProxyUser(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestMiniMRProxyUser): Permission denied: user=u1, access=EXECUTE, inode="/home":<REPLACED_USER>:supergroup:drwxr-x---

getJobConf needs -> conf.set(MRJobConfig.MR_AM_STAGING_DIR, "/tmp");

2. The host list for the proxy user - needs to include the host IP, instead of just "localhost"

3. After this, the proxy user cannot read the AppJar - since it was written out by the original user when creating the cluster (MiniMRClientClusterFactory).

4. Another possible issue after this, would be creation of additional dirs for job history on hdfs., Sid,
 I am not sure I understand 3. Why does the proxy user need to read the AppJar? When referring to the Proxy user, it is the user who is doing the doAs right? I like to use effective user and real user (real user is the user who does the doAs imitating other users and effective user is the one being imitated)., The appjar would need to be read by the proxy (effective) user - so that it can be localized on the NM.

4. Based on the johistory dir configuration - a single effective user may run, additional effective users per cluster could run into jobhistory dir permission issues., I'm hitting the problem 1

testValidProxyUser(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestMiniMRProxyUser): org.apache.hadoop.security.AccessControlException: Permission denied: user=u1, access=EXECUTE, inode="/home":<REPLACED_USER>:supergroup:drwxr-x---

Is the patch for this JIRA underway?

A couple of things:


#1

You changed the setting for the staging dir of *MiniMRYarnCluster* to '/tmp'. Why not the original resolution to the getTestWorkingDir() ? I know it resolves to 'target/...' and in projects like Pig/Hive which use ant and 'build/' dir this would break; but should you create a fresh dir under /tmp then? (using the File.createTempFile() method -you have to create the file, then delete it and then create a dir with that name).

#2

I had to tweak the test (how to create the list of valid hosts) to get it to work:

Instead doing *conf.set("hadoop.proxyuser." + proxyUser + ".hosts", "10.74.90.219,127.0.0.1");* I've done:

{code}
    StringBuilder sb = new StringBuilder();
    sb.append("127.0.0.1,localhost");
    for (InetAddress i : InetAddress.getAllByName(InetAddress.getLocalHost().getHostName())) {
      sb.append(",").append(i.getCanonicalHostName());
    }
    conf.set("hadoop.proxyuser." + proxyUser + ".hosts", sb.toString());
{code}

And then the test works.

Thanks.

, I've applied this patch locally and tested Oozie with it. The patch seems to do the trick to pass the proxyuser issue.

However I'm not running into the following error when trying run an Oozie testcase that submits a MR job to MiniMR:

Is this still related or ...?, I think I know what the issue above is. Ill upload an updated patch with the fix by tonight., Hi Mahadev, any luck with this?, Updated the patch with my changes on top of John's changes. 

@Alejandro, want to give this a try?, I had forgotten to attach the test file in the previous patch. This patch has the test case. 

I havent updated the patch that Alejandro suggested. John, you want to take it from here?, John, I took a very brief look at the patch. Changing the default history dir permissions is avoidable - they were specifically setup to prevent users having access to others history files. For MiniCluster, maybe these directories can pre-created with the required permissions?, @Mahadev - I will incorporate your patch and submit a new one with the changes alejandro proposed

@Sid - How does this work in a real cluster? I mean when oozie submits a job as a proxy user, I dint think the user had to be the same group or user? Or am i wrong?, Mahadev's tweaks get me a bit futher, but I'm still hitting some other issues. still digging.

Thanks., @Alejandro,
 Any more details on the issues?, I'm getting a bit further, now I'm getting the following messages

, @Alejandro,
 Weird. This is coming from an unsupported file system. Is there someway I can try it out and debug on my own? 
, Mahadev,

I was missing something, now I got things working. I think we are good with this patch for now. 

I'm able to successfully submit job to MiniCluster from Oozie, I'm now hitting the Counter's API change, MAPREDUCE-3697

This message is automatically generated., @Alejandro,
 Any pointers to re create the counters issue? Trying to fix it but would help if I can test the fix easily via oozie., Mahadev, John, 

Apologies for the delay. I could not reproduce the problem (the Counters$Group related exception) until Tom gave me a hint and thus the solution. I'll update MAPREDUCE-3697 with my the details of the Counters$Group exception.

The problem I'm seeing now is that I'm getting different Hadoop built in counters, before I used to get a "Task$Counter" counter, now I'm getting "org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.TaskCounter"

But other than that, things seem to work for what this patch is fixing.

Thanks.

Patch looks good. A couple of minor code-style things, YARNRunner changes have wrong indentation and the TestMiniMRProxyUser has some trailing spaces.
, Thanks Alejandro. Removed trailing spaces from Test program. I could not see any indentation issues in YARNRunner., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
