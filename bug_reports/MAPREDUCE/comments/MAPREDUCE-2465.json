[Here are the failures seen in compilation., This patch makes raid compile, but the tests fail like crazy. I don't know enough about federation or RAID to fix this., Rather than add my dubious patch that "fixes" RAID (but clearly does so incorrectly) I think it would be prudent to simply disable RAID compilation on trunk at this time.

Once someone from the federation project or the RAID contrib steps up to fix this issue, we can re-enable the compilation, but as is, this is blocking all progress., Here's a patch to disable the raid build. I tested that trunk compiles with this patch, and that the other raids continue to compile and test., bq. that the other raids continue to compile and test
....that the other _contribs_ continue to compile and test...., +1 - on disabling RAID until post-Federation changes are resolved., Committed that patch to trunk. I will leave this open so someone can address the actual issue and re-enable the raid contrib once it's working., I will work on making this compile, I did not see this bug - I have a patch attached to MR-2467. Can some one please review the change., Suresh, the patch for MAPREDUCE-2467 looks good., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #669 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/669/])
    , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #656 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/656/])
    , MAPREDUCE-2467 fixed the build issue and reverted the temporary patch committed in this jira.]
