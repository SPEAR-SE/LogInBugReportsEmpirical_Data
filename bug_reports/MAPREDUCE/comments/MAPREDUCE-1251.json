This message is automatically generated., Patch for trunk, against MR where pipes lives., +1 - started a new karmic VM on ec2, verified build failure, applied MR-1251.patch, and verified a successful build.

This should be committed to branch-20 as well. From the 0.20.1 tarball, I had to apply HADOOP-5612, HADOOP-5611, and MR-1251.patch before pipes would build (this same patch applies cleanly to that tarball). Doesn't look like any of those are in branch-20, but they all are necessary if we consider build failure to be critical., Thanks Todd. Also tested the patch against Centos 5.4 64-bit., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I've just committed this. Thanks Eli!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #196 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/196/])
    , This should be committed to branch-0.20 as well, since it causes a fail to build from release source on many systems. , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #235 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/235/])
    . Commit to branch 0.20
, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #233 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/233/])
    . Commit to branch 0.20
, I committed this to the 0.20 branch, Problem is related to header cleanup in gcc 3.4.
See comment in HADOOP-5611

This should be applied to branch-0.20-security and the 0.20.205 branch, This one has disappeared from branch-0.20-security although it is present on 0.20.2 where it was committed along with HADOOP-5611.
If there are no objections I'll reinstate it in 0.20-security., Committed to branch-0.20-security, 205, and 204.]
