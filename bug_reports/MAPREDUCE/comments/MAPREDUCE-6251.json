[Attached is a patch which locates the retry where it is effective in capturing the state and which provides a configurable retry count/interval which will address this issue for most reasonable "eventual consistency" timeframes.  Without chaning the overall handoff mechanism to not be based on DFS this is the best type of fix I believe we can achieve.  Moving to synchronous calls to report history to the JH is another option I think we should consider, but that is a more significant change I think we will want to consider down the road - in the meantime this should work around the issue for most cases., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message was automatically generated., Checkstyle not meaningful, see [HADOOP-11869].  Attached fix for trailing whitespace (also a questionable concern, but fixed easily enough), It is not just getJob(). Clients may also make calls to isSuccessful() / getCounters() etc and may run into the same failure. We should wrap them all up in a generic retry..

Does it also make sense for the server to throw a specific exception when this happens instead of retrying everytime?, \\

This message was automatically generated., bq. It is not just getJob(). Clients may also make calls to isSuccessful() / getCounters() etc and may run into the same failure. We should wrap them all up in a generic retry..

Those are all calls that happen on the job we are adding retries for here, so they are getting the benefit of the retry.  In fact, anything of this sort looks to go through this getJob bit, so it is such a center point

bq. Does it also make sense for the server to throw a specific exception when this happens instead of retrying everytime?

I don't believe so - callers are expecting to get a response for valid queries - e.g., a job which exists and is not aged-out by history, changing the kind of error they get won't help, they're expecting a response, this is to make sure they get one in all but the most extraordinary circumstances (not unreasonable)  With this change they appear to effectively always get one, without it there are a small but significant number of cases where they do not., TestMRJobs passing fine on my box, tried several times to confirm.  Assuming intermittent/build server issue., bq. Those are all calls that happen on the job we are adding retries for here, so they are getting the benefit of the retry. In fact, anything of this sort looks to go through this getJob bit, so it is such a center point
That's good to know. We should definitely rename the configuration properties then. The default retry should also be such that there is no retry - users can explicitly override if they want in the context of specific FileSystems.

bq. I don't believe so - callers are expecting to get a response for valid queries ...
I guess a different problem I have is that the retry is always happening, whether going to the history-server or to the AM. Given the problem is only in the context of JobHistoryServer, should it be localized to calls to the HistoryServer?, bq. We should definitely rename the configuration properties then
Done, now named without the "getjob" part (so "jobclient" generic)

bq. The default retry should also be such that there is no retry
Done

bq. I guess a different problem I have is that the retry is always happening, whether going to the history-server or to the AM. Given the problem is only in the context of JobHistoryServer, should it be localized to calls to the HistoryServer?

I don't think so - for cases where there is an immediate response (AM or HistoryServer), the retries have no effect and there's no harm in the retry logic being in play.  For the case in question, where there is a failure, the client/caller wants the retry so that they are insulated from failures and they want that regardless of where the failure originates (AM or JobHistory).

 - Configuration usually goes into MRJobConfig. Unless you explicitly don't want them publicly visible to end-users naturally.
 - Once you move them to MRJobConfig, the naming convention also changes. Names there follow MR_CLIENT_*, DEFAULT_* patterns
 - Document them in mapred-default.xml? Stating when they are needed, and how they should be used in contrast to the lower level retries., Updated with recommended move to MRJobConfig, \\
