[There's some obvious security issues here; once you have user rights in the system, you can't just say you are another user, you have to somehow show that you are submitting work on their behalf. That said, any front-end for the job submitter is going to have this problem, and as there is a trival hack to bypass the feature (which is in {{JobClient.configureCommandLineOptions}} incidentally, what we have today is not real security

# QuickFix. {{JobConf.setUser()}} isnt final; have your subclass make it a no-op
# Code patch: in {{JobClient.configureCommandLineOptions}}, only set the user if it is null
, Closing as won't fix.]
