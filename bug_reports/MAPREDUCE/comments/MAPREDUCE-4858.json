[A combination of MAPREDUCE-4328 and more importantly, HADOOP-8343 broke this.

Btw, not sure how/why HADOOP-8343 went in, looks like an incompatible change., +1 the patch looks good to me. , Looks good.

HADOOP-8988 is the issue. That and HADOOP-8343 should be reverted/fixed - a quick look tells me it can be done in a compatible way., Minor update to apply to branch-1., Thanks Mahadev & Vinod. I committed this for Matt to pick up for 1.1.2., FYI - I had to add a minor addendum to fix the merge since HADOOP-8988 isn't in branch-1.1. My bad.
