[It looks like this was already fixed in MAPREDUCE-4607, Could you please confirm that you dont have the code from MAPREDUCE-4607 in your repro? If there is a repro with those fixes then maybe there is some other bug., Yes.  I was missing it when the problem occurred, and when I added it in, it was fixed.]
