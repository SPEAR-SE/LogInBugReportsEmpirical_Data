[I think the current eclipse plugin build path is missing some jar.please try following steps:
in your $hadoop_src_home/src/contrib/eclipse-plugin/build.xml . in the "jar" target ,copy hadoop-core-xxx.jar ,hadoop-mapreduce-xxx.jar ,hadoop-hdfs-xxx.jar from your $hadoop_src_home directory. also copy jackson-core-asl-xxx.jar ,jackson-mapper-asl-xxx.jar,commons-httpclient-xxx.jar from your $hadoop_src_home/lib. I'm not quit sure which version apache-0.21 use, but it seems that 0.20.205 use jackson-core-asl-1.0.1 , and clouder cdh use jackson-core-asl-1.5.2, make sure you can find correct version jar in your $hadoop_src_home/lib. then using
ant -Declipse.home=/path/to/eclipse Dversion=xxx jar .
you will find your eclipse plugin in build/contrib/eclipse-plugin/ directory.
Good luck with that.
This issue is also similar to HADOOP-7382
Hope some hadoop guy fix this build path issue.]
