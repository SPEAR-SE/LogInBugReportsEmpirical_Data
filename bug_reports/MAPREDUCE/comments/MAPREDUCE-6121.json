This message was automatically generated., +1 LGTM, Actually, I just realized that this affects MR and Common.  I think for bookkeeping purposes, we should split this up into two JIRAs: one to do the FileUtil and DistCp changes (HADOOP) and one to do the MR change (MAPREDUCE)., - Move FileUtil* and DistCp* related classes to HADOOP-12159, Done.  Created HADOOP-12159., Cancel testing due to dependency., \\
