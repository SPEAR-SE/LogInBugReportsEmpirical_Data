[This patch exposes the issue. It is mostly just a port of the test changes that were made as a part of MAPREDUCE-4782., I really don't have time to work on this right now, if someone else wants to take a look at it that would be great.  It probably will just involve undoing the changes to NLineInputFormat introduced in HADOOP-7823., Bobby, taking this over. Thanks for your analysis and the test-case, it made my job easier., Copying changes over from MAPREDUCE-4782. The test passes after the changes., Bobby, have time for a quick review?

None of the warnings are new.

Running tests., +1, I am +1 too.  My only comment is you may want to delete out my debugging System.out.println calls in the test., But that is very minor and I would not want it to stop this from going in., I just committed this. Thanks Vinod and Bobby!, Closed upon successful release of 1.1.2.]
