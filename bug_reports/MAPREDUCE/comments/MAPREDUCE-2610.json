[Note that this class is deprecated on trunk (see MAPREDUCE-777), but its replacement in the o.a.h.mapreduce package does have public access to get to the queue and operations., Patch file, Joep, so this isn't a problem for trunk?, Don't remember off the top of my head. Will check and get back to you., No this is not a problem on trunk.
org/apache/hadoop/mapred/QueueAclsInfo.java
is deprecated and the new
org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/QueueAclsInfo.java
does not suffer from the same problems.

As you know both can be found in hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/java/
, This is also not a problem on 0.22, which is the same as trunk in this regard.
Both getQueueName and getOperations are public in the new class., +1 for the patch. Is this marked for 205?, I just committed this. Thanks Joep!, Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
