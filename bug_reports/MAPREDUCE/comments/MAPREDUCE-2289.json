[The central issue here is that the Java mkdir API doesn't take a mode, so whenever we create a directory, it starts out with umask-based permissions until we can call chmod on it.

Seems to me it would be safe and fix the race if we had it *fix* permissions if they were wrong, rather than bailing out. Then the race would only cause a redundant chmod. Thoughts?, Here's a patch which implements the proposed change (fixing submission dir permissions if they're incorrect), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
