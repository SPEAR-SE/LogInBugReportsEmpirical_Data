This message is automatically generated., Could you also take a quick look at the test failure.  It has happened for you twice. I cannot see how this would be causing it, but if it is not please file a JIRA for it, as I could not find one for it., Applied the patch to trunk and the test passed.  Created MAPREDUCE-4753., Looks good +1, I'll check this in., Thanks Rob,

I put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #2948 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/2948/])
