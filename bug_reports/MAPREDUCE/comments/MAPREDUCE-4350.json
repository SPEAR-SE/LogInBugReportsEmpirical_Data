Thanks,
Mayank, +1. It will prevent some task to write the same file in DistributedCache directory., We need to be careful with this because it is a non-backwards compatible change.  I don't think that it will end up being a big deal, but if someone's program need permissions on the files to be writable it will stop working.  It is minor enough I think documentation is probably sufficient, but I really don't know for sure., Yes you are right Robert but I don't think DC make sense for writing however people may have use cases for that as well.

I will create the patch and update here and we can discuss more about it.

Thanks,
Mayank]
