This message is automatically generated., Steps to verify :
=================

RM UI -> Applications -> Application(Job History) -> Map Tasks -> Task ID

Here task attempt page will open.
In the page, click on node link.
Earlier it was not working.. Now it will work

change in HsTaskPage.java:
==========================

Earlier the URL it was linked in anchor tag was http:///nodeHttpAddr
but it should be http://nodeHttpAddr

It is because "http://" and nodeHttpAddr was passed as 2 strings to method 

url(String... parts) in View.java

It should be passed as single string to url method.
hence the change as 
before :        td().a(".nodelink", url("http://", nodeHttpAddr), nodeHttpAddr)._();
after the fix : td().a(".nodelink", url("http://"+ nodeHttpAddr), nodeHttpAddr)._();
, Test cases are not required because it is a trivial change., HsTaskPage changed as recently as Sep18th. And I am not finding the problem you outlined on the latest code. Can you please verify once more? Thanks., I checked with updated code also. The same issue exists.
Actually when I raised this issue, there were 2 links in this page (one for node and other one for logs)
After HsTaskPage is updated (on 18th Sep) and hence there is only one link in that page (only node link) and i checked whether this has been resolved or not.. but that still exists.. 
so i changed the issue description removing logs link and keeping node link alone.. 
(Also you can see the advanced search boxes (in the attached snapshot invalid_url_latest_code.png) there for each column which is because of updated code on sep18th), pls check. Thanks, Hi, I find the same problem in the updated code also on clicking node link. This is because of extra slash in the URL. The patch is still not stale.pls review the patch. Thanks., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The IP addresses have changed to hostnames in one of the recent patches. Can you recheck? I have the latest code and I don't see this. Or this something platform dependant? Another screenshot on the latest code?, Hi Vinod, 
As you said, there is a change in the latest code (ip address is replaced by host name)

But still that problem exists.
I see it as a Browser level problem. I was using InternetExplorer only earlier and hence added the screen shot for those.
Now I checked in Chrome Browser and there its working fine.

I am not sure how it will behave in FireFox. I have some problem in firefox installation in my system. 

So I have attached the screenshots for other 2 browsers (IE and Chrome)

This issue exists in IE browser only. In chrome its working properly.

Thanks, Attached the patch. pls review. Thanks., Hi Vinod,

In Firefox and Chrome, even if we give URL as "http:///www.google.com" , it will be taken as "http://www.google.com"

But in Internet Explorer, its been taken as same what the URL we are giving. ie. as "http:///www.google.com" only. 

Hence the problem.

Even though the URL being constructed in HsTaskPage as "http:///hostname", its not getting reflected in the browser.

With the attached patch (MAPREDUCE-3009-1), its working fine in all the browsers.

This message is automatically generated., Test cases are not required because it is a trivial change, I wanted to say "I am amused that someone is using IE" :P But I kind of started liking your screen-shots, so holding that back :)

Anyways, thanks for the analysis. But can we fix the url method itself so that {{url("http://", address)}} returns a correct URL? Thanks., :-) here url method internally using ujoin method which is being used in many places. 
And actually here now i feel like no need to use url method at all. 
simply ,

{code} td().a(".nodelink", "http://"+ nodeHttpAddr, nodeHttpAddr)._(); {code}

this may be enough i think. Because I see the similar usage for getting node link in NodesPage.java 

{code} td().a("http://" + ni.getHttpAddress(), ni.getHttpAddress())._(). {code}

shall i proceed with simple concatenation or fixing the ujoin method?

Thanks, @Vinod,

bq. I wanted to say "I am amused that someone is using IE"

Just checked the date on that comment :p, bq. shall i proceed with simple concatenation or fixing the ujoin method?
Please proceed with a simple concatenation.
