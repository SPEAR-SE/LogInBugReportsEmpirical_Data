[One complication is that NM gets the shared secret from RM only after registration and the ContainerManager server needs these to be set for authenticating user requests. For addressing this, we can start the server, inform the RM, get the tokens and *set* them on the server.

[~tgraves] indicated that he can look into this, so assigning it to him., Steps to reproduce original issue:

on single node cluster:
- configure nm to be use same port as rm. (or another port that is already in use)
- start rm and nm
- view RM node webui (or logs) and see that the nm is registered
- After node timeout RM expires the node (default value is 600000), added unit test, Manually tested with and without security. Verified jobs worked in both cases.

Test procedure for the error case is the same as steps to reproduce above, now however the NM will NOT show up on RM node webui if nm doesn't start properly.

One minor comment I have with this patch is the setting of keys via the event. While this works, my concern is that if we do it this way, by the time {{NodeManager.start()}} returns, the server isn't still guaranteed to be ready for service. I think we can do this another way. If we move {{ContainerTokenSecretManager}} to the top level {{NodeManager}} composite, we can set the keys as the last step in {{NodeManager.start()}}. Thoughts?

Also, we can add a test for this - mock {{rpc.getServer()}} to throw an exception and verify that ResourceManager doesn't have any registered NM., Hey Vinod, thanks for the feedback. what is we move the ContainerTokenSecretManager to the top level NodeManager composite and also pass it into the NodeStatusUpdater so it can update it as soon as it register with RM?  That way by the time the NodeStatusUpdater returns from its start() routine and can start sending heartbeats to rm everything is initialized and we won't have any race as to when the RM schedules containers for the rm., Perfect, that should work. +1 for your proposal. Thanks!, review comments addressed., investigating test failure when run both TestContainerTokenSecretManager and TestNMRegistration, when run individually they run fine but together causes failures.   , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good overall. But it needs a minor update because of MAPREDUCE-2864, TestNMRegistration has a minor compilation issue - YarnRPC.RPC_CLASSNAME has moved.

Also, I am suspecting that TestNMRegistration can be simplified a lot with mock objects. Changes to MiniYARNCluster also look hacky, to pass in the sleep interval. Please investigate if we can leverage mock objects, I'll do too. If we don't make progress in a day or two, I'll push the current code itself. Thanks!, Thanks for the review, I'll update the patch for the config changes.  I'll take another look at the test to see if I can get away from using minicluster.   The issue I have with this is that to me it is a system/component test and not a unit test - when nodemanager fails to start another component (RM) should do or in this case not do something.  When I was looking it really seemed like to really test it you want all the regular init/start code in the nm so mocking that didn't seem useful.  We could perhaps mock the rm register routine which is what the mini cluster already does for in process communication.    , Alright, I took the liberty, went ahead and updated the tests. No changes other than the test code.

I still haven't figured out partial mocks/mockito-spies, so still using the age-old, extend-override-behaviour model for the test.

The new test is in {{TestNodeStatusUpdater}} and I removed the one you added in server-tests. Please look at it to see if it's okay.
