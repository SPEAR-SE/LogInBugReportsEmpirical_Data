[Here is a patch, Please find attached a patch which unblock me.
autoconf already look for unistd.h. So this patch shouldn't have any impact besides making Apache Hadoop build on Fedora 17.

I would also like to petition for including that patch in the upcoming Apache Hadoop 1.X release so Apache Bigtop (incubating) can update its Apache Hadoop 1.X version, Do we need this fix in trunk as well, or does the cmake-based build take care of it somehow?, I am in the process of trying and will update the ticket as soon as I get the answer, So I confirm this applies to trunk as well, And also branch-2, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
