[Summary of changes:

# Renamed TokenStorage to Credentials to better reflect it's utility.
# Added a Credentials to JobConf (and an accessor: JobConf.getCredentials) since it's the only per-job identifier in an MR application for the old apis, added a JobContext.getCredentials for the new, context-objects api.
# Removed as much cruft as possible from TokenCache, without really going overboard - we need to keep TokenCache since it's Hadoop MapReduce specific and I can't really put everything into Credentials as it's in Hadoop Common.
, Minor update to y20 branch., Uh, wrong patch previously..., Other than the commented out code, this looks fine for y20. +1, Pretty-fied patch., Renamed TestTokenStorage to TestJobCredentials., Updated patch, needed to merge more changes., Sigh, more merges!, Patch for trunk added., Added a test using the old mr api., 1) MiniMRCluster seems to have some unrelated changes
2) The ClientProtocol's version should be bumped up., New patch addressing the comments., tests, javadoc, findbugs, javac warnings were run manually. , I just committed this. Thanks, Jitendra and Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
