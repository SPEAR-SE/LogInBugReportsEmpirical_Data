[Job set up has not been done properly. Can't occur with we set 
MultithreadedMapper.setMapperClass(job, MyMapper.class);

I feel it is an invalid bug and can be closed., Can the code be changed so it works like I tried to use it?

I believe that many developers to come will make the same mistake I did. Making it work by subclass would make the api more intuitive , On the other hand, it's probably better the way it is now. Once you know how to use it, it's much easier to write a multithread code with it]
