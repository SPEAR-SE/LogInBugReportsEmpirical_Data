This message is automatically generated., Sid - we can't drop the allocation on the floor as in the patch. Let me think through this a bit more..., Simply setting 'type' of local variable 'assignment' should work?, Arun, the initial patch wasn't dropping the assignment. It was just setting the type - based on the first allocation. I didn't want to add setters to CSAssignement, since it's a read-only interface rightnow.
ParentQueue.assignContainer seems to attempt multiple assignments only at the root level - in which case the return type could be incorrect, but then it's never used outside of ParentQueue (root) itself., Spoke to Arun off-line. Since it's safe to have CSAssignment change - adding a setter is a more direct solution.

Uploading another patch - with the unit test from the first patch, and a slightly modified version of Arun's patch with a fix to the rootQuee/off-switch condition check., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
