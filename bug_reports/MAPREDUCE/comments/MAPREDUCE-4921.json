[Job submission calls a private method to get the HS token.  Proposed change to always use the RM principal instead of the renewer of the RM token.  The HS token appears to be intended for internal use (since it was implicitly submitted with the job) so it seems reasonable to always obtain & submit a token that can be renewed.

Internally tested, will try to write tests and submit patch if this approach is agreeable., Given, the history tokens are retrieved implicitly, and always given to the RM to be managed - making this change seems ok.

A side affect of the history tokens, in general, seems to be that apps which may have been trying to manage their own tokens, can't do so anymore. With this patch, any attempt to renew / cancel would break. An alternate may be to allow token renwal by the RM along with the specified renewer. Wouldn't help too much though, since RM management would interfere with the client managing the tokens.
, There is that side affect.  However the client has no cleanly defined way to obtain the history other than via a token selector which isn't a generally exposed api.  Token management is a black art that I don't believe hadoop components attempt to do.

Multiple renewer support might be useful.  Or if there was more fine-grain superuser proxy support so the HS or even NN could be configured to allow the RM to only perform token renew/cancel operations.

Thanks for taking a look.  I'll wrap up this patch., Patch universally applies to trunk -> 23.  I moved {{TestYARNRunner}} so I could change a private {{YARNRunner}} method to package scope instead of public., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The test failure is caused MAPREDUCE-4520.  I've filed MAPREDUCE-4936.  Otherwise this patch is clean., The patch looks fine to me I am +1 for it for trunk and branch-2.  For branch-0.23 it looks like the patch no longer applies (TestYARNRunner.java appears to have been updated)  Could you upmerge it?

I'll check it in for the others. , Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3220 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3220/])
