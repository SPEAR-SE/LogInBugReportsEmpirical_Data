This message is automatically generated., Looks good overall, just some cleanup needed on the test:

- The test should verify the task is in the expected state before and after sending the fetch failure event and the task has a non-zero finish time, otherwise we could be passing the test for the wrong reasons (e.g.: finish time is 0 because task does not think it's finished or finish time doesn't change because we ignored the fetch failure event completely because task is in the wrong state).
- Nit: The test doesn't need to sleep for a full second, probably only 1 to 10 msec.  Just enough time to make sure the finish timestamp would expect to be different if it was updated.  A second doesn't seem like much, but it adds up across all the tests if they sleep longer than necessary.
- Nit: There's some unnecessary whitespace changes in the patch at the top of the TestTaskAttempt class
, Thanks Jason for the comments.
