[Attaching patch for earlier version of hadoop. Not for commit here., Forward port of changes similar to what Ravi did for 20S

Requires mapred-1664, Patch for trunk for MAPREDUCE-1664 incorporated the code changes needed for this JIRA also. So resolving this JIRA as duplicate.

Hi Krishna,
 I see more code changes in your forward-port-patch mapred-1759.patch than what was done in Y! 20S patch. The code changes in your patch which are unrelated to this JIRA are in files 
Cluster.java, Job.java, DistributedCache.java and TestTrackerDistributedCacheManager.java.
If these changes are needed for trunk for some other reason, please raise a separate JIRA for that issue., Ah I have not looked at this for a while. Sorry! It is a mistake it picked changes from unrelated JIRA (1744) 

I will correct and update

Thanks a lot
Krishna]
