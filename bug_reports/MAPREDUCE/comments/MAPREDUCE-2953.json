[This should have started happening after MAPREDUCE-2649 went in.

Before MAPREDUCE-2649, immediately on app-submission, the application was created and added to the list of apps. So if the client contacts the RM with a _getApplicationReport()_ call, it returns the application which perhaps is still in NEW state.

Post MAPREDUCE-2649, application is created in _RMAppManager_ but asynchronously. So the JobClient submits the app, contacts the RM immediately for the AppReport, gets a null, fails in _YarnRunner.submitJob()_ (+248) itself., Thomas - should we revert to old behaviour i.e. pre MAPREDUCE-2649? Vinod pointed out that this will fix MAPREDUCE-2941 too.

Any other ideas?, changing to synchronously call the RMAppManager handle routine when submitting an application., You need to add synchronization to RMAppManager.submitApp?, I made the submitApplication synchronized to keep it consistent with the other routines in RMAppManager although I do not believe it needs it since the rmapp datastructure is already a concurrentMap and I don't see anything else that would be an issue., add unit test and expand comment.  TestRM calls the MockRM to test., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
