[Tracking URLs aren't available at the time of request since there is a delay between job submission and container assignment. Rather than poll for container assignment, handling numerous error conditions, I have opted to just remove this redundant information as well as the no long valid method killing the job., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., No tests are needed due to only changing logging to the console., Jonathan, will this be a dup if we go the route of MAPREDUCE-3387? Essentially, we will never return N/A and instead return the URL of the proxy for that application., Vinod, I also thought that at first. This job, however, prints the tracking url to the console itself, which has been made redundant now that the client service delegate prints the tracking url as well. I have then made this bug to remove the tracking url printing in the job, leaving that responsibility to the client service delegate. While remove that print statement, I also removed the printing of how to kill this job since that is no longer correct.
, Just committed this. Thanks Jonathan., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #169 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/169/])
