[Also, the case when Container crashes, the reason isn't propagated because of a bug in _RMAppAttemptImpl.AMContainerCrashedTransition_ which simply discards the diagnostics of the container. Also _RMAppAttemptImpl.diagnostics_ is also never consumed., Just found that MAPREDUCE-2952 was already filed for the main issue.

I'll edit this ticket to fix the cases where we are not consuming diagnostics at all., Vinod, you mean MAPREDUCE-2937., bq. Vinod, you mean MAPREDUCE-2937.

The patch mostly looks good, except I just cannot locate the source for RMAppFailedEvent.java. Late night work-jitters? Or is this missed in the patch?

Some other nits:
 - RMAppFailedEvent should actually be called RMAppAttemptFailedEvent.
 - RMAppEventType.ATTEMPT_KILLED is mostly a no-op, I can changes in RMAppAttemptImpl.BaseFinalTransition for this event can be undone., bq. I'll test tmrw on a real cluster.
Please do. The most common case we hit is when AMContainer gets killed by the NM for transgressing memory limits. You can try setting very high heap-size(>1.5G) for AMContainer and verify that AM gets killed by NM for 2GB Vmem limit *and* that the error propagates to the client side., Adding missing file and incorporated Vinod's feedback., -1 overall.
