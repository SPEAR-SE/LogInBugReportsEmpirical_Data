[Attaching patch, but can't make it patch available because it depends on updated jars from HADOOP-6201 and HDFS-538.  Please check notes in HADOOP-6201., I should mentioned.  I examined every use of the listStatus method in the MR code and updated accordingly.  There were several places were we weren't checking for a null and could eventually have it an NPE, but in most cases there's an explicit check if the file exists or not.  Not too many changes were required.

All the unit tests pass except known-bads TestRecoveryManager (MAPREDUCE-880) and TestTrackerLocalization (MAPREDUCE-879). Can't run test-patch as it detects the updated jar files and bails., (after applying HADOOP-6201 , HDFS-538)
