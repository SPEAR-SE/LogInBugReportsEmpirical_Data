This message is automatically generated., The close should check the timer is not NULL before attempting to cancel it. The testcase does not seem entirely correct, it assumes the DTR timer has been already initialized.

(In trunk and Hadoop 2, there is a renewer service, thus it has a defined lifecycle taking care of this), The new patch addresses Alejandro's comments.  I've checked for null before canceling and I've made the test call testDTRenewal() before closing the DTR timer (I had assumed it would always run before my new test, but that may not always be the case).  , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
