[Looks like Bobby's original patch from MAPREDUCE:2494 is part of the branch-0.23 line already., Apparently, that code is part of dead MRv1 dirs and we still need to implement this for YARN - sorry for my ignorance., Turns out that LRU is indeed in there (ResourceRetentionSet.java). Therefore, closing the JIRA.]
