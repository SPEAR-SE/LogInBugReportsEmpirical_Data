[Patch does the following: 

- introduced sending a sigterm followed by a sigkill when cleaning up a container
  - new config settings introduced for the delay between sigterm and sigkill 

- introduced activeContainers within the ContainerExecutor. Used by the launcher to set whether a container should be launched or not. If cleanup is called before the process starts, this flag ensures that the process is never started. Addresses race-kill issue in MR-3084 

- Getting the pid after the shell executor  has completed is unreliable so now task.sh writes the pid into a local file which can be read by the containerlauncher and used to kill the process. 
 

, Worked around things slightly now to have setsid be invoked by the executors and not from generated task.sh to address permission issues. 

Ran all tests locally on mac/linux dev box. Untested on secure cluster as of now. , Re-submitting same patch to get pre-commit build to run, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Build failure related to autoreconf. Will re-submit patch once build issues fixed. , @Hitesh,
 Its happening to my patches as well. Looks like something wrong with some of the build machines. Ill ping Giri to see if we can get this fixed.
, Looks like it's due to newer build machines..., Looks good, I ran both java MR and streaming jobs on secure clusters and things look good. +1, Looks good overall. We don't need the ShellCommandExecutor objects in ContainerExecutor anymore. Will remove that code and attach a patch to avoid one more review cycle., Attaching updated patch. This does the following in addition:
 - Moved ProcessFileReader into NodeManager module.
 - Removed the ShellCommandExecutor objects from ContainerExecutor as we don't need them anymore.
 - Moved the starting of SIGKILL thread to after the finish of the SIGTERM processing.

Tested this on a single node secure setup. Verified that the pid generated by LCE matches to that of the running container., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
