[https://issues.apache.org/jira/i#browse/MAPREDUCE-5888 Linked to this JIRA, Hi [~nishan] , thanks for reporting this issue. The job would hang if MRAppMaster does not shutdown gracefully because MRClientService does not stop. Is there any exception message *Graceful stop failed* in your logs? If MRAppMaster is still running, check for the port listening., [~rohithsharma] Yes *Graceful stop failed* log is coming in AM logs. 

MRAppMaster is listening to 2 ports

This message is automatically generated., [~nishan] Thanks for reporting. Can you paste the exception/error from logs when this issue occurs?

[~rohithsharma] Thanks for your contribution. If we move the *clientService.stop()* to finally, we will not be handling the shutdown error/exception instead we will be throwing to JVM. And also the exception message need to change accordingly in the catch block if we want to go with the current patch.

I think we need to add *System.exit(-1)* in catch block without modifying the existing code so that if any exception/error occurs during stop will be handled properly., Hi [~devaraj.k]Sorry i could not attach logs since the cluster is deleted. I will try to reproduce the same , Thanks [~devaraj.k] for looking into patch. I will update patch for exiting JVM instead of calling clientRMservice in finally block., Attached new patch that exit JVM.
