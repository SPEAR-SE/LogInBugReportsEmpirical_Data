[This part of the code must never be hit under normal circumstances for intermediate merges (during shuffle). We should only do single-level merges for the intermediate merges. I chatted with Arun offline and he agreed on this. 
Note that this part works as expected when it is supposed to be executed - for multi-level merges and that happens only at the end of the shuffle (when the fs is the localfs). 
We probably should fix this for completeness sake but it is definitely not a critical/major issue.]
