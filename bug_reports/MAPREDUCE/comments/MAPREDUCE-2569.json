This message is automatically generated., Looks good to me., Currenty, capacity at every level except the root level in the hierarchical queues is required to sum to 100% and throw IllegalArgumentException otherwise. This patch further extends this to required capacity at the root level to also be 100%, throwing IllegalArgumentException otherwise., Jonathan, I'd just move the check to ParentQueue.ParentQueue or ParentQueue.setupQueueConfigs rather than do it CapacitySchedulerConfiguration., -1 overall.
