[To make a clarification the reduce fails and retrys untill the retry threshold is reached, and then the job fails. , Log for a failed Reduce task that exhibits this behavior. In looking at the thread states of the remaining threads, it appears that the ShuffleSort has hit a deadlock, where for some reason the InterruptedIOException wasn't caught and so a Fetcher thread failed to complete normally. Not really sure why this might have occured, I'm not terribly familiar with the code base, although I'm wondering ifThis issue from log4j could be related https://issues.apache.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=44157. This is fixed in 1.2.16 released on April 2010. Hadoop is still using 1.2.15., Just tried out using log4j 1.2.16, and it solved the problem! So, Hadoop should look to move to the new version of log4j., Closing this as 'cannot reproduce' as log4j has since been upgraded.  A few times, actually.]
