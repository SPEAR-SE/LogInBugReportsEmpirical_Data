[Wonder if the DFS client is not timing out on a bad datanode.  In 2.4 the DFS client timeout was accidentally disabled, see HDFS-7005.

Even with that fix, ideally the JHS shouldn't be holding locks while trying to talk to HDFS since it can take a very long time., Thanks Jason ! We'll try out HDFS-7005 and see if the problem persists. , [~ashwinshankar77] Facing the same issue. Did HDFS-7005 resolve it?, [~suma.shivaprasad], we havent deployed the image with HDFS-7005 yet, so I can't comment. Also we haven't seen this issue come up again in the image without the fix.]
