An optional thought: add a comment to the definition of the getSplitsAsString() method in TaskImpl.java to specify that it will return the empty string for reduce tasks since they don't have splits., Thanks Josh for your review!

This message is automatically generated., I feel it is not correct to give the getSplitsAsString() implementation details of MapTaskImpl.java and ReduceTaskImpl.java  in TaskImpl.java.

TaskImpl.java can provide default implementation of getSplitsAsString() instead of making it as abstract and returning with empty string in ReduceTaskImpl.java.
, Thanks Devaraj for your review!

> I feel it is not correct to give the getSplitsAsString() implementation details of MapTaskImpl.java and ReduceTaskImpl.java in TaskImpl.java.

Yes, and this is why the patch pushes the implementation detail to subclasses.

> TaskImpl.java can provide default implementation of getSplitsAsString() instead of making it as abstract and returning with empty string in ReduceTaskImpl.java.

Agree, it will be similar that way. I have updated the patch accordingly.

I meant 'simpler' in my previous comment: "it will be simpler that way", not 'similar'., Did anyone had a chance to review the updated patch? Thanks!, I committed to MR-279 branch. Thanks Ahmed!]
