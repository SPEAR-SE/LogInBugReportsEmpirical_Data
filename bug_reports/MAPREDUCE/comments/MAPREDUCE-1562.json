[Attaching Hudson's console-output for the test from MAPREDUCE-890., Two things I immediately can identify:
 - One TT crashed because of jetty port problem, possibly related to HADOOP-6528
{code}
     [exec]     [junit] 2010-03-04 09:40:24,493 ERROR mapred.TaskTracker (TaskTracker.java:offerService(1460)) - Caught exception: java.io.IOException: Jetty problem. Jetty didn't bind to a valid port
     [exec]     [junit]   at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskTracker.checkJettyPort(TaskTracker.java:1276)
     [exec]     [junit]   at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TaskTracker.offerService(TaskTracker.java:1438)

     [exec]     [junit]   at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.MiniMRCluster$TaskTrackerRunner.run(MiniMRCluster.java:228)
     [exec]     [junit]   at java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:619)
{code}

I think we should fail *any* test immediately if MiniMRCluster fails to start even a single TT.

 - Two, I see this 15 min wait (!!)
{code}
      else if(MAPPER_BAD_RECORDS.get(2).equals(str)) {
        try {
          LOG.warn("MAP Encountered BAD record");
          Thread.sleep(15*60*1000);
        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
          e.printStackTrace();
        }
      }
{code}
Not sure why this is not causing the test to fail all the time., bq. I think we should fail any test immediately if MiniMRCluster fails to start even a single TT.
MAPREDUCE-1366 is open for this., Hi, I am not seeing this error in many of the recent Hudson builds.  Also I ran it several time without failure.  Is it possible this issue is fixed because of other changes?, Resolving it as duplicating of MAPREDUCE-1366. Seems like this where the real problem is.]
