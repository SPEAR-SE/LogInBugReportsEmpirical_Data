[While doing some work on the grid, I killed 4 task trackers.  For one particular task, the summary information still believed that tasks were running on those nodes:

6 running reduce tasks using 6 reduce slots.

This was clearly impossible, as there were only 2 pending reduce tasks that still had to be recomputed.  The map task summary information was correct., This is on jobtracker.jsp, not jobdetails.jsp., Looks like a familiar bug... I assume this was on the job 'row'?, Yes.

The total cluster summary was correct.]
