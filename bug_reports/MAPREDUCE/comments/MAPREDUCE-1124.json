[Test failure log attached, Fixed two bugs:
* The adjustment for length encoding out of the map was in the wrong place
* The reduce input bytes are taken from the shuffle byte counter, which adds at least 2 bytes for encoding record lengths, patch looks good. Very minor nit, the following statements seems to be useless now.
{noformat}
+      valsize = Math.max(0, valsize);
{noformat}, Good point. Removed., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I like the latest patch. +1. A few very minor nits:
- GridmixJob.java : unused imports:  java.util.Comparator;  org.apache.hadoop.fs.FSDataInputStream;  org.apache.hadoop.io.IOUtils;  org.apache.hadoop.io.IntWritable;    org.apache.hadoop.io.Writable;   
- JobMonitor.java : javadoc for "public JobMonitor(int pollDelay, TimeUnit unit)" has an extra @param element.
- ReadRecordFactory.java : javadoc for "public ReadRecordFactory(long targetBytes, long targetRecords,  InputStream src, Configuration conf)" has an extra @param element.
, Fixed javadoc (odd that it doesn't warn) and removed unused imports., I committed this., Patch for y20., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #196 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/196/])
