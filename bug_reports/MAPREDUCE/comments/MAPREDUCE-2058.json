[Can you confirm the specific version this is on?, I have observed this in https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/mapreduce/trunk@994941 as well as in the recent hadoop-0.21.0 release.
, Quickly looked at the code. JobTracker.infoServer is started in the constructor of JobTracker.
But FairScheduler.start() which initialize FairScheduler.poolMgr is called in JobTracker.offerService().
So in this period if someone visite the page the NPE will be thrown., FairScheduler has 'initialized' flag.
It become true when start() has called. (and initialized.)
So, I changed to return empty collection when FairScheduler not initialized.
, web threads have to be synchronized with the initialization otherwise there is no proper happens-before., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
