[Is this a regression of MAPREDUCE-967, more or less?, I think that it is a regression.  It looks like Yarn/MRV2 changed the handling of job.jar to be through the distributed cache.  Originally we only added the jar to the classpath as a cache file.  MAPREDUCE-4068 then changed it to be a cache archive so that the classes and lib directories could be added to the classpath.  So both of those together effectively undid MAPREDUCE-967.  I am not sure how simple it will be to try and fully implement MAPREUDCE-967 again, because the job.jar is going through the distributed cache and this really is behavior that seems to be MAPREDUCE specific, unless we want to some how try and make it generic for everyone on YARN.

That is why I wanted to have the client look at the jar and decided if it should be a cache file, or a cache archive.  From what I have seen very few jars actually rely on this behavior.  If you would prefer to make it generic for YARN I can look into that instead.  It should not be too hard, but it might require a small change to the container launch context., Actually I do think I will do it in a generic way through YARN.  I have taken a closer look at MAPREDUCE-967, and I see that mapreduce.job.jar.unpack.pattern is a user visible config that is now unused, so that is a regression.  I am not really sure how big of a change this is going to require though, but hopefully it will not be too large., I wanted to add in too that it looks like MAPREDUCE-3018 removed part of MAPREDUCE-967 from streaming too, because YARN did not support this., This patch should add in the missing functionality.  I have updated a few unit tests, but I also have tested this manually on a small cluster with security off.  I verified that it is doing what is expected., This change is close to backwards compatible with MAPREDUCE-967.  The big difference between the two is that the pieces of job.jar that are extracted, will be under a directory named job.jar instead of being in the main working directory of the application. , Oops, need to rebase it on trunk.

This message is automatically generated., Switching this to a bug because it mostly fixes the regression of MAPREDUCE-967, Few minor comments.

- Since Pattern is really only implemented for jars but it still handles zip, tar.gz, tar we should try to document the behavior better.
- It might be nice to add something like "even though specified as a Pattern" to the warning message in unpack in FSDownload.java, Also your patch doesn't apply to branch-0.23, I'll look at updating the documentation, and the warning.  Yes there is a minor difference between 0.23 and 2.0.  The original patch applied to 0.23, but not 2.0 so I rebased on trunk.  I will supply a 0.23 version with the updates as well., Attaching an updated version for trunk/branch-2 and another for branch-0.23.  These address the comments from before., +1 overall.
