[Currently ShuffleScheduler in ReduceTask JVM status displays bandwidth. Its definition however is confusing because it captures the time where there is no copying because there is a pause between when new wave of map outputs is available.
current bw is definded as (bytes copied so far) / (total time in the copy phase so far)
It would be more useful 
1) to measure bandwidth of a single copy call.
2) display aggregated bw as long as there is at least one fetcher is in the copy call.]
