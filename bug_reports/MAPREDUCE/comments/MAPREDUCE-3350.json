This message is automatically generated., Jon, like you commented, I opened it for the RM web app so that it works for all apps (including and besides MR jobs) which restart and recover. Depending on how apps are cached and stored in the RM, the RM page itself will give enough information about the applications and their attempts. Let us keep this for that and use MAPREDUCE-3299 for the AM side page which will be useful when the job is running while the RM page can be used beyond that., Need to add web services to the code before it is ready., Will appreciate feedback on this patch.

Specifically
* RMAppAttempt.startTime - should I wait for START event or is constructor fine.
* RMApp/RMAppImpl - is there a better way to return the attempts?
* AppAttempInfo - Should the constructor take an RMAppAttempt or individual parameters
* TestRMWebServicesApp - Should I combine the app/appattemt tests for compile time benefit or keep separate?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

[WARNING] /home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/trunk/hadoop-tools/hadoop-gridmix/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/gridmix/StressJobFactory.java:305: warning - @param argument "clusterStatus" is not a parameter name., Javadoc warnings are addressed as part of MAPREDUCE-4269, {quote}
RMAppAttempt.startTime - should I wait for START event or is constructor fine.
{quote}
I think it would be better when the app gets the START event in AttemptStartedTransition.  Make sure an unset value is handled properly.

{quote}
RMApp/RMAppImpl - is there a better way to return the attempts?
{quote}
We should be returning a read only version of attempts.  Perhaps we can create the AppAttemptsInfo there to keep from having to copy multiple times.

{quote}
AppAttempInfo - Should the constructor take an RMAppAttempt or individual parameters
{quote}
I think its fine as is.

{quote}
TestRMWebServicesApp - Should I combine the app/appattemt tests for compile time benefit or keep separate?
{quote}
Personally I would prefer them separate to keep the files reasonable in size and split up the functionality so it easier to see what failed, but not a blocker either way.

This message is automatically generated., Latest patch addresses findbugs warning pointed out by Tom., A few comments:

- can you update the web services documentation - ./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/ResourceManagerRest.apt.vm

- The Job block changes the name of the table based on if there was more then 1 app master - we might want to make them match:     
String amString =
        amInfos.size() == 1 ? "ApplicationMaster" : "ApplicationMasters"; 

- The table div is #job, you might want to make #app: +    TABLE<DIV<Hamlet>> table = div.table("#job");
- The new attempt table doesn't does have row/column dividers (or show up in different colored stripes).  The history server table doesn't either. Is that something easy to add?

- It might make sense to add the fields containerId and nodeId to the appAttempt webservices output so that it matches what the job attempt is returning.
- can we add a webservices test with multiple app attempts?
, Canceling patch to address comments., Added a test for multiple attempts., Addressed Tom's comments above. Didn't incorporate the row/column dividers fix since that is contained in the yarn css file and will affect all pages., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
