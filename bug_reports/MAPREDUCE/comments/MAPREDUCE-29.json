[Straightforward patch. The patch removes the JvmManager's internal class JvmManagerForType and all the methods defined there are now accessible via JvmManager. The patch looks big mainly because of indentation changes., Vinod pointed out that we cannot reuse the same jvm across multiple task types at least for the reason that one might want to specify different heap sizes for the map and reduce jvms. , Given the feature of different heap sizes per task type, this does not make sense to have anymore.]
