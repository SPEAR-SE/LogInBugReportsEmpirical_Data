[On this topic, what is the purpose of mr-jobhistory-daemon ? Is it just for starting the history server ? If yes, then should we really pass in the command to start, like:

mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start historyserver

Can't it just be:

mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start

and 'historyserver' is passed internally ? , bq. On this topic, what is the purpose of mr-jobhistory-daemon ? Is it just for starting the history server ? If yes, then should we really pass in the command to start, like
Yes, today it is only for starting the history server. But the script is generic enough like the rest of the hadoop scripts to start arbitrary command

bq. Can't it just be: mr-jobhistory-daemon.sh start and 'historyserver' is passed internally ? 
Instead I think we should rename it back to a generic mapred-daemon.sh to start arbitrary mapreduce specific daemons. Can you file a ticket?, Patch to fix this, was a bit of work., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
