 Am not sure I get the changes in the second part of the patch:

{code}
- if (mapId == null || mapOutput == null) {
+ if (mapOutput == null) {
{code}

Also, the in the first part, wouldnt it be simpler if it was something like:

{code}
try{
} catch(IllegalArgument){
} catch (IOException) {
} catch(Exception) {
} 
{code}


, bq.Am not sure I get the changes in the second part of the patch:

I updated this part, thinking mapid won't be null, handling this in the first part and returning false in the error scenarios.This exception happens when MergeManager tries to allocate location for the map output,so,  logging the same.

This message is automatically generated., Kamesh - you've removed the null check for mapOutput?, Hi Arun,
 Thanks for looking into this. I have not removed null check for mapOutput. I have removed only null check for mapId and mapId won't be null by the time outer catch block catches any ioe (considering this patch).]
