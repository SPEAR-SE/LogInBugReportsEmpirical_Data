[Sorry to come in late, the patch has gone stale. Can you please rebase? Thanks.

Given this is not an issue with MRv2 should we still commit this? I'm happy to, but not sure it's useful. Thanks., I'm finding your comments confusing (asking for rebase vs. pointing at relevance today) :P Since we do not support MR1 anymore in 0.23+, I don't think I need to rebase this, as your comment states that it is not relevant anymore.

We can close out! :), Not a worry in 0.23+.]
