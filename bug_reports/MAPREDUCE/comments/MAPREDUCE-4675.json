[A recent commit changed the heartbeat interval for small clusters that looks like it made this test race and fail. The MR parameter that was changed is final and so the test cannot override it. Working around by changing a different parameter that will change the heartbeat., +1, thanks for the fix Bikas!, Ran the test a few times with the patch attached and tests pass., Tx for the update, Arpit!

This looks good. +1. Committing., Just committed this to branch-1 and branch-1.1. Thanks Bikas! And Arpit for reporting and verifying the fix!, Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.1.0.]
