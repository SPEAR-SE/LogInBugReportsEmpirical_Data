This message is automatically generated., This findbug warning and test case failure is not because of the patch. Patch contains only js file changes., Sorry, to come in late.

The patch has gone stale.

Given this is not an issue with MRv2 should we still commit this? I'm happy to, but not sure it's useful. Thanks., It is no more issue in 0.23 and trunk., Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
