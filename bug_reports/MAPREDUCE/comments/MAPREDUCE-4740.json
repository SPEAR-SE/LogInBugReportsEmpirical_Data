[Attaching patch that should fix the issue.  It will not work if someone adds an archive with a # in it, and also adds it to the classpath.  I do not believe that this works in 1.0 either but i will test it on 1.0 to be sure., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., OK so the # does work on 1.0.2 if you set the confs manually.  I will update the patch accordingly., Updated version that allows for a cache archive to have a symlink name, and it to also be added to the class path.  This does not update the API to set this that will still not work if there is a #symlink in the archive being added to the classpath, but internally if the confs are set manually it will work, and the unit test verifies it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
