[Attach a patch. The fix is simple: changing MiniMRCluster to use simple name as the identifier; making it the same as trunk code., Hi, Chuan.  It looks like this was introduced in MAPREDUCE-5083.  The trunk version of that patch also made a similar change in {{MiniMRClientClusterFactory}}.  Can you please check to see if we need to make a change there on branch-2?  Thanks!, Thanks Chris for pointing out the JIRA! It is a little strange that the tests calling {{MiniMRClientClusterFactory}} do not fail on my machine. I think it is still good to keep branch-2 and trunk in sync on this issue. I will attach a new patch., Thanks, Chuan.  There was still a very minor formatting difference between trunk and branch-2 for {{MiniMRClientClusterFactory}}, so I'm attaching version 3 of the patch to correct that.  This will make maintenance easier between the 2 branches.

+1 for the patch.  I verified that the tests pass on Mac and Windows.  I'll commit this., I committed this to branch-2 and branch-2.1-beta.  Thanks again for the contribution, Chuan!]
