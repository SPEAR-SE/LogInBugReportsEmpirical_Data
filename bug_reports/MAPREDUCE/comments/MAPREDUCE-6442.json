[[~jlowe] please help review. Thanks!, Did you test this patch?  This patch will not provide the stack trace, it will basically do the same thing as before, since e.toString() and e.getMessage() are almost the same thing.  This should call the String,Throwable argument form of logging hat dumps exception traces instead of the single argument String form., [~jlowe] thanks for review. Updated my patch. , \\

This message was automatically generated., Latest patch looks good.  Was this one tested?, [~jlowe] thanks for review! I test by pass a null conf to initialize cluster and the log showed the stack trace
{code}
Failed to use org.apache.hadoop.mapred.YarnClientProtocolProvider due to error:
java.lang.NullPointerException
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapred.YarnClientProtocolProvider.create(YarnClientProtocolProvider.java:33)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Cluster.initialize(Cluster.java:95)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Cluster.<init>(Cluster.java:82)
        at org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Cluster.<init>(Cluster.java:75)
{code}, [~lichangleo] Thanks for your great work. How about adding a test for for checking the error message? Its test should be added as hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/TestCluster.java., Hi [~ozawa], thanks for review. But usually log based change doesn't need a unit test. Also for my change
{code}
catch (Exception e) {
          LOG.info("Failed to use " + provider.getClass().getName()
              + " due to error: ", e);
        }
{code}
that exception is caught, and error message merely gets logged. The exception is not thrown. Do you have any recommendation how to test that in a unit test?
Moreover, I have manually test this change. I verified that the stack trace is printed and I post the stack trace in the above comment., [~lichangleo] Oh, I see. I confirmed that it works well too. +1, checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2, branch-2.7. Thanks [~lichangleo] for your contribution and reporting and thanks [~jlowe] for your review., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8408 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8408/])
