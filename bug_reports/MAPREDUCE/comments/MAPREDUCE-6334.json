This message was automatically generated., Thanks for the patch, Eric!  I think the patch will fix the particular issue but introduces another.  What if nothing goes wrong and the transfer was successful?  It looks like mapOutput will be non-null, but it would be bad if we aborted the map output after it committed.  I think we only want to abort the mapOutput if something went wrong, so I think the abort logic should be grouped with the code that's reporting an error occurred (i.e.: in the catch clause)., Canceling the patch to address review comments., Thanks, [~jlowe]. Good catch. I have uploaded a new patch that addresses your suggestions., \\

, Targeting 2.6.2 per Eric's comment in the mailing lists., The change applied cleanly to branch-2.6 for 2.6.2. Ran a clean build and ran the TestFetcher test., How can i reproduce this issue. we had faced a similar issue.
, [~vishal.rajan], what version of Hadoop are you running?, yarn 2.6.0]
