, Just a question: after the patch, are we supposed to pass "-Dfindbugs.heap.size=..." when we run "ant findbugs"?, No need, I preserved the original value of 512M as the default.   However, if needed you can override it on the command line., Since this is a build.xml change, no new test is needed.

I have committed this.  Thanks, Lee!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #46 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/46/])
