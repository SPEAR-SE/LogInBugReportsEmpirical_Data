[AFAIK this has always been like this. The test suite was never intended to be running parallel tests as most of the test share the same temporary space. Unless anyone objects, I'll close this as WON"T FIX., There is a way to run tests in parallel using vmware, virtualbox or equivalent: have a VM run the tests off a mounted copy of the files. To get things to work best, set build.dir to something local, so that generated results on one VM don't interfere with the others., bq.

Are you saying that tests have hardcoded paths for temp. output, etc.? It doesn't seem like a very flexible way of making 'portable' tests which can be executed on different platforms with, potentially, different temp. location mounts. I think the rule of thumb is not to let tests to step on each other feet in terms of temp. data files, output and all that. , Most of the mapred tests write their temporary files to build.test.data which is set by the build file to ${build-dir}/test/data. In that sense, though it is not hard-coded in the tests themselves, it is kind of fixed.

Further many tests don't create _sub-directories_ inside ${build.test.data} directory, assume that this directory itself is empty and create files directly under ${build.test.data}. Though it is possible to fix this, it is huge task given the number of tests that need to be modified. If it is really felt to be worth pursuing, we can open separate issues to fix tests one by one., Another work-around occurred to me. If we can modify the build file so that each test can pass its own build.test.data directory from the command line, we can run parallel instances each pointing to a different temporary directory. Would that work?, Closing this as stale.]
