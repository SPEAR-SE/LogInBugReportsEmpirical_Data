[The MR project POMs don't inherit from a common parent yet (i.e. hadoop-project), so this is a fix which adds distributionManagement definitions to YARN and MapReduce., I updated the patch so that POM versions (and parent versions) are not parameterized (e.g. ${hadoop-mapreduce.version}) and instead have have the literal version number (e.g. 0.24.0-SNAPSHOT). There's more discussion of this problem in HADOOP-7506.

With this change I was able to consume deployed JARs. , +1 tested deploying to an alternate (local) repo and all artifacts are there., I'm no expert - but AFAIK the 'sanitized poms' were the ones with the substituted versions? Why not keep the parameterized in the normal pom.xml?, @Arun, I don't know what you mean by 'sanitized poms'; but the current poms are unusable when consumed from a Maven repo. The reason is that they done have a hardcoded version, then the parent version cannot be resolved, thus the fetching of the parent fails.

Another thing, as best practices, the version of the current pom and the parent pom should be specified. The version plugin takes care of updating both when you want to rev., Alejandro, please excuse my maven n00biness.

Here is the original comment from Luke:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2879?focusedCommentId=13091212&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13091212, Arun, no worries.

I'm not sure how Luke got that result. Pelase try the following:

Run:

{code}
$ mkdir /tmp/repo
$ mvn deploy -P-cbuild -DskipTests -DaltDeploymentRepository=foo::default::file:///tmp/repo
{code}

And then check any of the MR poms under /tmp/repo, you'll see that the variables are not resolved, for example:

{code}
<project>
  <parent>
    <artifactId>hadoop-mapreduce-client</artifactId>
    <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
    <version>${hadoop-mapreduce.version}</version>
  </parent>
  <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
  <groupId>org.apache.hadoop</groupId>
  <artifactId>hadoop-mapreduce-client-core</artifactId>
  <name>hadoop-mapreduce-client-core</name>
{code}, I'm not sure what the alternative to this patch would look like. The conclusion in HADOOP-7506 was that "mvn versions" can be used to update the version numbers in the POMs., Arun, any chance to +1 one this one? I was trying to use MR2 JARs via maven and they failed misserably., There are two approaches to solve the problem correctly (allowing CI to work).

# Add a maven-deploy-plugin config section in the top-level poms, a la maven-install-plugin to specify the santized pom with <pomFile>${install.pom}</pomFile>. This preserve the CI-friendliness of the current POMs.
# Convert all the pom.xml to use hard-coded versions and make sure everything works with versions-maven-plugin. You can test this by using mvn versions:set something-other-than 0.24.0-SNAPSHOT and remove .m2/repository/org/apache/hadoop/* and do mvn install or deploy to see if *all* the resulting artifacts have the correct versions. I don't think the current patch would work correctly as the versions in the dependencies sections will not be handled correctly.

I personally prefer the first approach as it doesn't require changing POM sources for CI to avoid accidentally mixing in the version changes in patches and flexible build profiles. OTOH, I can live with the second approach as long as we make sure it works with CI.

For various reasons, I temporarily don't have proper hardware setup to work on hadoop source, otherwise I'd provide a patch :), #1 is far from ideal, it is an error prone hack. Besides, this the pros you mention for this approach are easily doable using the version plugin (as it is done today for all the non MR modules).

Just to give an example, I was doing 'mvn install' from trunk/ today and the MR POMs are un-usable. If there is something special to do a correct deployment of them it is not the maven way and developers will get bitten by it.

A strong -1 on this approach.

#2 is the right way of doing things in Maven, it is easy, straight forward and any developer familiar with Maven (or learning) will understand what is going on.

Furthermore, as discussed when we were working on common/hdfs mavenization the maven version plugin can be used to set versions global for CI purposes. And I believe this is what is being done for common & hdfs currently (or it is the plan).


, bq. #1 is far from ideal, it is an error prone hack

It's a hack to workaround an open issue of maven. But it's actually far less error prone than the versions plugin (see below).

bq. Besides, this the pros you mention for this approach are easily doable using the version plugin (as it is done today for all the non MR modules).

No, the pros of approach #1 cannot be duplicated with versions plugin. With approach #1, I can define multiple profiles in settings.xml and easily switch select an arbitrary version combination with custom profiles in a drop down menu in an IDE. And it works consistently across *all* downstream projects, simultaneously. You can never do that with the versions plugin.

bq. #2 is the right way of doing things in Maven, it is easy, straight forward and any developer familiar with Maven (or learning) will understand what is going on.

No, pom version handling is still an open issue in Maven (cf. MNG-624, MNG-2971). Do you know how many versions:set command lines and in which directories, in order to change the project version just for hadoop-common? Please actually try it before saying that it's easy. The versions plugin is not an official maven plugin, it's a codehaus plugin to workaround the current indecision of maven pom version resolution. It's one of those most unmaven like plugins that mutates POM sources and doesn't work with profiles.

IMO, the current maven implementation (up to 3.x) is confused/conflated about dependency and build specifications. It should really have the concept of *published* artifacts, where the (parent) version is automatically baked, for coding signing, install and deploy.

bq. I was doing 'mvn install' from trunk/ today and the MR POMs are un-usable.

mvn install should install working (with versions interpolated) poms in your .m2 repository, unless someone borked one of the pom.xmls in the recent flurry of commits, while I wasn't looking :) Please show me an actual broken pom from .m2/repository. It should be trivial to fix.

That said, I can overlook the inconvenience of approach #2 for my working environment and adopt the versions plugin mostly because I don't want see the bogus warnings from maven 3.0.x :). I'm not gonna -1 on approach 2, as long as versions:set only needs to be done once (instead of multiple times in in different directories) to switch versions.

 , Maven as its problems, many of them, agree (I say we moved from ant/poison-ivy hell to maven hell, still we are better off, a few circles lower which actually means higher, or the other way around). 

Still, I'd try to do as vanilla maven as possible. This means using its conventions and expected rules/behavior even if they are not perfect. But the thing is, they are well understood by anybody familiar with Maven. And there it is the big win of it.

Cooking a POM on the fly and installing it, and that POM being different from the one you've used has it dangers. Many times I  end up digging POMs in the m2 cache; having there a different POM from the one that did the publishing will be confusing.

I don't know if something has been broken in the POMs and the versions don't get resolved when doing a 'mvn install', I was not aware of this 'sanitation' (that didn't happen in my environment) but it was clear to me that the POMs in .m2 cache were the same from my workspace because they were identical. Furthermore, if sanitation would have happened, I probably would have gone nuts looking where that POM came from because I didn't know about sanitation (granted, now I know, but a new developer won't).

Those are my concern against #1.

Now, going to #2, it is possible to update all the POMs in one shot if the POMs are crafted following a rule that is considered good practice in multi-module Maven, to have a common parent pom for all the modules in your project.

For example, if you run the following command:

{code}
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.24.1-SNAPSHOT -f hadoop-project/pom.xml 
{code}

You'll get all common/hdfs modules updated correctly to the new version in one shot.

*-f* is used to point to the common parent POM, the project POM.

When we normalize all the MR modules, the 'versions:set' would work for all.

I'm not saying that 'versions:set' is the solution to all our versioning handling, but seems to do what we need without doing something a bit unconventional and not expected.

Is this example using the 'versions' plugin to update all the modules in one shot what you refer as 'only needs to be done once ...'?

, A comment on the latest patch, it is a Maven good practice (also an issue of eternal discussions in Mavenland) that children have their version explictly, not only getting them from the parent (giving that we have a plugin to update versions this is not complicates things)., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., bq. mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.24.1-SNAPSHOT -f hadoop-project/pom.xml, You'll get all common/hdfs modules updated correctly to the new version in one shot.

Compare that to the approach #1, where you don't need to set any version and can just activate a profile implicitly in settings.xml or just use -Pmyprofile. You keep talking about the "vanilla maven" way without any references, especially in light of the history maven that they did attempt interpolation in 2.0.9 then backed out in 2.0.10 because it was half baked. I'd appreciate that you have references (like I did) to back your assertions up. The pom version resolution is mess in the current maven, and the approach #1 is the most convenient to developers for large scale projects. BTW, you forgot the top-level pom, which needs another command. The top-level aggregation pom also needs to inherit from the hadoop-project/pom.xml, in order to have a single command to switch project versions.

bq. When we normalize all the MR modules, the 'versions:set' would work for all.

That was my point, it's more complicated than you think and your latest patch doesn't work that way. I'm fine with approach #2, as long as it's made to work reasonably well, the current patch doesn't.

bq. A comment on the latest patch, it is a Maven good practice (also an issue of eternal discussions in Mavenland) that children have their version explictly, not only getting them from the parent.

Again, citation needed. You can't just make up a "maven good practice" on the spot, given MNG-624 is still an open issue. Aesthetically speaking, the duplicated version clauses are redundant and pollute the diff views even more, which is already the biggest downside of versions:set.

The bottom line is that the current patch does *not* work, you need more changes (fix the properties references as well as the inheritance change) to make the version switch tolerable., This JIRA on its own does not get 'versions:set' to work.

Before I've described how #2 works with hadoop-project/hadoop-common/hadoop-hdfs modules with one command (as you've asked as precondition to be OK with option #2).

Further changes are required to get all Hadoop POMs to work in one go with 'versions:set'. I've opened a JIRA for that, MAPREDUCE-3024.

You are correct, the root POM is being missed at the moment, a change has to be done there.
, The attached patch works with a single versions:set invocation, i.e.:

{code}
$ mvn versions:set -DnewVersion=0.24.1-SNAPSHOT 
{code}

Note that a few MR modules are using a property/variable to define the version of common/hdfs they are using and because of that the 'versions:set' does not take care of those. The correct thing to do there (IMO as part of another JIRA) is to make all those deps to use dependency management defined in the hadoop-project/pom.xml.

* It removes all variable versions in all POMs.
* It adds the version explicitly for the current and parent POM.
* It removes the sanitize POM logic.
* It makes some of the MR POMs to inherit for hadoop-project (the minimum to get things working, the rest is to be done as part of MAPREDUCE-3024)

Tests done:

* Runs some testcases
* Created binary distribution
* Deployed POMs to an alternate repository

Tests to be done:

* Run MR example of a binary distribution to ensure nothing is missing., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Reopening to track the merge into 0.23., Vinod, the protocol I was following was to close the JIRAs as soon as they are in trunk and to add them to HADOOP-7741 for backporting. By closing them once they are in trunk, in HADOOP-7741 they show crossed as an indication they are ready for backporting. Does this make sense? If so, would you mind closing this JIRA again? Thanks.

, Yeah, sure. Done., 0.23 patch which should apply cleanly for HADOOP-7741, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit #105 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit/105/])
