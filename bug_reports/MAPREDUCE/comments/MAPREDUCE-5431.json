This message is automatically generated., This is ready for review. , I figured I would ping this again as it's a very simple mod for review. , This should have been a MR JIRA. Please create mapreduce tickets at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE. Moving this myself for now.., Also, does 'pmackinn@redhat.com' have an Apache JIRA account? Have to assign this ticket to him. Or if mutually agreed, you can assign it to yourselves.

Now that admin stuff is out of the way, can you explain a little more on "exposed when running a mvn-rpmbuild against system dependencies". Harmless patch it is, but I'd like to understand what it is fixing. Thanks!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The dependency graph requires explicit call-out when building against system dependencies, because indirect dependencies usually get a pass when building directly from maven repos.  This is exposed when packaging against system-distro based jars vs. maven repo based jars.  

The goal in doing this, is to enable packaging on fedora. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
