[For this, I *think* we should display all sucessfully completed map/reduce task counters as the overall job counters for killed/failed jobs.Also when job has no sucessfully completed map/reduce tasks it displays
{noformat}Sorry it looks like job_<clusterid>_<jobNum> has no counters.{noformat}

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, the changes here look good.  Would you also mind updating the web services job counters to handle the same thing? Unfortunately the counter code between the web services and the web ui is not common yet. 

 curl  -i 'http://jobhistoyrserver:19888/ws/v1/history/mapreduce/jobs/job_1336487148705_0002/counters'
HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(6.1.26)

{"RemoteException":{"exception":"NullPointerException","javaClassName":"java.lang.NullPointerException"}}

Otherwise we could file a separate jira to handle this too if you don't think you can get to it.

, Thanks Thomas for the review. I totally missed the web services here. Thanks for pointing out. I will provide a patch having web services support as well. , Cancelling the patch to support the same functionality through web services as well., Updated the previous patch to support the same functionality through web services also.
