[Attaching a patch to pass the unit test.

It seems to be correct for me that the counter is not incremented.
The job is not displayed when executing 'mapred job -list' because the job has already completed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., TestUberAM timeout was reported in MAPREDUCE-5481., Hey Akira, I think TestMRJobClient expect to test operations for running MapReduce jobs.
So, modifying expected value doesn't make sense, it's not test.
Current implementation of TestMRJobClient has some wrong preconditions ( e.g. "mapred job -list" after job completion, as you said), and some part of  test code of which the result depends on timing.

We should consider that and modify. , bq. I think TestMRJobClient expect to test operations for running MapReduce jobs.

It doesn't appear that way, as the first thing it does is run a job and wait for it to complete then all the subsequent tests are using that (now completed) jobID.  A comment in testJobList even indicates it expects completed jobs to not be in the list.  I suspect the only reason this test passed previously was because the 5s sleep between the job stating to clients that it had completed but before it unregistered with the RM, so for 5 seconds a job could be in a completed state to the client but the RM would report it as running.  MAPREDUCE-5497 changed it so it now unregisters immediately after the job succeeds.

Arguably testJobList should have two jobs, one completed and one running, to really test if "-list" only shows active jobs and "-list all" shows all jobs., Oh, I missunderstood. I got it., Already created a patch before see this discussion. [~ajisakaa] do you mind I take this over ? thanks!, Uploaded a patch that fixed a few tests in TestMRJobClient, [~jianhe], thanks for taking over!
The patch looks good to me.

One comment, 

{code}
+    runTool(conf, jc, new String[] { "-kill-task", taid.toString() }, out);
+    // Killed task attempt_1379653489982_0002_m_000000_1
+    String answer = new String(out.toByteArray(), "UTF-8");
{code}

The jobID 1379653489982_0002 is different from actual because it contains the unix time when ResourceManager starts. I think the below comment is more correct.

{code}
// Killed task attempt_<jobID>_m_000000_1
{code}, Thanks [~ajisakaa] for the comment, turns out we can just get the attemptId directly., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., TestMRJobClient is failing on trunk, branch-2, branch-2.1-beta

The other test failures aren't related. 

MAPREDUCE-5535 for TestClusterMRNotification
MAPREDUCE-5481 for TestUberAM
TestNetworkedJob is passing locally., +1, looks good. Checking this in., Here's the patch that I put in branch-2 and 2.1., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.1. Thanks Jian!
