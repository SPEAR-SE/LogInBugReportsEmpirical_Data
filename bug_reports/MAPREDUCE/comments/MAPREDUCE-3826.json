[Similar issue was fixed earlier MAPREDUCE-3185, attached a screen shot of the message, From the firefox error console
{code}
Error: d[b] is undefined

{code}, This stems from MAPREDUCE-3746 where the HTML columns were updated but the JSON columns were not, This can be easily verified by running a single job looking at the RM UI apps list page using HTML -> cluster/apps?rowlimit=2 and JSON -> cluster/apps?rowlimit=1, Also fixed a small typo in  HTML generation, -1 overall.
