This message is automatically generated., +1, looks good to me., Thanks for taking this up, Stephen.  I think mapred should also return a non-zero exit code for this case:

{code}
  echo "Sorry, the $COMMAND command is no longer supported."
  echo "You may find similar functionality with the \"yarn\" shell command."
  print_usage
  exit
{code}

One could argue the no-arguments case is a similar situation where it shouldn't return a success code.  (Although I think the explicit --help|-help|-h case is one where it should return 0 since it's doing exactly as instructed.), Thanks, [~jlowe]. I'll update a new patch that returns a non-zero exit code for the no longer supported command case.

I also see that the hadoop and hdfs bin scripts don't return non-zero in the no-arguments case. My first guess is that no-arguments case should return non-zero (aside from the help), but I'm not really sure. If you or other people feel strongly that it should be non-zero, then I can upload that change, too., I don't feel that strongly about the no-arguments case, as it's an unlikely use-case where someone would care.  If you want to leave it or change it, either way I'm fine with that., Attached a new patch with Jason's suggestion.

This patch doesn't exit with non-zero status in the no-arguments case., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
