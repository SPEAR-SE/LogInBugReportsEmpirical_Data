[localizeConfiguration is needed in the tasktracker in order to set task-specific configuration options, but split.info does not need to be created at that time.  The patch moves the action of writing out split.info into a new writeFilesRequiredForRerun method.  This method is called by the Child, but not by the tasktracker.

Tested on a pseudo distributed cluster and on a secure distributed cluster that the permissions error no longer shows up and that split.info is still written out to the correct location., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Attempted to make sure that IsolationRunner still works, and it appears to be broken for other reasons, on both secure and non-secure clusters., +1., To elaborate on this a little further, IsolationRunner throws a NPE whenever it starts due to not reading in mapred.local.dir from the job conf before trying to use it.  IsolationRunner has been broken for a long time and was removed in MR2 (MAPREDUCE-2606).

While this patch doesn't fix IsolationRunner, keep.failed.task.files still has utility without it, and this fixes the bug that was causing jobs to fail every time it's turned on.]
