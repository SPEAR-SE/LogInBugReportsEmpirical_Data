[Uploading a straight-forward patch to fix the findbugs warnings., The patch is generated on top of MAPREDUCE-5077 patch and hence should wait until that goes in. , Rebased on trunk after MAPREDUCE-5077 is committed., we can probably dup MAPREDUCE-4239 to this, Thanks Thomas, the findbugs warnings look the same to me. Should have looked for existing JIRAs before creating this. For now, resolved MAPREDUCE-4239 as duplicate. In the future, will try to remember to search for existing open JIRAs., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
