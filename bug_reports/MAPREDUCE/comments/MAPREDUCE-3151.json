This happens only when running ant 1.7 when basedir property is propagated. On ant 1.8 this is handled differently and therefore does not occur.
Related to fix in MAPREDUCE-3025, Preliminary patch.
Remaining testing:
-run build test-contrib with ant 1.7 to confirm issue pre-patch.
- run same with ant 1.7 post-patch
- run build with 1.8 to confirm things are working that way still as well, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I have just committed it. Thanks Joep., Does the build need to be poked separately? It did not seem to pick up the last commit., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #82 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/82/])
