[https://reviews.apache.org/r/206/, This looks like a good change. A couple of comments:

* Can you use FileUtil#fullyDeleteContents() rather than writing a new one?
* The comment in the test for 755 perms should say "rwxr-xr-x" not "rwx-rx-rx"., This patch fixes the permissions string in the comment, nice catch.

Unfortunately I couldn't use FileUtil.fullyDeleteContents because that method takes File and not Path/FileSystem. Rather than filing a second JIRA to add that method to common, I just implemented it inline since it's pretty straightforward., > Unfortunately I couldn't use FileUtil.fullyDeleteContents because that method takes File and not Path/FileSystem.

I see. The patch has tests for this code, so +1 (pending Hudson)., test-patch and unit tests both passed (except for known timeouts). Will commit to trunk and 0.22 momentarily., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #33 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/33/])
