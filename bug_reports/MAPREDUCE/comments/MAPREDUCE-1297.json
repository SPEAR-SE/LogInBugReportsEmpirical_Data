[The only remotely possibility for this is HADOOP-5901 which has been reverted in trunk. And it never has been merged into branch 0.21. All other modifications of FileSystem and MiniMRCluster are well in the past (i.e. back in September). Besides, I can't reproduce this problem locally. 

Seems to be totally weird., Yes, this was caused by HADOOP-5901. I believe the failure occurred in between the commit and the subsequent revert. This should run again now -- I will post a companion patch for mapreduce here after we nail down a working version of HADOOP-5901.]
