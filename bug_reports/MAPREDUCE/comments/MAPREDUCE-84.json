[In fatc it seems that in this method : 

synchronized void ensureFreshStatus() throws IOException {
            if (System.currentTimeMillis() - statustime > MAX_JOBPROFILE_AGE) {
                this.status = jobSubmitClient.getJobStatus(profile.getJobId());
                this.statustime = System.currentTimeMillis();
            }
        }

this.status is setted to null because jobSubmitClient.getJobStatus() returns null
, I looked at the code and that should only come back null if the job has been retired by the job tracker (24 hours after it finished/failed).

I wonder if there is a race condition on the JobTracker's job map., The problem is that, in my case, it happens at the end of the job execution.
Maybe it is linked to the issue : http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-649, Has not been seen recently. Issue has mostly grown stale, closing out.]
