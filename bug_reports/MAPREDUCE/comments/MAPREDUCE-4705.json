[The history server is supposed to be able to serve out older jobs by scanning through job directories ({{HistoryFileManager.scanOldDirsForJob}}) if a job is not found in the jobListcache. The number of directories it is aware of is controlled by "mapreduce.jobhistory.datestring.cache.size" - which defaults to a reasonably high value.
Maybe this is broken at the moment ?, or we're trying to access specific jobs using a list API of some kind., Jason got to it, before I could, The problem occurs because HistoryFileManager.scanOldDirsForJob is using a job's serial number directly to lookup the serial number index (which would require an entry in the map per job) rather than the result of JobHistoryUtils.serialNumberDirectoryComponent which carves off the lower digits of the serial number, effectively grouping them into buckets of 1000.  I'll post a patch shortly., Patch to fix scanOldDirsForJob to use a proper key for the serial number index lookup., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
