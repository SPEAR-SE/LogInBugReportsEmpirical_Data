[We can hack around the issue by creating symlinks to the correct jar, but we need to drop the hard-coded version string anyway to avoid confusion., The v1 patch creates the needed links for TestMRJobs and TestUberAM., thanks luke, Ill make the change on the yarn constants and see if it all works!, I just pushed this to MR-279 branch. thanks luke!]
