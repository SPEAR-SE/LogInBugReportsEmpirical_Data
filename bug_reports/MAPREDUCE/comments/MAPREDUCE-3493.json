This message is automatically generated., Looks good. Can you also elaborate a bit more on what the ShuffleHandler is, in the description field? May come handy to some., As per my knowledge shuffle handler is used by reducer Â to copy the intermediate map results from mapper nodes to the node where reducer runs. is that correct ?, Yes thats right, but it is also a service rather than an instance every reducer runs. So perhaps a better description could be "Default port that the ShuffleHandler will run on. ShuffleHandler is a service run at the NodeManager, to facilitate transfers of intermediate Map outputs to requesting Reducers.", Updated the description., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., It strange that some times core test pass but some times they fail.Is that because some other process is running on port 8080 when jenkins runs the build??, +1. Patch looks good to me. Will commit it in shortly. Failing tests are unrelated to this doc change., Your last patch had some issues:

# Your patch's targeted file was an old, obsolete one. The new ones lie under the client 
# The patch also had a relative, sub-project path that isn't acceptable. The patch must be diffed from the root of the svn checkout.

I've submitted a new patch with these fixes, and will commit once QA gives a +1 again., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
