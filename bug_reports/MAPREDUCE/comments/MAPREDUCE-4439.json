[Fix the build first., Just added @SuppressWarnings("all")., Uh, we'll need to suppress findbugs jobs?, Meant findbugs warnings., True, Alejandro is working on it, as we speak., Oh, I just saw this issue after filed MAPREDUCE-4452. Arun, is that the same 4 FindBugs warning? -- One exception handling issue and 3 synchronized issue.
If so, we can mark 4452 as duplicated issue and put that fix here. , The immediate problem has been solved by an out-of-band commit from Alejandro where he suppressed the warnings.

We need to follow up with a closer justification of the warnings in the code. That part of this ticket is covered by MAPREDUCE-4452.]
