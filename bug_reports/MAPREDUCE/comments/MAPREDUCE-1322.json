[Looks like "mapreduce.jobtracker.staging.root.dir"  is not added in mapred-default.xml, but is added to src/test/mapred-site.xml. Streaming tests do not pick mapred-site.xml from src/test/. Is there any reason for not adding the configuration in mapred-default.xml?
, My initial thought on this one was that this config doesn't require to be tweaked at all (even by admins). It should typically point to "/user". But for testing purposes, i wanted to have it point to some temp dir. It didn't strike me that streaming tests don't pick the conf up from src/test. 
After thinking about it some more, i think it makes sense to indeed define the config in mapred-default.xml.

This message is automatically generated., Isnt MAPREDUCE-1139 the right fix? Also I see the following error message due to staging area sharing in testcases
{code}
09/12/22 19:18:10 ERROR streaming.StreamJob: 
Error Launching job : chmod: cannot access `/tmp/hadoop/mapred/staging/dummy44913967/.staging/job_local_0001': No such file or directory
{code}
Should we fix that here?, bq. Isnt MAPREDUCE-1139 the right fix?
That fix would address this issue as well but I'd like the staging directory to be defined in mapred-default.xml anyway.

bq. Error Launching job : chmod: cannot access `/tmp/hadoop/mapred/staging/dummy44913967/.staging/job_local_0001': No such file or directory
The attached patch should fix this problem (this happens due to the fact that the same /tmp/hadoop directory is being read/written by multiple users).
