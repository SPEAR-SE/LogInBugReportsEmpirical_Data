[Use same type of conditional as yarn's protocol provider.  The test and related files haven't been touched in a long time, so I have no idea how this test ever passed unless the CLASSPATH changed such that the service provider started finding the local provider class., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I was debugging this too and the reason that the test passed previously was because it was trying to instantiate a DefaultFileSystem, which with not config was file:// which there was no fs.file.impl.class for.

Also org.apache.hadoop.conf.TestNoDefaultsJobConf is more or less trying to test the exact opposite of TestYarnClientProtocolProvider.  For backwards compatibility I would prefer to see TestYarnClientProtocolProvider not explode if no configs are set, but just validate that it got a LocalClientProvider., Linking this to the JIRA that caused it so that if HADOOP-7549 gets merged anywhere else this can go with it., Essentially revert service provider behavior, and update test since a cluster with no config key isn't supposed to fail, but rather instantiate a local job runner.

The test was assuming that _any_ failure meant the cluster failed to init due to the missing framework key.  Yet the service provider assumes an undefined framework key means a local runner.  The test was really failing due to {{fs.file.impl}} not being defined.  The jira mentioned by Bobby introduced a service provider for filesystems, so now the instantiation of the local fs does not fail.  That causes the test to erroneously fail., Kicking Jenkins, The change looks good to me +1, assuming that Jenkins comes back with success., -1 overall.
