[Not sure if this could be the solution - 

IsolationRunner is a utility to help debug MapReduce programs.

To use the IsolationRunner, first set keep.failed.task.files to true (also see keep.task.files.pattern).

Next, go to the node on which the failed task ran and go to the TaskTracker's local directory and run the IsolationRunner:
$ cd <local path>/taskTracker/${taskid}/work
$ bin/hadoop org.apache.hadoop.mapred.IsolationRunner ../job.xml

IsolationRunner will run the failed task in a single jvm, which can be in the debugger, over precisely the same input.

Note that currently IsolationRunner will only re-run map tasks.
