This message is automatically generated., The failed tests are not related to arvo.  No new tests added for ivy changes., I've looked at the patch and also verified that it fixes the problem by running contrib tests with and without it. TestJobHistory failed without this patch too and is unrelated.

I am +1 for this patch. This should go in ASAP., Doing so now., I just committed this. Thanks, Nicholas !]
