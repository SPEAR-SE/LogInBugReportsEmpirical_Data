[When we start the NM again, as part of the registration, the following object will be created.

{code}
      RMNode rmNode = new RMNodeImpl(nodeId, rmContext, host, cmPort,
          httpPort, resolve(host), capability);
{code}

The above code internally calls  {code} context.getDispatcher().getEventHandler().handle(new NodeAddedSchedulerEvent(this)); {code}, which calls the CS#addNode() method. Here again this node's capability will be added to the clusterResource. In the mean time, the following part of the code throws exception

{code}
      if (this.rmContext.getRMNodes().putIfAbsent(nodeId, rmNode) != null) {
        throw new IOException("Duplicate registration from the node!");
      }
{code}, I have attached a solution as a patch.Can be validated., Bala, this is a good to fix bug. Can you pls add a unit test? Tx., Thanks Arun. I Will provide a complete patch., Hi Kamesh/Arun,

{code}
+        int time = conf.getInt(YarnConfiguration.RM_NM_EXPIRY_INTERVAL_MS,
+            YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_RM_NM_EXPIRY_INTERVAL_MS);
+        String msg = "Duplicate registration from the node!";
+        LOG.info(msg + " Waiting " + time + " ms, for registration.");
+        try {
+          Thread.sleep(time);
+        } catch (InterruptedException e) {
+        }
{code}

I think it is not a good idea to make the registration process sleep for YarnConfiguration.RM_NM_EXPIRY_INTERVAL_MS time when the node manager goes down and comes up before the expiry interval. By default this value is 10 mins. During this time node manager will not be able to serve any request.

I also saw the same issue for any scheduler and commented the same in MAPREDUCE-3070, trying to solve as part of that. 
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3070?focusedCommentId=13125711&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13125711, I missed the 'Thread.sleep'. That isn't something we shud ever do. We should just do the check early and throw, no need for the Thread.sleep., Will be fixed via MAPREDUCE-2775]
