[Oh yeah, this must've been a mistake in MAPREDUCE-2896. We should bump YarnConfiguration.ABORTED_CONTAINER_EXIT_STATUS to -2000 or something like that. I also see another ref to "-100" in ContainerStatus+75, can you fix that too?, Both unix and windows use positive range exit status values. ( unix 0-255, windows uses signed 32-bit int but used range seems to be 0-15000+). Therefore, given that we use an int, we are quite safe for now. 

The literals in ContainerStatus are there as using the actual variable name will require creating a dependency on yarn-common from yarn-api and that will create a cyclic dependency. Leaving the literal as is for now and just closing out this jira as invalid., Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
