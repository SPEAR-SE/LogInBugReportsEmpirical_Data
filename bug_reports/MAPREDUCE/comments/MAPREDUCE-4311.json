[The fix seems fairly straightforward - modify the capacities from int to float. The classes that call getCapacity() eventually convert it to a float value, anyway. I ll upload a patch with the changes later today., Uploading the patch with the following changes:
-Capacities changed to float
-Modified relevant tests to use floating point capacities (10.5)
-Ran the tests - TestCapacityScheduler, TestParentQueue, TestLeafQueue, TestRMWebServicesSched, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., lgtm +1, Looks good. It's a nit, but there are some unrelated formatting/import changes (e.g. TestApplicationLimits) which shouldn't really be a part of this JIRA. Otherwise +1.

Also this should be marked as an incompatible change since some fields and methods of CapacitySchedulerConfiguration have changed., Uploading new patch after removing unrelated cosmetic changes as suggested by Tom., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
