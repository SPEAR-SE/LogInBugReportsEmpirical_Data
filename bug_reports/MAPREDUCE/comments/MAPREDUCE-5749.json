[This has been causing failures in the nightly build.  Attaching the full test log from last night for reference., The problem is caused by TestRMContainerAllocator.MyContainerAllocator#register setting the login user to a bogus app attempt user.  This means anything after that ends up getting the wrong username if they're expecting the user that submitted the job.

The original patch for this "fixes" the problem by making the user for the job be the bogus app attempt user which means we match up filenames but it isn't really the right thing to do.

Posting a patch where we avoid creating a bogus app attempt user and instead attach the necessary tokens to the current user.  Also added a UserGroupInformation.setLoginUser(null) to the Before clause so we don't accidentally leak tokens across the test cases., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
