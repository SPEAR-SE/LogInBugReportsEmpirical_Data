[document the yarn cli. There are issues with some cli commands that still reference jt or have wrong usage but those have other jiras.

I also added in the hdfs user guide and hadoop commands link to the site.xml so it atleast has references to them.  I know they haven't all been updated but atleast you can find them.  If people don't want those I can remove them again., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This couldn't apply because I'm including the top level hadoop-project/src/site/site.xml in the patch. Shouldn't be an issue since this is just docs., split hadoop-project/src/site/site.xml into separate patch to appease jenkins. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., both MAPREDUCE-3497_site.patch  and MAPREDUCE-3497.patch should be reviewed and committed since I split it apart to make jenkins happy.
, Not exactly critical, downgrading priority.

But looking at the patch now for review anyways..., Looks good barring minor typos. Updating it myself.

The patch for side links is broken. Anyways we need a separate patch in common, will create a ticket., Fixing typos., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
