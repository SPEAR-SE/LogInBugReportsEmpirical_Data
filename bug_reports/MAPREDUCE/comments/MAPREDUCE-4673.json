[attached a patch for branch-1. Also removed unused imports., ran the tests for both the classes and tests passed., Could not find these test classes in trunk. so looks like it only impacts branch-1, Arpit, the patch looks good. One minor nit: wrap around the newly added lines to be under 80chars.

Once you do that, can you also quickly run test-patch and post the results? Will commit it once that's done. Tx., updated the patch with 80 char limit for the line., Here is the test-patch output
