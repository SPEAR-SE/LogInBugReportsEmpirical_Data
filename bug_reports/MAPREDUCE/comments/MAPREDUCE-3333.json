[It wasn't so hard to track this down, given one of my earlier patches causes this - MAPREDUCE-3256.

My mistake. AM now tries to create one thread per container instead of the earlier and the correct behaviour of one thread per node., Actually the code does look right, it creates only one thread per node. This is deeper than my first suspicion, still debugging., The exception trace gave it away. It is not the pool of threads, but the RPC layer itself. For each client, RPC layer creates a thread for connection/communication etc. With MAPREDUCE-3256, we need one client per container because of per-container token. So, the number or RPC level threads blows up and you know the rest of the story.

This message is automatically generated., Still debugging.., Tracked this down finally. With lots of help from Karam.

What was happening was that after MAPREDUCE-3256, we create one connection per container to a nodeManager and this per-container connection wasn't closed after its use. Soon, the number of threads created by Hadoop RPC per connection reaches the ulimit on the node's number of processes and java beautifully describes it as an out-of-memory error.

I put in a "RPC.stopProxy(obj)" call a couple of days back itself, but that didn't work because of the multiple layering of RPC in Yarn. It's time somebody cleanup that mess.

Attached patch should (finally) fix this. Cannot add in any automated tests. Testing on a big cluster only where this is reproducible consistently.

This message is automatically generated., Duh, still some problems at RPC layer which isn't stopping the client thread though I am making the correct calls all the way down.

Status: Still debugging., More digging up through the RPC layer and I figured I am running into HADOOP-7317 or the related HDFS-1965. We can use the same RPC client to connect to different servers, reuse connections to the same server but cannot terminate connections individually.

Two options we have:
 - Modify ProtoOverHadoopRPCEngine to avoid caching of clients altogether depending on a configuration or
 - set the idle time for connections to zero.

Either is manageable, effort-wise, I am doing the later as it is simpler., Linking the related ticket HADOOP-7317. Fixing that would make us not needing to set the maxIdleTime to zero here., Attaching patch that should set the maxIdleTime to zero for connections to NodeManagers.

No automated tests still, but did some manual testing by hacking a test, putting in sleeps whereever needed to take thread dumps of MRAppMaster. Without the patch and setting a huge maxIdleTime, the connections linger for ever. After the explicit setting of maxIdleTime to zero, connections go away immediately., Went through the latest patch. Looks good mostly.
- The close call shouldn't really be required with the idle time set to 0.
- Should RPCClientFactoryPBImpl call RPC.stopProxy ? instead of putting it in all the service client impls? It's a PB specific factory, so putting it here should be ok. Otherwise - the Exception in stopClient() should not be ignored.
- The client cache (removed by the patch) in ContainerLauncherImpl would still be useful in non-secure mode. This works for both though - so isn't high priority. Maybe a separate jira.
Haven't tried the latest patch. Had tried the previous one on a single node. Jobs were running fine. The close call was getting to the ClientCache, but doing nothing due to refcount checks.
, Forgot to mention - nice clean workaround to the rpc stop not working :) Thought it'd be way more involved., After applying lastest patch, Ran Sort twice and did not observe this issue anymore
, bq. The close call shouldn't really be required with the idle time set to 0.
My idea was to actually remove the maxIdleTime setting once the root issue HADOOP-7317 is fixed. I'll let it be.
bq. Should RPCClientFactoryPBImpl call RPC.stopProxy ? instead of putting it in all the service client impls? It's a PB specific factory, so putting it here should be ok.
No, that isn't possible. We need access to the proxy object in each impl. Bane of multiple layering in this part of the code.
bq.Otherwise - the Exception in stopClient() should not be ignored.
Sure, I'll throw exception so that it is clear if somebody calles stopClient() for a protocol that doesn't implement it.
bq. The client cache (removed by the patch) in ContainerLauncherImpl would still be useful in non-secure mode. This works for both though - so isn't high priority. Maybe a separate jira.
Sure, but helps to have the same implementation. Separate JIRA if someone needs it.
bq. Forgot to mention - nice clean workaround to the rpc stop not working Thought it'd be way more involved.
Yeah, been running with this workaround since nearly a week but didn't put that in the patch in the hope of fixing the root cause. Turns out that is the only short term solution, alas.
, Updated patch to address Sid's comment about the exception.

Karam pointed out a typo in the default-nm-timeout constant. Fixed that too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #893 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/893/])
    MAPREDUCE-3333. Fixed bugs in ContainerLauncher of MR AppMaster due to which per-container connections to NodeManager were lingering long enough to hit the ulimits on number of processes. (vinodkv)
