[If user list is not given, but user resolver is set to RoundRobinUserResolver, then IOException is thrown.
For other user resolvers, we see "Resource null ignored" as a warning message., Attaching patch fixing the error message for different cases. Also modified the meesage to be displayed for the case of "RoundRobinUserResolver with empty list of users causing stack trace with IOException to be displayed"., Attaching new patch with minor changes and adding testcase., Attaching new patch incorporating minor comments from Amar., Unit tests passed on my local machine.

# In {{GridMix.java}}, _userResolver.getClass().getSimpleName()_ should be _userResolver.getClass().toString()_. The reason being, there can be a user defined class {{RoundRobinResolver}} but in a different package. 
# In the testcase, there is an assumption that _writeFile()_ will create the test root directories and also create the file. One good way of writing the testcase would be
{code}
public void testRoundRobinResolver() throws Exception {
	 String root = initializeTempFile();
         Path userListFile = new Path(root, "users.txt")
         
         // test with missing users file
         .....

         // test with empty users file
         writeUserList(userListFile, "");
         ...

        // test with valid contents
        writeUserList(userListFile, "user,group\n");
{code}
# _testSubmitterResolver()_ and other resolvers should ideally test the return value of _needsTargetUsersList()_ and bail out. If _needsTargetUsersList()_ returns *false* then there is no point in testing _setTargetUsers()_ as their behavior is undefined.

Rest of the patch seems good., Attaching patch incorporating review comments and fixing SubmitterUserResolver to set ugi in the constructor itself as setTargetUsers() would not be called because needsTargetUsersList() returns false., Previous patch has some build.xml changes, which are not related to this issue. Updated patch is here..., Looks good. +1., Unit tests passed on my local machine.
