[Attaching a patch that instead allows the user to set the session timezone explicitly, based on the proper oracle database timezone name.

The existing code also tried a fallback codepath of setting the timezone to "UTC". This is not guaranteed to be recognized by Oracle. This default is now changed to "GMT", which is guaranteed to exist in Oracle, per its online documentation.

No new unit tests added to Hadoop for this because of the dependency on Oracle. I have verified via Sqoop's unit tests, though, that this addresses the open issue., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
