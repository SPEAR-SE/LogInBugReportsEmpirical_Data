I guess writing a test specific to the bug in question is complicated, given the current test infrastructure. May be later.

The test failures are unrelated. I am pushing this in., Just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #411 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/411/])
    MAPREDUCE-3713. Fixed the way head-room is allocated to applications by CapacityScheduler so that it deducts current-usage per user and not per-application. Contributed by Arun C Murthy.
