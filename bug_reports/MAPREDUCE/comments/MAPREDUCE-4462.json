[Linking this to the FairScheduler JIRA to keep track of the FS work., This patch contains both comments added to the various test cases, and changing asserts which use literals like "2048" to use "2 * GB" instead so that the units are not as easily confused by readers, I think documentation in code is enough for explaining 1024 => GB, I don't think this patch is required, may be if we just add documentation is enough. That is just my point of view.

Thanks,
Mayank, When I was browsing this code on the ipad, I did not have tools to jump around the code and I misinterpreted the units as MB, since the setResources(int memory) call had no comments to specify the measurement unit.  I saw that the other scheduler test code makes widespread use of this "* GB" construct, so I adopted it for use in the Fair Scheduler code., Dropping fix-version.]
