{code}, Hi [~aw].  This looks like unfortunate bad timing of different snapshot versions of dependencies getting pushed into the remote repo in between the builds of the individual sub-modules.  Running Maven in offline mode would resolve this by using only the local repo, containing local builds of 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT, which wouldn't be subject to changes happening in a remote repo.  I just tried a build of current trunk, and it worked.  I did a full mvn install from the root of the source tree, and then I did a separate mvn install of hadoop-streaming., bq.  I did a full mvn install from the root of the source tree

I think that's the difference.  I'm not doing that., Found the problem with a stray mvn install in another module.  Closing., Re-opening.

I'm hitting this again.  I suspect it's a race dependent upon a few things:

* what's been built and installed locally
* what's in the Apache snapshot repo

I suspect the daily builds populate the maven repo.  Since HDFS, common, and MR have been failing for nearly a week, I suspect that's why the snapshot versions are missing from the Apache snapshot repos

So yes, if you do a full mvn install it works.  But that shouldn't be required.]
