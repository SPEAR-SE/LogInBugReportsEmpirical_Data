, @Ravi, could you try out the patch. In addition to the fixes committed in MR-3158 and MR-3170, this patch should likely address the timeout issues in the listed tests. , @Ravi, forgot to mention that I still need to look at TestMRCLI and I believe I saw another jira around for TestDFSIO. , Thanks Hitesh! I applied your patch and ran TestFileSystem. It passed. I'll ask RE to apply the patch and run the secondary again., Hi Hitesh! Change in plans. Could you please check this in so that we can trigger the secondary? Its definitely a step in the right direction.

+1 to the patch. Looks good.

P.S. : Could you please file a JIRA for the TODO in TestFileSystem?, I can also confirm that TestFileSystem is passing with the patch. Am currently running all the tests. That will take a while, can commit this once that passes.

But before that. Hitesh, there are TODOs that you added in TestFileSytem, you intending to fix them?, bq. But before that. Hitesh, there are TODOs that you added in TestFileSytem, you intending to fix them?

Thanks Vinod for verifying. Yes, I planned to look at the test failure and fix it hence had marked the patch as a work in progress. There was a fix done to the command parser earlier which seems to have broken this particular test. , TestMRCLI seems to be broken. Fixed the timeout issue in it for now but the tests fail. All other listed tests should be working now.

@Vinod: TestWordStats did not run in my case. Also TestMRCLI timed out., Oh! Vinod probably ran with MR-3176.1.patch , while I ran with MR-3176.wip.patch, bq. Oh! Vinod probably ran with MR-3176.1.patch , while I ran with MR-3176.wip.patch
Yes, I ran the tests with the patch., Hitesh, please let me know if you need me/Ravi help with a share of the remaining tests for fixing. Thanks., @Vinod, @Ravi - thanks for running the tests and helping in verifying the patch. 

However, I believe the current attached patch is wrong and the actual fix needs to be applied in ReduceTask as to how it detects whether the job is local or not. Trivial change to the code to now do the following: 

if framework not set and master address is local, assume local runner 
else if framework set and framework == local, assume local runner 
else not a local runner 

Running the tests locally at the moment - will send out an update once it completes. 

, Did not run the ant tests fully but this patch addresses all the timing out issues.

Addressed a couple of other failures in the other listed failed tests. 

Will open separate jiras for the other failure cases that are not related to the timing out issues.
