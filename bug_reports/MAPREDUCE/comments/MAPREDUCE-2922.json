[Thomas, can we drop this since MAPREDUCE-2767 went it?

If so, please go ahead and close this as 'duplicate'. Thanks., Yes this can go away, of course now streaming errors out when doing the ant tar command because it tries to use the task-controller test stuff that was removed, but that is a separate issue.]
