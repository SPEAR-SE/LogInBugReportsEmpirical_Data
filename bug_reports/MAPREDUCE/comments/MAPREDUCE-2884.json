[Would this also affect -libjars on Hadoop 2 (Cloudera's CDH4) when running using YARN in pseudo-distributed mode?

- Referring to: http://www.cloudera.com/blog/2011/01/how-to-include-third-party-libraries-in-your-map-reduce-job/
- With Hadoop 1 (Cloudera's CDH3) I had been packaging all my dependencies into the jar option (2). This did not work when I upgraded to Hadoop 2.
- Reading the update on the article: I concluded that option(2) has been deprecated. 
- So I attempted to use option (1) -libjars and this did not appear to work either.
- I resorted to option (3) copying jars around manually and this works.

Debugging I saw that the ToolRunner was populating "tmpjars" with the contents of -libjars so concluded that this issue may be related.
