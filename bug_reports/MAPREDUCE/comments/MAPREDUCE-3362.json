[Hi Denny,

By any chance are you falling into this scenario:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2129?focusedCommentId=13081564&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13081564, I think the 2 scenarios are different. 

The scenario in this issue is the Map/Reduce tasks in this job are done, but the job still stay pending. The root cause is the ConcurrentModificationException, if the exception happen, the counter is wrong.]
