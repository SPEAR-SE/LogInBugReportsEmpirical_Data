[Hey Santhosh,

Can you sketch out some more plans on how this can be done?

I also wonder if JobControl ought to be improved further or should we be recommending Apache Oozie?, Its been many years since I filed this ticket. From what I can recollect, I had problems when JobControl failed due to non IOExceptions and this resulted in the Pig script failure. 

This might no longer be relevant. Also, I tried different mechanisms to reproduce this problem and I was not able to. Probably, it was a transient error. Nevertheless, I filed this JIRA to track this issue.

If this is no longer relevant, please feel free to resolve this as won't fix or mark it as the duplicate of the JIRA that fixed this issue., Thank you Santhosh. Resolving as Not a Problem (currently/anymore). In case we face similar issues with JobControl in the future, lets file a new JIRA.]
