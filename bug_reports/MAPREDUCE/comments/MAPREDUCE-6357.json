[[~ivanmi], do you have plans to work on this one?  If not, I can go ahead and make the change., Thanks [~cotedm], please feel free to take it up., Thanks [~ivanmi]!  I figured that I just ran into this same situation the other day, so it's fresh in my mind.  I'll try to get a bite on the first draft of the change this week., Submitting the javadoc changes.  Please let me know if anything look amiss.  Thanks!, \\
