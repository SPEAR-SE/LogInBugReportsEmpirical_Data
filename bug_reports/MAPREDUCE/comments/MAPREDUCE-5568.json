This message is automatically generated., [~jianhe] This is a simple fix, and wanted to see if you can review it.  Thanks again!  -MinJi, [~minjikim], thanks for your contribution. patch looks good, just some format issues:
- the convention is to use two spaces for indentation.
{code}
    if ( getTotalMaps() == 0 ) {
        report.setMapProgress(1.0f);
    } else {
    report.setMapProgress((float) getCompletedMaps() / getTotalMaps());
    }
    if ( getTotalReduces() == 0 ) {
        report.setReduceProgress(1.0f);
    } else {
    report.setReduceProgress((float) getCompletedReduces() / getTotalReduces());
    }
{code}, With correct spacing., [~jianhe], thanks for reviewing this!  I fixed the space issue and uploaded a new patch04.  Let me know if there is anything else that needs to be done.  Thanks! -MinJi, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
