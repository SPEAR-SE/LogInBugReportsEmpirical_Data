This message is automatically generated., Able to apply this patch locally, checked with some other machines also. Not sure why applying of patch is failing in Jenkins. No logs also available.Any help?, Tried multiple times in local, no sure why it is failing to apply in Hudson., @Defaraj

Several of the lines in the patch seem to have <ctl>-M (^M) at the end. Could that be it?, Devaraj - we don't need both 'tracking url' and 'history url'.

trackingUrl == historyUrl for completed jobs., Thanks Arun for reviewing.

bq. trackingUrl == historyUrl for completed jobs.

Here history URL is different from Tracking URL. 
 
history URL is the job history file location in the DFS for completed jobs and empty for Running Jobs. I feel the label can be renamed to "History file URL" for better readability., Updated the patch based on the changes on the trunk. 'history URL' is renamed to 'History file URL'., Devaraj - sorry if I wasn't clear.

In MRv2 there is no history url until the job completes. Once the job completes there is no 'tracking url' since the MR AppMaster goes away.

Thus, we can use the same field i.e. trackingUrl without adding another one.

Makes sense?, It is fine Arun,  any way History URL gives the complete information present in Job history file. This additional field can be removed.

I will update the patch with these changes

Can you please check why the patch can't be applied by hudson?

Maybe it's got to do with ^M?

If not, can you please run:
# mvn clean install to run all tests (incl. integration tests) and paste output?
# AlPlease run old tests i.e ant test to make sure.

Also, can you pls paste the latest output? Thanks!

Meanwhile I'll run this on a secure cluster to test. , Oh, you need to rebase too..., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Also, shouldn't we do the check of amTrackingUrl v/s historyTrackingUrl in ClientServiceDelegate rather than in TypeConvertor.fromYarn? That way TypeConvertor is simple., Sorry to give you a hard time on this, but I really think we are close.

I can be up for another hour or so if you can fix the last nit and I'll commit. Thanks!, I'm sorry for the delay and disturbance to you.

I ran 'ant test', failing few testcases in my environment(with timeout) which fails without patch also and those are not related to the patch changes. The above change doesn't impact the MR CLI tests because that history url is not referring any where in the code from the toString() method.

I have moved the tracking url check to the ClientServiceDelegate.
