[jersey has a built in support for a GZIP content encoding filter that just needs to be configured on., Unfortunately I don't see an easy way to add a unit test for this. The test framework now is setup to test particular web services, like RM, NM, etc. And there is no unit test framework in place for the core webapp functionality., Manually tested: (did similar for all rm,nm,app master, history server)

curl  --compressed -D header.txt  -X GET "http://host.domain.com:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps" 

header:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(6.1.26)


curl handles decompressing when using the --compressed output so it comes out in json as expected.

----

curl  -D header.txt  -X GET "http://host.domain.com:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps" 

header:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/json
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(6.1.26)

again output in json no compression

-----
 curl  -D header.txt -H "Accept-Encoding: gzip"   -X GET "http://host.domain.com:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps"

HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/json
Content-Encoding: gzip
Transfer-Encoding: chunked
Server: Jetty(6.1.26)

output comes out in binary gzip

----
curl  --compressed -D header.txt  -H "Accept: application/xml" -X GET "http://host.domain.com:8088/ws/v1/cluster/apps" 

header:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/plain; charset=utf-8
Content-Type: application/xml
Content-Encoding: gzip
Content-Length: 479
Server: Jetty(6.1.26)

output comes out in xml as curl handles decompressing, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
