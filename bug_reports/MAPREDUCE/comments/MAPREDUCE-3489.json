[Definately System.exit is not the right thing in a library. Sigh! I knew that when I wrote that and intended to remove it. Couldn't get chance to get to it. 
I think we should get rid of it and instead have a error handling callback registered to Dispatcher., The issue of failing silently should be fixed after MAPREDUCE-3634. There, I have changed the behavior of crashing dispatcher during tests to instead throw exceptions. We will still need some kind of a call-back so that tests can fail better. Currently all tests take care of this by explicit checks and timeouts., let me take a stab at this., bq. let me take a stab at this.
Great, thanks!, Currently in the AsyncDispatcher, exitOnDispatchException defaults to false. The daemon don't set it to true either. Is this the intended bahaviour ? I think daemons should exit on dispatcher error while testcases can handle it differently. right ?, bq. Currently in the AsyncDispatcher, exitOnDispatchException defaults to false. The daemon don't set it to true either.
That is done as part of MAPREDUCE-3634 which isn't committed yet. Appreciate a quick review there ;)

You can develop your patch over MAPREDUCE-3634., Is this jira still an issue?, bq. Is this jira still an issue?
Yes, it is. But it's minor.]
