This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch, [~liangly].  Patch looks good overall.  Would like to see the code properly indented within the synchronized blocks to match the Hadoop coding guidelines.

Another minor nit is that the code is holding the locks longer than necessary (only need to lock fileinfo until data is parsed) but not a must-fix since it's just test code., Incorporate Jason Lowe 's comment.
