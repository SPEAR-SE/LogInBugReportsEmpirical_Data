[Same type of issues for HDFS., Restore HADOOP_COMMON_HOME and environment based control. This was removed per Owen's request to make the system more secure without depending on environment variables.

This revision will check for $HADOOP_PREFIX/libexec/hadoop-config.sh exists. If libexec/hadoop-config.sh exists, it will be used. If libexec/hadoop-config.sh does not exist, then it falls back to developer environment setup.
, Does this change apply to trunk as well? I had been using the HADOOP_HDFS_HOME/HADOOP_COMMON_HOME/HADOOP_MAPRED_HOME vars with trunk and it was pretty much working until I updated today.

This message is automatically generated., +1. I applied the patch to trunk and can confirm that `bin/mapred' did not work without this patch, and does work with it., Do we need the following export?
+export HADOOP_PREFIX="${HADOOP_PREFIX:-$bin/..}"

the sourcing of {{hadoop-config.sh}} should set this to point at COMMON_HOME in dev env or the appropriate prefix in an installed env, right?, bq. Do we need the following export?
bq. +export HADOOP_PREFIX="${HADOOP_PREFIX:-$bin/..}"

This is required for "ant tar" release tarball deployment without merging the artificates to the same directory, and used COMMON_HOME to drive environments., Anyone wants to commit this?, Todd, are you satisfied with Eric's response to your question? If so, I'll go ahead and commit this., Never mind - I can't commit this since it's M/R. :P

Todd, are you satisfied with Eric's response to your question? If so, would you mind committing this?, Sorry for slow response, I missed this in my jira box.

Eric: my point is that the next thing after "export HADOOP_PREFIX=..." is to source hadoop-config.sh (wherever it might be found). The first export in that file is to export HADOOP_PREFIX again. So regardless of whether this is a dev env or installed env, the export in mapred-config.sh should be redundant, no?, Same patch with HADOOP_PREFIX removed from mapred-config.sh., Todd, thanks for catching the duplicates.  :), -1 overall.

mapred-config.sh searches for hadoop-config.sh in bin. Whereas after the recent mavenization and restructuring, if I had done 
{noformat} $ mvn -Pdist install {noformat} in the top level directory then, hadoop-config.sh is put in libexec.

Can we please include this case too?, Arun updated the incremental changes of the script in MAPREDUCE-2885.  Resolve this as fixed.]
