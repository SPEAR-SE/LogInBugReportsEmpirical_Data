[bq. We should have intermediate adaptor class to implement Tools for the purpose of submitting jobs via m/r, streaming, pipes so that we don't miss some core functionality.
Streaming and Pipes implement Tools after HADOOP-3722.

Patch removes the job monitoring code from streaming and calls JobClient.monitorAndPrintJob(), which is exhaustive.

, I ran a streaming job which fails. With the patch, i see all the task completion events and task logs printed on the console., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The patch improves the console output whenever a streaming job is run. Manually tested the patch by running failing streaming job and successful streaming job. , Patch looks good.
