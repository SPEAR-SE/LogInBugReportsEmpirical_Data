More context:
- The regular mode cleans up the history files after a month. The history filenames use yyyy/mm/dd.
- The debug mode cleans up the history files after 20 minutes. The history filenames (currently) use yyyy/hour/min.

The DEBUG_MODE overloads the regular mode. Instead, a better approach seems to be to append to the regular mode, instead of overloading it.

Also, the config parameter to turn the DEBUG_MODE on/off mapreduce.jobhistory.debug.mode doesn't have a default in mapred-default.xml and needs to be added., Uploading a preliminary patch. The patch -
- adds hour/min fields to the file names in DEBUG_MODE, The DEBUG_MODE seems to be doing a lot of things. It has a shorter cleanup time for history files, history filenames use different timestamps, prints stack traces at various points in the code.

Given that the config option was not present in the mapred-default.xml so far, I wonder if anyone is aware of and using DEBUG_MODE at all. One option is to remove the DEBUG_MODE and do the following instead:
- Add a config-parameter for history cleanup
- Replace instances of debug-printing with LOG.debug()
- To address the ability to verify shorter cleanup times, add the hour/min to the history filenames., DEBUG_MODE for the history server is present also in trunk and 2.0 as well.

I don't believe that anyone is using it, but there could be a few people using it to test the history server outside of Hadoop proper.  I am +1 for removing it.  I don't see much of a reason to change anything at this point except to rip it out, and amybe make the debug-printing LOG.debug.  If someone else wants similar functionality for testing we can add in targeted configs to do things like what Karthik is suggesting., Karthik,

If DEBUG_MODE is there only for the purposes of reducing the hardcoded cleanup time, then I agree we should make this configurable. Default value should be the current 'non-debug' max age of 1 month. We should have a consistent directory layout regardless of the cleanup time, I'd suggest using yyyy/mm/dd-HH-MM, to avoid having a subdir explosion. the cleanup logic should be smart enough to look at the necessary granularity in the name. Regarding the printing of stack traces, those should be converted to LOG.trace() calls. Make sense?, Robert and Alejandro,

Thanks for your comments. Given your inputs, the best way forward might be to (1) remove DEBUG_MODE in this JIRA and use LOG.debug() and LOG.trace() where needed, and (2) create a separate JIRA for adding configurable history-cleanup-time.

If you think that makes sense, I ll go ahead with it., Modified this JIRA to remove the DEBUG_MODE. Created https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-4643 to make the cleanup period configurable. , Uploading a patch for trunk that removes debug mode. I haven't added/removed any tests because there weren't any debug mode tests earlier., Uploading a patch for branch1.

TestJobHistory* have passed but for two errors in TestJobHistoryConfig. The erroneous tests had errors in branch1 also., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The changes look good to me.  Assuming Jenkins comes back OK I am a +1 on the changes for trunk.  Assuming my running the unit tests on branhc-1 come back OK I am +1 for that as well., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
