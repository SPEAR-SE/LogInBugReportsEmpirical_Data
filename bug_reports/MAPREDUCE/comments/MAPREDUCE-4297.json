This message is automatically generated., The patch makes it so truly empty lines are ignored, which is good.  

But I have a couple of comments.

 # {code}rawUgi.getLength() == 0{code} is no longer needed because it is the same as {code}rawUgi.toString().equals(""){code}
 # I am just a bit conflicted on white space and I would like your opinion on it.  An empty line is ignored but a line with a single space or a tab in it will result in a user named ' ' or '\t' which seems bad to me. Similarly a line with white space in front of or after a user name will result in exactly that a user name with white space in it.  Do we want to even try to deal with this or not?, Thanks for reviewing this Bobby!

I wasn't sure because I was thinking a byte in Text might decode to whitespace but its getLength() could possibly not be 0. But you are right! We want to ignore those cases. I've removed that condition, and trimmed the strings before comparing and assigning., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Code changes look good to me. But the  comments/javadoc and the documentation in gridmix.xml mention that each line should be of the form user[,group]*. This needs to be changed as per this patch ?, Canceling patch so we can address the latest comments., Thanks for pointing that out RaviG.
