[ 
Hadoop 23 installation on a <secure> cluster and on submitting an MR job via Oozie, we see the
following error in the NM container logs

JsonFactory.class is packaged in jackson-core-asl.jar, and versions 1.2 and above contain the aforementioned enable()
method. We are packaging Oozie with jar version jackson-core-asl-1.7.1.jar and jackson-mapper-asl-1.7.1.jar. Is there
some linking taking place to a stale version 1.0.1 of the jackson jar?

An older JIRA HADOOP-7606, mentions explicit maven dependency for this version in the pom.xml. I tried including a
similar dependency explicitly for Oozie's POM while building, but no difference.
, @John,
 Am not sure am getting why this is related to Oozie. On the same setup are you able to run any other jobs? I think this might just be a deployment issue. , Yes - I am able to run other jobs. I have a hunch as well that this might just be a deployment/setup issue, but still wanted to file a JIRA just-in-case., @John,
 I think I know what the issue might be. Let me run some experiments and post on the jira., The issue is that oozie is including a pig.jar file that picks up an older version of jackson. But what confuses me is that the pig.jar gets picked up before all the hadoop jars.
Assuming that oozie does not force USER CLASSPATHs to be picked up first, I wonder if it is wrong for App Master to include that before the default hadoop jars. 
The following is what I am seeing in the launch_container.sh script. 
{quote}
export CLASSPATH="job.jar:$PWD/*:file:/gri
{quote}
and 
{quote}
ln -sf "/grid/1/tmp/mapred-local/filecache/7267871525837532837/pig.jar" "pig.jar"
{quote}

which obviously means that pig.jar in $PWD is going to be picked up before *jackson-*.jar in the hadoop lib directory - which does not seem right.
, @John, don't know what version of Pig you are using, but 0.9.0 which is avail in the maven repo does not include 3rd party JARs. still i'm seeing that the Pig POM declares as dependency jackson 1.4.2 and those JARs are pulled into Oozie's sharelib. (Oozie trunk speaking)
, So, Pig needs to upgrade its jackson dependency for oozie to run a pig job then I guess. Either way, shouldn't the classpath have hadoop jars before the apps current directory?
{quote}
export CLASSPATH="job.jar:$PWD/*:file:/gri
{quote}, John,
 In 0.20.* series there is a specific property to add your own jars before the MR framework jars. We'll have to dig into it to see if that works or not. If that works then it might just be using htat flag to put your jars in front of the others jars., @Mahadev -I see that the launch container script has the same order in classpath when I run a wordcount using hadoop script. , John,
 Just for reference, MAPREDUCE-1938 added this property to be able to add your jars before others. Seems like in 0.23 we are doing that by default. We should maintain backwards compatibility and make sure that we load users jar later than hadoop jars unless the property is set as in MAPREDUCE-1938., @John,
 Just to confirm, the property is backwards compatible with 1.0 right?, Not sure why hudson didnt run this. Will trigger it manually., @Mahadev - the previous patch was using USER_JOB_CLASSPATH_FIRST as compared to it MAPREDUCE_JOB_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST in 1.0. Hence will upload a new patch to ensure that it is compatible with 1.0. Behavior wise, afai can tell, it is compatible. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., @john,
 One more thing I forgot to mention. In 1.0, you'd have to set:

{code}
 export HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST=true
{code}
for submit/client side to use your HADOOP_CLASS_PATH before frameworks. Does that work here as well? If not we'd have to fix that too before claiming victory on the classpath issue., Thanks for looking at this Mahadev. 
Attaching a patch with HADOOP_USER_CLASSPATH_FIRST changes as well., @John,
 Sorry to keep bringing up new issues on this but I think we need a change for fixing the task classpaths to do the same as well and obey the property (or maybe its already fixed and we just need to make sure it is). , Mahadev - verified that mapreduce.job.user.classpath.first gets propagated to both the AppM and the tasks by looking at the launch_container.sh script. , Mahadev - verified that the classpath on both the AM and tasks containers are the same by looking at the launch_container.sh CLASSPATH after passing in the mapreduce.job.user.classpath.first=true.

, Thanks John for testing it out. The patch looks good to me. Ill go ahead and commit it. , I just committed this. Thanks John!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1635 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1635/])
