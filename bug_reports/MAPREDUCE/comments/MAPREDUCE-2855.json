, Nice find Todd. These calls were taking up a good amount of time.
Attaching a patch which passes the context classloader.

For a 70MB, 11700 task history file.
ParseTime: ~4.5 seconds (remains unchanged)
Creating all Task objects: Comes down from ~11.3 seconds to ~4 seconds.
MR-3901 does defer these calls to when they're actually required.

On another note, do we really need to use ResourceBundles for the counter names, or is this something we can do away with?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

bq. On another note, do we really need to use ResourceBundles for the counter names, or is this something we can do away with?
Great question. Not even sure if anybody uses this at all. I guess we should just file a ticket and see if someone responds.
