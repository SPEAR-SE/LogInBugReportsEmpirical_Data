[The attached patch ports the sh scripting in the distribution build to Python.  It wasn't possible to use only Maven plugins (like maven-antrun-plugin with a <tar> task), because they mishandled permissions and symlinks in the built tarballs.

I tested all of the following build variations:

Windows: mvn -Pnative-win -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Mac: mvn -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Ubuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -DskipTests clean package
Ubuntu: mvn -Pnative -Pdist -Dtar -Drequire.snappy -Dbundle.snappy -Dsnappy.lib=/usr/local/lib -DskipTests clean package

This works on Windows.  Additionally, on Mac and Ubuntu, I compared the built tarballs from before and after my changes.  I confirmed that the resulting tarballs have exactly the same contents, including permissions and symlinks.
, +1 LGTM., +1. Committed the patch to branch-trunk-win. Thank you Chris.]
