[Thanks for the report. I think I am the last person touched this code. I will investigate this and fix it., It seems that the problem is the reported CPU frequency doesn't match the expected one.
This is because the CPU frequency in /proc/cpuinfo can actually change on some environment
See http://lwn.net/Articles/162548/
The test works on my dev box but not hudson this time.

The patch remove CPU frequency from the static value checking.
It will still be verified in the dynamic value checking., +1, change looks good., The output in a readable format, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Got a -1 because of no tests. Since this is a fix for the unit test, it should be OK if there's no new unit test added., Resubmitting to Hudson. Will commit it if Hudson signs OK.., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the help, Vinod. It is strange that there are many failed tests.
The patch only changes one unit tests. There is no dependency between this one and those unit tests.
I will investigate this., The failures are the usual suspects - missing common classes similar to failures in MAPREDUCE-890, MAPREDUCE-927 etc., a wierd scenario which i could never explain, and HADOOP-6528. Resubmitting to Hudson again with the hope of a test-pass this time., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
