This message is automatically generated., So, just to be sure - the patch is going to attempt commit of a task *only* for true Map/Reduce tasks. Job setup/cleanup and task cleanup all cannot rely on a commit action at all. As this is a change in semantics of tasks, I wanted to call this out specifically, though I feel this is fine. Any objections to this from anyone ?, Code changes look good. Unfortunately, I did not understand the test case fully to comment on it. I did notice though that we are testing the scenario only for task cleanup, while I suppose we do need to test for job setup and cleanup as well. I wonder if a more thorough unit test would be enabled if we refactor the logic of deciding if commit is required into a separate method and directly test that method with all types of tasks. I created such a method and some tests in the attached patch. Does this make sense ?, Amarsri and I discussed the test case in the original patch and decided to retain it as a regression test for the bug that triggered this JIRA, in addition to more targeted unit tests that I wrote.

The new patch has the following changes, in line with the above decision:
- Makes editorial changes to the regression test - adding a few more comments, refactoring for more explanatory names, etc.
- Uses a different committer for the targeted unit tests that always return true for needTaskCommit.
- Fixes TestTaskCleanup.tearDown to call super.

Amarsri, can you please take a quick look at the changes and run through Hudson ?, Changes look fine.

{noformat}, I just committed this to trunk. Thanks, Amareshwari !, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #241 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/241/])
    . Fix the M/R framework to not call commit for special tasks like job setup/cleanup and task cleanup. Contributed by Amareshwari Sriramadasu.
, An updated patch for earlier version of hadoop. Not for commit here.]
