This message is automatically generated., Since this will be fixed as part of the 0.22 blocker MAPREDUCE-2178, I'm removing from 0.22 blocker list.  Should it be closed?, Sorry to come in late, the patch has gone stale. Can you please rebase? Thanks.

Also, with LTC gone, is this still required?, Looks like there's a similar bug in MR2:
{code}
    public ShellScriptBuilder env(String key, String value) {
      line("export ", key, "=\"", value, "\"");
      return this;
    }
{code}
doesn't escape " with \"]
