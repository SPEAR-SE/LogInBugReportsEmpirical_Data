, This broke when YARN-617 was integrated., Sigh, I wish Jenkins ran these tests as part of commit. If not that, it should've run all tests and reported all failures in the nightly builds. Omkar, can you see if there is a common JIRA for this and fix it?

Also, can you run *all* MR tests? Tx., attaching patch for this.. I have create one hadoop ticket to fix jenkin and make sure it runs all the tests before commit. HADOOP-9580, I noticed that test-patch dropped the ball on both MAPREDUCE-5257 and YARN-617.  Looking at the console output during the test build, we can clearly see that the build failed yet test-patch reported an overall +1.  That's Not Good, and we would have caught these problems on YARN-617 if it was working properly.  Filed HADOOP-9583 to track the test-patch issue.

Took a quick look at the patch, seems OK for fixing just the test.  My main nit is that it would have been nice to use local variables (e.g.: host1, host2, host3) for the string constants rather than a blind search/replace since it would make the code easier on the eyes, but not something that has to be fixed.  Are there other tests that are going to have to register IP addresses rather than fake hostnames when calling rm.registerNode() to avoid a similar fate?

Also is this test failure indicating that the RM could fall over if it tries to create a token for a host for which it currently cannot lookup the hostname?  It would be unfortunate if a DNS hiccup brought down the RM on a regular basis.  I'm wondering if there's more to fix here than just the test., Discussed this with [~vinodkv] offline, and we agreed we can address the RM exiting in a separate JIRA.  Filed YARN-713.

Also looking a bit further, we saw that the use of hostnames might just work if the test simply sets SecurityUtil.setTokenServiceUseIp(false) which would be a cleaner fix., [~jlowe] completely agree this will fix the issue. (hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip) parameter is controlling ip resolution. Attaching patch., I wish I figured this config out before itself :)

The patch is fine, let's see what Jenkins says.., Actually, we shouldn't set this statically. Can you do this only for this test?, resetting it to default after test., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
