[We've seen test failures in TestJobHistoryEvents that appear to be caused by MoveIntermediateToDone threads from a previous test case interfering with files from a later test case.
, I think something simple like the following should work:

{code}

  @Override
  public void serviceStop() throws Exception {
    moveToDoneExecutor.shutdown();
    moveToDoneExecutor.awaitTermination(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    if (!moveToDoneExecutor.isTerminated()) {
      moveToDoneExecutor.shutdownNow();
      moveToDoneExecutor.awaitTermination(3, TimeUnit.SECONDS);
    }
    super.serviceStop();
  }
{code}


However, I wonder if it is a good idea to add a util class or methods in {{AbstractService}} to shutdown Runnables/Executors, so we can have a single default timeout for similar shutdowns in all services., Patch that shuts the moveToDoneExecutor down in serviceStop().
