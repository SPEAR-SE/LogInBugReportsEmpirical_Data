This message is automatically generated., [~jira.shegalov] - I'm not sure we should quietly ignore the queue-name... maybe the right fix is to ensure TestMRAppMaster actually sets a proper queue name? 

[~vinodkv] - Thoughts?, I agree with [~acmurthy] that TestMRAppMaster should set a proper queue name.
On the other note, instead of ignoring the queue name,  I think it would be a good idea to have the null check and throw an appropriate exception. What do you guys think?, I agree with you that TestMRAppMaster should set a proper queue name.
bq. I think it would be a good idea to have the null check and throw an appropriate exception.
I suggest to handle null name as "NA" by using {{getNonEmptyString}}. The method is already used for user name and job name., Attaching a patch to
# set a proper queue name when {{JobHistoryEventHandler}} instantiate {{JobIndexInfo}}.
# handle null queue name as "NA" by using {{FileIndexUtils#getNonEmptyString}}., [~jira.shegalov], I created a patch to fix this issue since this jira had not been updated for several days.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, [~ajisakaa]. Yeah, I didn't have the bandwidth to deal with this JIRA now and I was waiting for [~vinodkv] to chime in as requested by [~acmurthy]. Reassigning ..., Sorry, didn't see this before. Reviewing now.., I think the real issue is that the AM on restart after a crash-during-comment doesn't write JOB_SUBMITTED events and so queue-name/user-name etc are missing. But that's lot more changes - to emit user-name/queue-name etc as part of AM_STARTED event that is always emmited. I'll file a separate ticket for that.

The current patch seems mostly fine, except for the repeated usage of "default" strings. I'll change it to to JobConf.DEFAULT_QUEUE_NAME myself., Same patch as before but without the "default" strings.

Will commit this if Jenkins says okay., Thanks Vinod for reviewing and updating the patch!, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
