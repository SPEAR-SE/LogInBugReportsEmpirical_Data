[Preliminary patch. Fixes the issue.

Still need to:

- Add test cases for kill and various states of RMApp

- Fix the RMAppImpl to send a kill signal to RMAppAttemptImpl
, Update patch which fixes the transitions in RMApp to make sure RMAttempt is also killed.

Still pending testing and unit tests., Added more units tests for the client side plugin. Also, added tests to RM app transitions to make sure they get killed., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Mahadev, looks good overall - some minor nits:

# YARNRunner should ignore exception from ClientServiceDelegate.kill and send the 'kill' to RM anyway.
# We can remove the 'TODO' which talks abt non-existent handling of KILL in RMAppImpl
# In KillAppAndAttemptTransition, we could also make the currentAppAttempt null i.e. reset it to be safe. But we don't seem to do that anywhere else currently (app failure/completion etc.)

Unrelated - we seem to have a redundant transition for RMApp from NEW -> FAILED. We can only, ever, have SUBMITTED -> FAILED. This is because the scheduler is informed only in SUBMITTED state and then the app can be rejected. Can you pls verify and remove that transition?, Update patch after merge and adressing comments from Arun.

Addressed 1 and 2. 

For 3, currently we use currentAppAttempt for getting diagnostics info from the AM for setting status on UI, so we cant set it to null.

For the tranistion in RMApp, actually its valid. It is possible that there can be a race between an App when submitted and killed such that you can get a kill when its just new.

Also fixed the test failure introduced in MAPREDUCE-3053., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks like hudson is running tests on unpatched versions. This patch actually fixes the test case!, Looked at the patch. Some questions and comments on the approach itself.
 - With the patch, YarnRunner sends a kill to AM and also a killJob signal to RM in *all* cases. So in all the cases, AM may not be able to gracefully kill itself and write the history file. Absence of history file for all the killed jobs is a broken user experience IMHO. I think we should force-kill on the RM side only when needed.
    -- The implementation could be something like this: Check the Application state on RM, if it is running, send a kill-signal to the AM otherwise force-terminate on the RM. Sure, there are corner cases where the client obtains a non-running state, but by the time it sends a force-terminate signal, the app may become running, but losing the (little) information in those rare cases should be bearable.
 - Also jobs which are in the queue and get killed have no record in the system( ! ) (except for the fleeting cache in RM). I can't think of any solution other than MAPREDUCE-3061.
 - I am tending to rename _ClientRMProtocol.finishApplication()_ to _ClientRMProtocol.forceTerminateApplication()_ to better reflect its semantics. Thoughts?, I think most of the client commands should be fire and forget. Longer term I think the NodeManager should be sending a SIGTERM, and wait for a while before sending SIGKILL, to let AM/others do some work before getting a SIGKILL.

We always have to force terminate, I am not sure how you can get away from that. We should always be sending a KILL SIGNAL to RM, else we cannot confirm an AM is KILLED. How do you intend to enforce that an AM is dead?


, That's a little different. Cleaning up of containers(or AM)' process tree is independent and can be triggered once it is clear for the components in question that they are done with their work - via TaskUmbilicalProtocol.done() for the task and AMRMProtocol.unregister() for the AM case.

For the killed jobs, once AM gets the kill-signal, it can gracefully shut down by writing history-file, sending notification url etc, then it can proceed to deregistering with the RM. Once the deregistration comes through, the RM can then direct the NM to make sure the AM is dead., bq. Also jobs which are in the queue and get killed have no record in the system( ! ) (except for the fleeting cache in RM). I can't think of any solution other than MAPREDUCE-3061.
One idea just stuck me - we can make the JobClient write out the history-file for these jobs which are killed when idling in the queue., @Vinod, Its probably not  different but that argument is for another day :).

For the AM getting KILL signal, we can never be sure that the AM will call finishapplicationMaster. How would you enforce that? I dont think we can get away from not sending kill to the RM at *all* times. I dont think we can rely on AM to be responsive and do the right work. Thoughts?

On the renaming of the finishAPplication, I do agree we should change that.

, bq. I dont think we can get away from not sending kill to the RM at all times. I dont think we can rely on AM to be responsive and do the right work. Thoughts?
I agree with the general sentiment here. But the way I'd handle this is by having different UI for graceful-kill and force-terminate: "bin/hadoop job -kill" will do the usual graceful exit. If someone intends to do a "bin/hadoop job -kill -force", they know the risks (of not getting history file, notification etc).

In a way, we are arguing SIGTERM vs SIGKILL semantics here. Sure someone may trap SIGTERM, but SIGTERM only promises a graceful exit if the process is willing to. Otherwise, you go use SIGKILL. We don't need the framework to wrap around SIGTERM and SIGKILL., Ok, here's a compromise. We cant change the job api's to add one to force kill the job for 0.23. So in my patch, the kill command will send a kill to RM if the job is not running, if RUNNING, it will send a kill to AM and wait for 10 seconds for it to get killed. If it doesnt get killed, it will send a force kill to RM. 

Also, made a couple of other changes:

- added a little more testing
- changed the finishApplication calls to forceKillApplication in RM
- also changed the response/request names to be clear on what they are doing.

Seems reasonable?

This message is automatically generated., javadoc warning, The sleep for 10 mins is also brittle, especially for medium to big-sized jobs given we already sleep for 5 secs in MRAM before shutdown.

But I wouldn't hold that against this patch. This one clearly solves killing of apps in submitted state. Will open a separate ticket for Job.forceKill() api.

Looked at the patch myself too. Mostly lgtm.

One minor comment: Is BareBonesDispatcher same as InlineDispatcher? If so, you can promote the later to hadoop-yarn-common and drop the earlier., @vinod, thanks for the review. I have updated the patch to just use InlineDispatcher. Made changes to InlineDispatcher to suit what I wanted. Also fixed the javadoc warning., -1 overall.
