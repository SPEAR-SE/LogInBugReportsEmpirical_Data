[Here's a patch that should work. It doesn't break the existing tests, but the new test seems to fail (it is based on the Avro reflect serialization).

I think something is fundamentally wrong with the AvroReflectSerialization technique, as I haven't been able to get it to work even on a regular MR program.

I'll investigate this and perhaps if its broken, base the patch on some other custom serialization to demonstrate the fix/catch regressions., New patch that uses JavaSerialization instead to test. Test passes with this new test., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
