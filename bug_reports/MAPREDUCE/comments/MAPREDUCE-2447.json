[Setting jvmContext earlier. 
validateJvm fails if jvmContext is null.

Fixed a javadoc warning., No new test failures.
ant test-patch reports javadoc warnings - this is an already existing set of warnings (test-patch on this branch only checks for the existence of javadoc warnings), I think Arun forgot to resolve this. This has been committed to the security branch., Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was just released.]
