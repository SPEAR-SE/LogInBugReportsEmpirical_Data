[If mapred.fairscheduler.allocation.file is not set to anything, then this exception will be seen once in the logs, but scheduler should continue to function normally. You should not see any other side effects because of this.  Nige, can you confirm this?, Although it's hard to assure there were no other side effects, I was able to submit jobs., When this happens, there are no minimum shares and weights configured for pools. It is as if you had an empty allocation file. If you'd prefer to just prevent the JT from running if there's no config file, we can throw a RuntimeException., IOW, this is the equivalent behavior of *-default.xml in hadoop. Maybe the message seems a little too alarming that something was wrong. If there was no file found, then we can simply say that there was no allocation file specified and will therefore use default allocation.

Would that work ?, That sounds good.

As a separate issue, we should include at least a template for the config file in the conf directory (I think I had another JIRA on this).]
