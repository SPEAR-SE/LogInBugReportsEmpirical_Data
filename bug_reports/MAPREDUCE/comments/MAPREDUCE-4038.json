[Hi,

This JIRA is for all issues with the framework, not user code. Since {{JobQueueTaskScheduler1}} isn't a class we provide, am marking this as Invalid.

Please send your question instead to the community mailing list at mapreduce-user@hadoop.apache.org - Providing source code in your mail will also help.]
