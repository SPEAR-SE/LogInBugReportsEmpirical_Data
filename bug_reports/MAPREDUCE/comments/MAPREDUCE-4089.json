[From looking at the code for Task.  When TaskReporter.progress() is called, all it does is set the progress flag, which causes a progress update to be sent to the AM instead of a ping to be sent.  So I would guess is that we want to stop counting pings when measuring progress in the AM.  So it should probably be a simple 1 line change. , This patch addresses the timeout issue, and it does so by making ping not update progress.  It is still not completely compatible with 1.0, as in 1.0 if the timeout is set to 0 the task will never timeout.  But because this patch makes it so ping is ignored a task that has a timeout of 0, but is so locked up that it cannot ping anymore will never timeout.

I am planning to address these in a follow on JIRA, unless someone has some objections to doing so.

I also have not run all of the unit tests yet., OK Talking to people here it looks like there are a significant number of users that I know of that set the timeout to 0, so I am going to come up with a new patch to have the 0 timeout be acceptable too., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., +1 (non-binding), looks good to me., The test failures appear to be caused by either existing issues or Bind errors, just like before.  All of the failures are in the RM, which has no dependency on the code that was changed with this patch., +1 Looks good, I'll commit this shortly, Thanks Bobby!, In a sense, after this patch, we are again forcing users to set progress every so often either via a output write or an explict progress (perhaps in a separate thread). If users have to do it anyways, I don't see the purpose of the backgrounded (framework's) progress thread (that pings every three seconds).

But if it is just to be compatible, sure.

Either case, you should document the special meaning of zero timeout., I thought it would be good to leave the ping timeout in just to be sure that if someone did disable the progress timeout with a 0 we could still detect a task that has something bad with it, but I can see your point.

I updated the mapred-default.xml to include information about a value of 0.  This is also to maintain compatability with 1.0., Sorry messed that patch up a bit, trying again..., Not sure we can do anything else if we want to be compatible in this sense. Removing the ping thread completely from the framework is one option, but may be later., +1, thanks Bobby!
