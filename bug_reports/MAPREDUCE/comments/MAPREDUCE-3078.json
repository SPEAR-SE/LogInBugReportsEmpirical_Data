[It seems duplicate of MAPREDUCE-2982., bq. It seems duplicate of MAPREDUCE-2982.
Thanks for pointing it out, I close MAPREDUCE-2982 as duplicate of this ticket and MAPREDUCE-2676., Attached patch should fix this. A summary of the changes:
 - Setting and updating MR app progress as a function of progress of setup, map, reduce and cleanup tasks.
 - Using BuilderUtils to create records wherever necessary.
 - Fixed the weird type hierarchy for RMCommunicator, RMContainerRequester and RMContainerAllocator
 - Reenabling TestRMContainerAllocator and adding a test for verifying app-progress.
 - SchedulerApp change: Reversed the order of steps to first update the data-structures and then send out the event. Otherwise RMApp may poll for the new container and can get null, this bug is uncovered by the test.

Tested this on a single node also, progress updates are showing up on the RM UI., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
