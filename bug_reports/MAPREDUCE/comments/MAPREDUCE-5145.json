[Similar to YARN-542, I've drafted a patch, including the following changes:

1. Change the default value of mapreduce.am.max-attempts from 1 to 2.

2. Fix the test cases of TestStagingCleanup. Use MRJobConfig.DEFAULT_MR_AM_MAX_ATTEMPTS and assert it is larger than 1 when retry is required, while use 1 when retry is not required., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thomas/Jason, you are okay with changing this to two like the patch does?

The reasoning is that AMs run inside the cluster and so should be given an opportunity to recover from node failures by default. And having it equal to 1 defeats that goal.

Unless I hear otherwise, I'll commit this in a day or two., Yes I am fine with it being 2., Two is fine for a default for now, although I could see setting this higher to make apps more robust to node failures., I committed this to trunk and branch-2.
