[For trunk, the third party jar files are duplicated 3 times across common, hdfs, mapred. We should clean up the dependency and build structure to reduce duplications for deployment., There are also duplicated dependent jars from codes and tests (e.g the same jar will appear in both {{build/ivy/lib/hadoop-hdfs/common/}} and {{build/ivy/lib/hadoop-hdfs/test/}}).  See if you want to fix it here., Nicholas, I have a patch for hdfs in HDFS-1917.  It would be really helpful, if you can review it.  Thanks, Eric, done., Eric, with you idea, I filed HADOOP-7289.  Could you review it?, Nicholas, done., * Removed duplicated dependency for hadoop common libraries.
