This message was automatically generated., The failed test case passed in my laptop, not sure why it failed., Could anyone please help review it? Thanks., Hadoop is biased towards hostnames because
# it allows HA systems with floating IP addresses to move the host around
# Kerberos wants hostnames, not IP Addrs
# DNS and rDNS working is effectively a requirement for a functional Hadoop cluster.

With the ongoing work for IPv6 support things will get even more complex, as the address of the endpoint will depend on the protocol used.

For this reason, I think this JIRA is probably going to be a wontfix. My recommendation is to get your DNS set up so hostnames resolve, or edit /etc/hosts..

Note that the stack is coming in during the monitor phase of some MR work, so the job was submitted; its the status checks that are failing. If you start the job as a backround one, that monitoring & blocking doesn't take place ...
, Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] for the very detailed explanation. I understand it now. 

BTW: Is there any possible to make it a config option? (Of course hostname will be the default option.) Then we could avoid setting up DNS (configure a hostname for every NM) and DNS lookup if we does not need the benefits you mentioned. , Even though its now been resolved as a WONTFIX, I'll repeat a key reason: Kerberos. Most new clusters are coming up kerberized, and if people start using or relying on IP addresses things just won't work there. It's bad enough we have too many codepaths for {{isSecure()}} to have different network settings.

There are still places where Hadoop does use IPAddrs where it should be using names; this will surface in the big IPv6 support branch (which will be optional), Thanks [~stevel@apache.org] for explaining.]
