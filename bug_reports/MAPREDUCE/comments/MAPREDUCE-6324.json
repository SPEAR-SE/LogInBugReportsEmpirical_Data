[Patch that fixes two problems with the LocalContainerAllocator used for uber jobs:

# The last response ID was not being updated, so the RM was always re-sending the first response it ever sent and thus the job was never receiving an updated AMRM token
# Any updated AMRM token in the response was being ignored
, Thanks for finding this issue and posting it; this'll be helpful for anyone using Uber mode.

LGTM +1 on the change.  It seems like this might be tricky to do, but would it be possible to add a unit test?  , Thanks for the review, Robert!  Yes, this should have a unit test.  Wanted to post a version without since I was able to manually test it with an uberized Oozie launcher job and verify it fixes the issue.  I'm busy with a bunch of other stuff right now, but I'll try to take a crack at adding a unit test later this week., \\

This message was automatically generated., Looks good to me. One nit: testAllocResponseId is not really validating that responseIDs are changing?, bq. One nit: testAllocResponseId is not really validating that responseIDs are changing?

It does because it fails if LocalContainerAllocator doesn't have the patch.  The assert is in the MockScheduler class that increments the response ID with each allocate call and sends it back in the response, just like the real ApplicationMasterService.  The MockScheduler asserts that the response ID of allocate requests match the last response ID sent., Makes sense. Looks good, +1. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.7.
