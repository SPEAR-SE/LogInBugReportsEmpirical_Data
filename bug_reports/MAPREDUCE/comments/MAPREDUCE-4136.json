This message is automatically generated., A similar fix was already done for MAPREDUCE-3790.  I don't really know if this is the same fix or not, but the patch only went into trunk, and branch-0.23/branch-2.  So it might be worth looking at to see if there is some overlap between the two., Yes this is fixed with MAPREDUCE-3790, the IOException during clientOut._flush()   is now catched., \\
