[Unfortunately, we can't do it o.a.h.mapreduce.FileOutputFormat.checkOutputSpecs as done by HADOOP-4746 since the new api only gets a copy of the JobConf and not the real one, rendering the modification useless. So, the only way to fix this is to qualify the path in o.a.h.mapreduce.FileOutputCommitter., Patch for yahoo security branch, not for commit., If MAPREDUCE-3377 goes in, Arun's original comments can hold true again., The new API FOC in trunk/2.x at least already seem to be qualifying the path. There's a general test coverage as well. Given this JIRA has gone stale, am closing this out. For specific improvements, lets tackle over new JIRAs.

Thanks!]
