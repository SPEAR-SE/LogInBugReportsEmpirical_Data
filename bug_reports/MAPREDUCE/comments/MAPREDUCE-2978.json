[Note that when I ran test-patch manually it found the bug., Looking in the console, it did find the findbugs violation (
https://builds.apache.org/view/G-L/view/Hadoop/job/PreCommit-MapReduce-Build/662/console):

{noformat}
Found 1 Findbugs warnings (/home/jenkins/jenkins-slave/workspace/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient/target/findbugsXml.xml)
{noformat}

The fact it didn't report it is probably because the number in hadoop-mapreduce-project/dev-support/test-patch.properties is higher than 1. It should be changed to be zero.

I'll take a look at fixing this issue., This patch fixes the URL and the number of allowed findbugs warnings (0)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12493869/MAPREDUCE-2978.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 6 new or modified tests.

    -1 patch.  The patch command could not apply the patch.

This message is automatically generated., Forcing Jenkins to use test-patch to test changes test-patches! I must be dreaming!

Cancelling the patch to incorporate one more minor change: Jenkins prints the links to findBugs warning even when there are none., This should fix the unnecessary findBugs comments when there are no warning., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #870 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/870/])

, I committed this patch to trunk, and resubmitted MAPREDUCE-2675 to Jenkins. Left this ticket unresolved to wait for Jenkins' confirmation on one of the patches.

*It's been more than an hour since the resubmit, but Jenkins hasn't returned since.* I'm afraid I may have bombed Jenkins with this patch. If I don't give any more update my time (IST), and Jenkins still doesn't come back, this patch can be a potential suspect and offers itself for a revert., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #815 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/815/])

, bq. It's been more than an hour since the resubmit, but Jenkins hasn't returned since. I'm afraid I may have bombed Jenkins with this patch
Okay Amareshwari figured this one out by reattaching the same patch to MAPREDUCE-2979. Jenkins duly performed his duty.

She says:
bq. https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-Admin/ : see how to trigger. The combination of a Jira being in Patch Available state AND having a new attachment that has never been processed by this system is what will trigger a new test of the patch.

Something new for the day, thanks Amareshwari!

Closing this as resolved.]
