This message is automatically generated., The exact same patch also applies to trunk., Ravi - the patch looks good.

One nit - do the conversion from org.apache.hadoop.yarn.api.records.QueueState to org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.QueueState in TypeConvertor, not in org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.QueueState., @Arun: Thanks for the great suggestion! I've made the change! Uploaded patch., +1 looks good.

In general, we should avoid references to yarn apis in hadoop-mapreduce-client-core..., I just committed this. Thanks Ravi!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #925 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/925/])
