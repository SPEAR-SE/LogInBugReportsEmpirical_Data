This message is automatically generated., In some versions of {{tr}}, {{[:space:]}} only covers the space character; in others it covers vertical whitespace as well as horizontal.

The latter isn't an issue, but it looks like {{[:blank:]}} always covers spaces and tabs.  Should we use that instead?  [but it does seem unlikely that the OS name ever includes a tab]

, FWIW, Single UNIX Â® Specification, Version 2, defines these as:

space
    Define characters to be classified as white-space characters. In the POSIX locale, at a minimum, the characters space, form-feed, newline, carriage-return, tab and vertical-tab are included. In a locale definition file, no character specified for the keywords upper, lower, alpha, digit, graph or xdigit can be specified. The characters space, form-feed, newline, carriage-return, tab and vertical-tab of the portable character set, and any characters included in the class blank are automatically included in this class. 

...

blank
    Define characters to be classified as blank characters. In the POSIX locale, only the space and tab characters are included. In a locale definition file, the characters space and tab are automatically included in this class.

Of course, if people aren't following POSIX (which /usr/bin/tr on Solaris likely doesn't, but /usr/xpg4/bin/tr definitely does), then it is a bit of gamble which way you go.
