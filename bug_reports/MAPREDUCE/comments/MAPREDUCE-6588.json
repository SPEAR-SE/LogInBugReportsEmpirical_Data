[One interesting observation I made while trying to use the cross-platform macros for the MR AM as a test:

{noformat}
PATH={{PATH}};{{HADOOP_COMMON_HOME}}\bin
{noformat}

The node manager sets the following line in the batch script that launches the AM:

{noformat}
@set PATH=%PATH%;%HADOOP_COMMON_HOME%\bin
{noformat}

However, on the AM process, the PATH environment variable is as follows:

{noformat}
PATH=%PATH%;%HADOOP_COMMON_HOME%\bin;C:\hadoop\hadoop-mapreduce-project\hadoop-mapreduce-client\hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient/../../../hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/target\bin
{noformat}

While the substitution for HADOOP_COMMON_HOME is made, PATH is not. And also the original macro is preserved instead of being replaced. Maybe this is because I'm not familiar with Windows batch scripting, but this causes the existing path value to be dropped.]
