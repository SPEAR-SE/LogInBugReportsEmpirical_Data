[Talked to Giri and he mentioned that though streaming might not directly need avro, streaming depends on mapred which further depends on common->avro. This is a run time dependency and fixed when i modified src/contrib/streaming/ivy.xml to include avro dependency similar to the fix for [MAPREDUCE-859].

The same fix should go in for all related contrib projects., Being fixed at MAPREDUCE-877. Closing this as duplicate.]
