[This was introduced by the MAPREDUCE-5367 patch for different tasks to use different directories.  [~sandyr], maybe this is something you could fix quickly?  I'd be happy to review and test on Windows.

The easiest way to see the problem is to run {{TestMRWithDistributedCache}} with the following log4j.properties:

log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.mapred.LocalJobRunner=DEBUG

You'll see paths like this:

2013-08-20 16:45:02,496 DEBUG [LocalJobRunner Map Task Executor #0] mapred.LocalJobRunner (LocalJobRunner.java:setupChildMapredLocalDirs(973)) - mapreduce.cluster.local.dir for child : /tmp/hadoop-chris/mapred/local/file:/tmp/hadoop-chris/mapred/local/localRunner/chris/job_local1508712370_0001/attempt_local1508712370_0001_m_000000_0

Note the embedded "file:".  I assume the intent was really to place everything from "localRunner" down as a relative path of "/tmp/hadoop-chris/mapred/local".
, [~cnauroth], I'll take a look at this later today or tomorrow, Oh I see where I went wrong. I thought the task dirs were always placed under localJobDir (which is used for writing the job conf) and that I was reusing code by using localJobDir to construct the task path.  But they're actually actually in different places.  The localJobDir is placed relative to current working directory, while the task dirs are placed under mapreduce.cluster.local.dir.

So either should move the task dirs under localJobDir or change back the part related to task dirs.  It's not obvious to me which is better., Sandy, thanks so much for taking a look!

bq. So either should move the task dirs under localJobDir or change back the part related to task dirs. It's not obvious to me which is better.

I believe it should be the latter, because there are different assumptions about retention of files in the local job dir vs. the task attempt directories.  For example, users expect to be able to control retention of task files by setting {{mapreduce.task.files.preserve.failedtasks}} or {{mapreduce.task.files.preserve.filepattern}}.  Otherwise, they expect task attempt files to get cleaned up promptly.  (Please check my thinking on this though and let me know what you think.)
, Ok that reasoning makes sense to me.  Uploading a patch that reverts that part of MAPREDUCE-5367 that touched the task dirs., +1 for the patch.  Thanks very much, Sandy!  I've verified tests on Mac and Windows.  I'm planning on committing this later today, pending a successful Jenkins run, which I've triggered manually here:

There are no new tests, but I've confirmed that the patch fixes existing tests on Windows., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4312 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4312/])
