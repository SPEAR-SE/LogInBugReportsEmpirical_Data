This message is automatically generated., Looking into the javadoc issue., Patch looks good to me overall.

The javadoc problem perhaps is for the edits to java comments you made to ProxyUriUtils. getProxyUri() (Just in case you are still searching). Eclipse formatting suggest a bunch of tabs before 'a default path "/" can be used.'

Not related to your patch, but we don't need TestProxyUriUtils.TestAppId? Instead we can use the BuilderUtils.newApplicationId() method?

Oh, and can you please do a sanity run and verify the expected behavior? I don't have access to a cluster, so.., I updated the code to remove the usage of TestAppId, as Vinod suggested.  I could not determine what the javadoc errors were.  I rerna test-patch and looked at all javadoc erros, and none of them have anything to do with this patch.

I did run sanity tests.  I brought the WebUI up and I verified that it still showed the correct link after the state changed.  I also verified that I could get the correct link before the ApplicationMaster was up an running., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
