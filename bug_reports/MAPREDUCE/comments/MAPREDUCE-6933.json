[This bug was fixed back in 0.23.3 by MAPREDUCE-3932.  Looks like it regressed and it was fixed again by MAPREDUCE-5409 in 2.3.0.  See the FAILED_KILLED_STATE_IGNORED_EVENTS EnumSet in TaskAttemptImpl.

0.23.1 is a very old release even within the Hadoop 0.23 line, having been released over 5 years ago.  I highly recommend you update to the latest 2.6 or 2.7 releases which contain numerous fixes since 0.23.  If for some reason you cannot upgrade to a 2.x line yet I would highly recommend upgrading to the latest 0.23 release, 0.23.11.]
