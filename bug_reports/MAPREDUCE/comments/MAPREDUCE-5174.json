[I assume that the total maps and total reduces you are talking about is on the main page of the history server, and not on the job specific page.  This is because the REST API you listed and the main page both get their information from the names of the history files themselves.  So this is likely to be something to do with the metrics that are used when creating the history file name in the AM.  If you are also talking about the page that is specific to the job then there is something more deeply wrong, and some of the history events are likely being lost, or we are parsing the history file incorrectly., bq.I assume that the total maps and total reduces you are talking about is on the main page of the history server, and not on the job specific page. 

Yes, I see the problem in the main page of JHS UI and REST API for job list, I don't see any problem in job specific page and REST API for specific job.]
