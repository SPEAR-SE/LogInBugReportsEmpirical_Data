[I suspect Hive, Pig, etc will have the same issues. I'd prefer to not peek/poke private fields via reflection and would like to see the api support Configuration directly.

It could also be argued the static accessors should only know about Configuration and nothing about Job, JobContext, etc types since it's there business to set properties on the Configuration object.

I'm happy to submit a patch that mirrors all the accessors but accepts Configuration. the current methods can be deprecated, or not. but would be cleaner if they were removed at some point., Sorry, I haven't bothered with a patch for this as there hasn't been any public comment.

In the meantime I've brute forced around this issue throughout my code. It would be much cleaner if there weren't the random new Job() or new TaskAttemptContext() strewn about.

One concern here is that a new Job() invokes a new Configuration() to wrap the given Configuration default values. 

In previous Hadoop releases, instantiating a JobConf in a task has been known to freeze a child jvm during the xml parsing (no idea what caused this for users).

There being a static block in Configuration for loading resources, I am unsure how this will play out., Ping!

It'd be good to get an update on this one to see if the problem persists.  Probably a stale issue?]
