[I am wondering if this needs to be updated from info to debug level. The rest of the output in this function is printed as "System.out.println" so perhaps this logging at Info level is fine? , Yes, I agree. This might be a low priority one. It seems that scanForSpeculations() is only called by TestRuntimeEstimators.java. However, for a related issue: I am wondering if System.out.println here should be changed to LOG.DEBUG?
, I also agree that the System.out.println calls could be replaced by LOG.debug calls, as well as the LOG.info call. I can generate a patch for this issue if this solution is ok. Can I do it from the most recent released version (3.0.0-beta1) ?, [~gribeler] Hi, I have no problems with that. Thanks for your effort!, GitHub user ggribeler opened a pull request:
