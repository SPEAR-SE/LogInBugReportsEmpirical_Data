[Patch for y20.200 branch. Trunk doesn't seem to need the patch due to MAPREDUCE-1152, where killed tasks don't cause waiting tasks to be incremented., v2 patch uses a more stable method to check for metrics garbage-collectedness., This seems to be in 1.X/0.20.2XX already? 

However, I'm not sure how the patch is related to "Waiting" metrics.  This only touches failedMap&failedReduce metrics., bq. However, I'm not sure how the patch is related to "Waiting" metrics. This only touches failedMap&failedReduce metrics.

Please ignore this comment.  I now see that metrics.failedMap()/failedReduce() calls updates the waiting metrics inside.
So we can close this as fixed/committed? 
(Although we are still seeing incorrect metrics reported in MAPREDUCE-1238), Yes, Koji is right, this patch was integrated into branch-1/20s in revision  1077665 (branches/branch-1.0/src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/JobInProgress.java) - which according to changes.txt would have went into 0.20.202.0.

Moving this to resolved and can fix issue under MAPREDUCE-1238.]
