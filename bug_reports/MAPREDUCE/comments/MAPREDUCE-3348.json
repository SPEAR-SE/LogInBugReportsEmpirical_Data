This message is automatically generated., I don't like the fact that we have to rely on ApplicationReport being null, but can live with it for now. We should add different exceptions like NotFoundException, AccessControlException which we can then use for app, queue, node etc.

Looks good otherwise. Couple of minor nit:
 - Please add a comment to ClientRMService.getApplicationReport() when we return with null report. Also, clarify the same thing by adding a javadoc for this method.
 - Can you also change the two log statements "Could not get Job info from RM for job ..." in ClientServiceDelegate to INFO?, Created MAPREDUCE-3865 for throwing different exceptions., Thanks Vinod for taking a look into the patch. I have addressed the comments in the updated patch.
