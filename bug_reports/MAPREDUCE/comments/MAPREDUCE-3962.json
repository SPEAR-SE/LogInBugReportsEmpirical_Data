[Hi Saad,

If you don't specify FileInputFormat explicitly, then It uses TextInputFormat as defalut. In this case, map input key will be LongWritable and Value will be Text.

And also you need to set MapOutputKeyClass, MapOutputValueClass, OutPutKeyClass and OutPutValueClass.

Please take care of above ponits and run the job. 

If you can run the job successfully, then please close this issue as invalid.
