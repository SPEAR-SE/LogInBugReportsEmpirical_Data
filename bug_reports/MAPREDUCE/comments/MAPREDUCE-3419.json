[The change to MiniMRCluster to clean up exited TTs threads is actually somewhat invasive so let's just revert the setting of isDead from MR-2850 and add a field that flags what TestDiskFailures would like to check, which is that the TT exited cleanly., Patch looks good to me.

Hope you ran all tests that were failing earlier., Thanks Ravi. Yea, this fixes the other tets. I'll re-run the whole suite on branch-20-security for sanity before committing., All tests ran cleanly except for one, which is unrelated, filed HADOOP-7836 for it.  I've committed this.
