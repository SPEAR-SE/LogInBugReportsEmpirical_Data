[Adding output 

{code}

{code}

*"type":"reduceTaskAttemptInfo"*
*"type":"REDUCE"*
, {{JAXBContextResolver}} context is set as below

{code}
    this.context =
        new JSONJAXBContext(JSONConfiguration.natural()
        .rootUnwrapping(false).build(), cTypes);
{code}

xml out put for the same

{noformat}
<taskAttempts>
<taskAttempt xsi:type="reduceTaskAttemptInfo">
<startTime>1439172535485</startTime>
..
<type>REDUCE</type>
</taskAttempt>
</taskAttempts>
{noformat}

While converting to JSON *xsi:type="reduceTaskAttemptInfo"* type gets added to taskattempt.
fix could be 

{code}
    this.context =
        new JSONJAXBContext(JSONConfiguration.mapped()
        .rootUnwrapping(false).build(), cTypes);
{code}
but the json format will differ. 

 or {{ReduceTaskAttemptInfo}} shouldnt be an extended class
[~devaraj.k] any thoughts?, [~zxu] any thoughts on this issue ?, Hi [~bibinchundatt]

Thanks for reporting issue and analysis. You are right, the two *type* is ofcourse confusing unless someone knows the implementation details because *type* usually refers to datatype in json (*"type":"reduceTaskAttemptInfo"* is right) . I suggest we can change the name of *org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.webapp.dao.TaskAttemptInfo.type*. Ofcourse a incompatible change, It looks like app master web service url http://<am_ip>:<am_port>/ws/v1/mapreduce/jobs/{jobid}/tasks/{taskid}/attempts also has this issue. Yes, it will be an incompatible change to fix this issue. it will be better to fix it at 3.0.0., Yes, it looks like a good suggestion to avoid name conflict with reserved keywords., Hi [~zxu] and [~ajithshetty] 

Thank you for looking into the issue.I totally agree for the same. 
Any recommendation for key.Instead of *type* can we change to *mrtype*?, Maybe change the name {{type}} to {{taskType}} because it came from {{TaskType.toString()}}, agree with [~zxu] suggestion, Hi all, we faced the same problem and I created separated ticket MAPREDUCE-7133 (did not see thisÂ ticket before). We can rename the property in TaskAttemptInfo but as you said this is the incompatible change. Perhaps, we can to fix the main cause of the problem and save backward compatibility.

Could someone evaluate the solution and review the patch attached to MAPREDUCE-7133?

Thanks a lot for any comments.]
