Another aspect of this issue.
Task failed on those 3 trackers because they have too little memory.
Hadoop scheduler correctly detected that fact, and correctly determined that each of those trackers has the capacity of one slot.
Thus, the cluster has the total capacity of 53 closts (10 * 5 + 3 * 1).
However, the scheduler did not use that information when computing the maximum number of tasks each tracker can take for the job, and thought each task tracker should take 4 tasks, regardless of their actual capacity.

 , Runping, did the pending tasks finally run when the other reducers completed or they remained in the PENDING state for ever ?, 
the pending tasks finally got scheduled., Closing this as stale.]
