[This is because of the *stale* object returned from the *loadedJobCache*.

When I tried to access the job config first time, when job history files were present in the intermediate directory, as *loadedJobCache* does not contain any entries to fulfill the request, CompletedJob object was created and has been added to *loadedJobCache* and the same object has been returned. However when I tried to access the same job config again, this time job history files were present in the done directory, as *loadedJobCache* already contained the job entry, *loadedJobCache* returned the job object from its cache. So the returned job object's confFile path pointing to *intermediate* directory where as the job's actual confFile is present inside done directory and hence the exception., I saw this same issue while working on MAPREDUCE-3972, and I fixed it as part of that JIRA.  I did this because I considered it a threading issue.  The move from done_intermediate to done was not coordinated with the reading of the Configuration file. It also was not coordinated with reading the jhist file or many other things.]
