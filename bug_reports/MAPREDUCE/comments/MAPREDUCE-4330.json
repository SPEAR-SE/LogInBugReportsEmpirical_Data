[The patch fixed 2 issues
If the TaskAttemptCompletionEvent is fired twice for same job task attempt and 
1) if the first attempt is SUCCESSFUL and second attempt is anything other than SUCCESSFUL then earlier SUCCESSFUL attempt's state is changed to OBSOLETE.
2) if the first attempt is SUCCESSFUL and second attempt too is SUCCESSFUL then it marks the first attempt as OBSOLETE and updates the task's successful attempt to the second one.
, Both the issues are fixed., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Omkar, the code change to JobImpl itself looks good.
The unit test needs some changes though, mostly minor.
- Don't think the CommitterEventHandler really needs to be setup.
- A mockito mock of TaskImpl will likely be simpler.
Patch needs formatting fixes., bq. Omkar, the code change to JobImpl itself looks good.
Looking at this a little more, JobImpl needs some changes as well. What's happening rightnow is that multiple SUCCEEDED events can make it into the CompleteEventList. Only the latest will be remembered as the successful event for a task. While Shuffle can handle this, if one of the forgotten attempts fails - it's status will not be updated in the list, and subsequent shuffle attempts could see failures.
We can either choose to remember multiple successful attempts per task id and leave all successful events in the main list, or maintain a backup list for additional successful events - which can be used on failure of the previous successful attempt., I think it's best to keep track of a single completion event. Re-launch the task if this one happens to fail. That remains closer to the current logic where only a single completion event is remembered per task - and is likely less complicated., Fixing all the comments. Making sure that only first successful event is remembered for the corresponding task until it fails., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
