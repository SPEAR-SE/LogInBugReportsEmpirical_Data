[I was already looking into this when I was working on a different issue, so I figure I should just grab this one., This patch copies a bit more code then is really necessary to make the change.

# Tests a la TestAMWebApp would be good, as I also mentioned in MAPREDUCE-2676.
# Inconsistent @Override usage in HsAppController.
# HsCounterPage seems unnecessary.













, Sorry about not responding sooner, I have been on vacation.  I will update the patch ASAP.

The HsCountersPage is needed to change active:2 to active:1 in the nav, also it needs to inherit from HsView not AppView in order for it to get the new Nav., Upmerged to latest code, and added in some tests., rebasing changes on trunk after MR-279 was merged to trunk., Patch has been updated to work off of trunk after MR-279 was merged to trunk., -1 overall.

 There is an open jira for javadoc warnings (MAPREDUCE-2886), but last I checked we had 73 warnings. Could be the last few checkins that added more of them?, I have no idea where the javadoc warnings are coming from.  When I run the command manually I get

My changes are limited to hadoop-mapreduce-client-hs and hadoop-mapreduce-client-app both of which have 0 findbugs warnings in them.

, +1 the patch looks good to me. One minor nit, could we add some javadocs/comments to some of the classes (atleast the new ones)? , Sure, I was going off of what was there before, mostly copy and paste from the ApplicationMaster UI, but I will be happy to add in Javadocs and some comments to the new classes., Added in some javadocs to the code that I changed., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The test error looks like it is unrelated to anything that I have done.  The find bugs warnings also look spurious., Bobby, I just tried out the patch. The new HsNavBlock isn't being used on the history page. After updating HsView to use HsNavBlock - 1 minor issue.
The About link doesn't exist any more. It'd be useful to have this page with the version of the history server. In the interest of getting the other HS UI jiras (2672-2676) committed - this could be left as an under construction page with a Jira to fix it.
Also, this doesn't necessarily need to be part of this patch, but since separate Hs pages are created by this - HsController and HistoryContext don't necessarily need to extend AppController and AppContext., You are right. I do not know how I missed that.  I think it must have been a merge issue or something, because I tested it before submitting the patch the first time.  I can add in an about page without too much work.  HsController and HistroyContext still need to extend AppController and AppContext until the UI is completely separate.  There are still pages that are coming from the ApplicationMaster UI.  But I will look into doing that for MR-2675., Upmerged, added in about page, fixed HsNav issue, added in work around to MAPREDUCE-2927 so that other pages can be viewed., -1 overall.
