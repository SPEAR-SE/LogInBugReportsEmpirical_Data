This message is automatically generated., I just verified this patch on a single node secure setup. Without the patch, I can reproduce the problem, while with it the issue is gone. That's the verification part.

I looked at the patch too, looks good, except for one minor point. YARN is the default framework now, as is documented in mapred-default.xml. Can we change the code to reflect the same? Thanks., Thanks for the verification, Vinod. 

bq. I looked at the patch too, looks good, except for one minor point. YARN is the default framework now, as is documented in mapred-default.xml. Can we change the code to reflect the same? Thanks.

Regarding the defaulting to yarn, there are a couple of places where it defaults to classic hence the patch above ( one of these was a change I had submitted a patch for earlier ). Will look through the ones which are not part of the legacy code ( i.e. hadoop-mapreduce-project/src) and change those to make yarn as the default. , Addressed code review comments. Also added a minor change in ReduceTask to default to yarn., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
