[Another note: The newer implementations of multifilewordcount in mapreduce.* that dont provide a RecordReader.getPos() implementation don't have this problem.   

So this really is related also to support for the multifilewordcount class.  

With new filesystem implementations which mapreduce can work on top of, it is important to define the expected semantics of getPos() for FSInputStreams.
