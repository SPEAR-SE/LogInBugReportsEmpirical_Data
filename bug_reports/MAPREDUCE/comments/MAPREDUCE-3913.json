[Problem may have been introduced with MAPREDUCE-3754.  Ajax data URL was designated as cluster/apps/json but anything after cluster/apps/ is interpreted as an application state.

Not sure the Ajax support is useful anymore, as the app table always is sorted on the client and therefore the client always grabs all the data from the server.  Seems like we could just drop the Ajax loading support and leverage the existing JS_ARRAY rendering and end up with the same thing., Patch to remove the Ajax table loading per previous comment and fix the manual RMWebApp tests.  Ran the manual test to verify the apps page with 10500 jobs rendered properly., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
