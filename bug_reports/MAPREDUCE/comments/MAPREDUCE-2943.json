[I just looked at {{LocalJobRunner}} assuming it can be taken out of MRV1 into one of the MRV2 modules. But turns out it is pretty wired into MRV1 stuff, DistributedCache and all.

So for now, I guess we should just wait for HADOOP-7590 and use the MRV1 artifact.

It is a pity that DistCpV2 has to depend on the old artifacts just for this. Guess we can use this ticket for making a version of local-job-runner that works with YARN., With MAPREDUCE-3237, LocalJobRunner has now been moved into hadoop-mapreduce-client-common.]
