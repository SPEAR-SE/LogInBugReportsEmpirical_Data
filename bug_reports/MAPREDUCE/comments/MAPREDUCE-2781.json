[Thomas, 
 Would it be possible to add a unit test, that includes unit tests to make sure all the application finish time/start time/diagnostics and other are set? We can do it in a separate jira as well. , Sorry, looks like I forgot to hit enter with my comment last night.  I was actually planning on adding some and want to do a bit more validation on all the kill transitions. Posted the patch in case anyone wanted to take an initial look at it. Thanks., startTime was also not being set, fixed that.  start time is actually more like submit time. Might be nice to add some finer grain times in there for atleast submit, launch.  I also don't think each attempt is tracking its start/finish time so those would be nice enhancements., patch with various small fixes and unit tests., +1 lgtm, I just pushed this. Thanks Thomas!]
