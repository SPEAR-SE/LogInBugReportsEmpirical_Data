[Runping, Can you attach JobTracker log and one of stuck reducer log?, 
The below is the relevant part from the job tracker:

Note that the last line above saying that task_200811070042_0002_r_000009_0 was completed, but it was failed actually.

, Runping, Is the log you pasted is for a running reducer or  is it for a failed/completed one?

bq. All mapper tasks completed. 17 reducer tasks completed. 11 reducers are still in the running state and one is in the oending state and stay there forever.
Out of 38 reducers, you gave the state of 29 reducers here. what happened to the other 9 reducers? Are they not shown in the UI at all?, 
20 reducers completed
17 are still in running state (stuck)
One (task_200811070042_0002_r_000009_) is  in the pending state

, This has gone stale, and has not been reported again recently. Was probably fixed at some point.]
