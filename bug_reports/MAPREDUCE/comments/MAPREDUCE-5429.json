[How big was your job?  Do you have a heap dump?, How did you configure AppMaster's heap memory(yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts)?, Cluster has 1 ResourceManager, 4 NodeManager running in 8CPU machines.
Each NodeManager has 16Gb capacity configured.

Job Details : 
It is example job i.e "teragen" job with more than 5K task., All default congifuration used i.e yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts="-Xmx1024m"

For the first time when job is run, heap dump could not able to take :-(.  Again trying to reproduce the issue with same job running on the cluster., I believe this is expected. You need to give your AM more memory if its running a lot of tasks. I would tend to close this JIRA as invalid, I will try to get heap dump and gc logs for app master memory usage., [~raviprak] yeah looks like configuration issue..
<property>
  <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.resource.mb</name>
  <value>1536</value>
  <description>The amount of memory the MR AppMaster needs.</description>
</property>
what is the value set here?
was that a long running job? how many containers? how big is the cluster? is there a possible memory leak somewhere? heap dump will help., Closing the issue since problem was with am memory configuration. After increasing memory to 5GB, it worked well.
Thanks all who looked into this issue and for their suggestions.]
