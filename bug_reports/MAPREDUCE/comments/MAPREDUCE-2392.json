[This is reminiscent of HADOOP-5380, except in this case it is the TT-JT communication that is timing out.

The problem is that calling interrupt() on the TaskTracker thread can (by chance) cause it to interrupt the heartbeat RPC call, which then takes 60 seconds to timeout ("ipc.ping.interval") from readInt() in org.apache.hadoop.ipc.Client$Connection.receiveResponse.

This can be fixed by removing the interrupt call to the TaskTracker, since we already call shutdown() on the TaskTracker then join() on the thread running it., This might be fixed by HADOOP-6762. Even if it does, we might still use this patch since there is no need to call shutdown() and interrupt() from tests., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
