This message is automatically generated., There are no tests since it is a change to the build system. To manually test I created a tarball, then built another one from it. I'd like to commit this in the next day or two, barring objections., +1 patch looks good. There are some long lines in the patch but they are replacing equally long lines in the original code, so I think it is ok., I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
