This message is automatically generated., Quick comments on the patch:
 - Change ClientService to extend Service. That way you don't need the type-casting in MRAppMaster.
 - The start of client-service in MRAppMaster.serviceStart() should not be under the condition for errorHappenedShutDown.
 - Fix formatting in the changes done for MRApp.java
 - Can you move the checks for JobHistoryEventHandler and ClientService into a stand-alone test say TestMRAppComponentDependencies or something similar? They don't belong to the staging-cleanup test., upload a new patch that fix the comments.
Still keep client-service under the condition for errorHappenedShutDown as the client-service is not inited if errorHappenedShutDown is true. Also add a comment there., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good except for the point that you unnecessarily made ClientService an abstract class. ClientService can simply extend Service and still be an interface., New patch fixed the comment, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, Does the client service return job succeeded status after the services have stopped or as soon as jobimpl succeeds? If we wait till after the services have stopped, then we can be sure that the user will be notified of success only when the job is really done. Any unexpected incident during unregister etc can be handled internally as appropriate because the user still thinks that the job is running. After that we can sleep for 5 secs for the user to connect and read the status., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #329 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/329/])
