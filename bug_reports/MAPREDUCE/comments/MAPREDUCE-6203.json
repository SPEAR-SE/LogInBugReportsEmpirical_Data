[HI huangyitian,

Turning on log aggregation allows users to easily store container logs in HDFS and subsequently view them in the YARN web UIs from a central place.

If  *yarn.log-aggregation-enable*  is disabled try looking for the logs under each nodemanager that ran the tasks. 
The location for this local dir is configured as property  *yarn.nodemanager.log-dirs*  in yarn-site.xml

SO if you want to view from JHS and YARN Web UI then enable log aggregation.., Closing this issue(please check above comments)..If you feel, there is a issue, you can reopen this jira..]
