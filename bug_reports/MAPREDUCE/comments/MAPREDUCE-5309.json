[This is an issue even when parsing Job History Logs generated in Hadoop 0.23.9.10
Viraj, Changed the order of counters field in Events.avpr , This fix the history files that were generated before 2.4.0 but breaks the history files that are generated since 2.4.0., Rushabh thanks for your help in fixing this Jira

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for the patch, Rushabh!  Some comments:

- Findbugs warning needs to be addressed.
- To match existing parsing behavior for missing fields strings should default to null rather than an empty string.  The difference is subtle and could cause subtle bugs, so we should match existing behavior here.  I think that means we need to have them be of type \["null", "string"\] and "default": null.
- If the task info or attempt info is null we should log a warning since something is wrong with the history file.
- In the test cases we don't need to catch the IOException and translate to YarnException, we can just let the IOException bubble up and fail the test directly.
- The test of the three separate jhist files should ideally be three separate unit tests.  There's basically no common setup, and that way when a test fails the test name immediately conveys which version of the history is failing to parse., Jason, 
Thanks for reviewing my patch.

This message is automatically generated., Haven't looked very carefully, but scanned through the patch and it seems reasonable. Can you post a summary of what the patch does for posterity? Tx., Current patch has a typo in one of the log statements., Initially EventReader#reader was initialized like:
this.reader = new SpecificDatumReader(schema, schema);
This assumed the reader schema and writer schema is the same.
But when the schema was upgraded from 2.0.3 to 2.0.4, new fields were added in 2.0.4 which were not present in 2.0.3. When the parser tried to parse 2.0.3 logs (which doesn't have the new fields), the parser returned with errors.
So basically we need to differentiate between the new schema and the schema of the input jhist files and avro will do the rest of the mapping by field name.
For the fields that were recently added, we need to assign the default values. So in case if we are parsing the old schema jhist files, it will assign the default value.
[~vinodkv]: I hope this helps.
[~viraj]: Yes, this patch will parse both 0.23.x and 2.4.x logs., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
