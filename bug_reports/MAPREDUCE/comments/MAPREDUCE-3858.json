This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good. Thanks Tom for the patch., +1 (non-binding.) I tested this patch on a cluster over night and didn't experience this issue at all, whereas without this patch I hit this problem twice in a 12 hour period under the same load., Good patch to go into 0.23.1 as well. Ill go ahead and commit this to all the 3 branches., I just committed to all 3 branches 0.23.1, 0.23 and trunk. Thanks Tom!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1727 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1727/])
