[[~tucu00] Can you please take a look at this? Seems related to YARN-787. Tx!, On it. It seems it broke with MAPREDUCE-5310, test-patch did not detect it as it did not run those tests., MAPREDUCE-5310 stopped setting the MIN in the local clusterinfo. That is why the tests were failing, because the slot-millis calculation was querying the MIN from the local clusterinfo.

YARN-787 removed the MIN from cluster info and wired the MIN from configuration for the calculation of slot-millis. 

So, YARN-787 fixed what MAPREDUCE-5310 broke.

I've just run those tests on the head of trunk and 2.1-beta and they are passing.

Closing this one as invalid]
