[
Here's roughly the offending code:

{code}
getLocalizeCache(URI uri) {
   localizeCache();

   if(currentDiskUsage > conf.get(mapreduce.tasktracker.cache.local.size)) {
      deleteOldFilesInCache();
   }
}
{code}

So, when mapreduce.tasktracker.cache.local.size is hit, localization of a task will not complete _till_ the deleltion of (possibly a large number of) old DistributedCache files is completed (which can possibly take long time).

Localization of a task should not ideally be blocked on cleanup of old files. Clean-up can best be done in a separate thread., MAPREDUCE-1302 already started implementation for this issue. Closing this as duplicate.]
