[This is mostly a timing issue and happens when memory manager tries to destroy a process that is just gone. It didn't affect the testcase. The memory manager code doesn't propagate failures across its processing of multiple tasks. The side-effects seem to be mostly negligible. As we try to remove a task entry from the processTreeInfoMap map only after destroy succeeds. I think a task entry will be left in the map, but as we enough null checks in place, this process will just be skipped in further iterations., Even though the session leader is gone, the child processes in that session can still be there and they need to be killed., Attaching patch that fixes the issue.

Please review and provide your comments., Few comments:
 - HADOOP-6230 is already committed, we need a new patch that applies to mapred project for this issue.
 - I think it shouldn't be very difficult to directly test assertAndDestroyProcessGroup()/assertPidPgrpidForMatch()
by using the concept mock processes which is already being used in TestProcfsBasedProcessTree.
 - Minor:
    -- Fix the new comments/log statements introduced in this patch. They can be bettered/made more correct.
    -- Wrap around lines longer than 80 characters.

I've corrected the patch myself w.r.t HADOOP-6230 and can confirm that the NPE messages no longer appear in
TestTaskTrackerMemoryManager with this patch., Attaching patch for MapReduce and added testcase.

This message is automatically generated., Apologies for looking at this late. The patch looks fine overall. One minor nit is that the test case testDestroyProcessTree is initializing an array procInfos without any need for it. Can this be removed and run through Hudson again - so I can commit it ?, Attaching patch by removing the unnecessary array., Allowing to go through Hudson...., +1 overall.
