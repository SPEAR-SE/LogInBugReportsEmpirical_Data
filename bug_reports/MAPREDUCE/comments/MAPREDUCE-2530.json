[There doesn't seem to be a fix for this (atleast in jetty 6), perhaps we can workaround it by adding a "ping" type servlet to TT and having the health checker script ping it and report it if it isn't responding., This might be the same issue as MAPREDUCE-2386., yea, I think it is. It's all due to the same underlying JVM bug, as far as I can tell. Can we close this one as duplicate and continue discussion on the other ticket?, Yes, I marked it as duplicate, but that apparently doesn't close it.  Please go ahead and close.]
