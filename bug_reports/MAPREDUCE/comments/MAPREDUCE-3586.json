{code}, I've spent enough time, but still not sure why this is happening only in PIG testing and not on my local unit testing or the cluster testing we've been doing.

Regardless, there is a stop-gap solution: Making the stop() of CompositeService reentrant so that components are only stopped once. Once we do that, we can prevent this issue of two threads waiting to join on each other completely., Simple patch to avoid duplicate stop., +1, +1 overall.
