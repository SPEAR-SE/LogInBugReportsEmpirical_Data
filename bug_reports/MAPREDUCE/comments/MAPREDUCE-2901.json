[On my Ubuntu desktop (11.04) protobuf-compiler package (2.3.0-4ubuntu2) is installed and protoc is on the command line.
I still get the error.

http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/DevelopingOnTrunkAfter279Merge advices to add non-standard installation directory to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
However, the libprotoc6 package has already put libprotoc.so.6 and libprotoc.so.6.0.0 in /usr/lib/. Seems like a standard path to me.

It seems to me that simply checking whether protoc is in the path will not be sufficient., hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/README reads that we need to install protobuf 2.4.0a or higher.
Does that mean that on my Ubuntu machine I should uninstall the deb packages listed in my previous comment and configure/make/install from scratch?, I think we can we can check for protoc.exe file in the classpath, instead., bq. Does that mean that on my Ubuntu machine I should uninstall the deb packages listed in my previous comment and configure/make/install from scratch?
Yes Joep, that is what I had to do on my Ubuntu box. Watch out, the compilation of the proto takes quite some time.

Also, can you please paste the error you got with the 2.3 version? I'd like to get it added to the wiki page. Thanks!, Ubuntu 11.04 comes with ProtoBuf 2.3.0, which gave me the below error while compiling yarn.

yarn_protos.proto:4:8: Option "java_generate_equals_and_hash" unknown.

/usr/bin/protoc --version
libprotoc 2.3.0

/home/praveensripati/Installations/protobuf-2.4.1/src/protoc --version
libprotoc 2.4.1, Yeah, that is the same error I see with libprotoc 2.3.0:

, After configure make install of protoc the yarn build came through clean.
In my case I uninstalled libprotoc through the synaptic UI.
The default ./configure step did not work and resulted in the following error when running protoc --version:
protoc: error while loading shared libraries: libprotobuf.so.7: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

I did a make unintall, make distclean, ./configure --prefix /usr, make, make install
and then things worked fine.]
