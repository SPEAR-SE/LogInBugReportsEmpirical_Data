Running org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.TestRMContainerAllocator, Test failure on MAPREDUCE-5517 is not related to the code changes. Those failure are from other tests as well. Can anyone review this ?, The patch looks good to me other than a few stylistic nits:
{code}

This message is automatically generated., Few more nits:
 - Fix lines longer than 80 chars
 - Make the same changes w.r.t cpu configuration too?
 - The conditional code has become a bit complex. Rewrite using simple if..else statements? Also create local variables for values of MAP_MEMORY_MB etc instead of repeated config lookups?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
