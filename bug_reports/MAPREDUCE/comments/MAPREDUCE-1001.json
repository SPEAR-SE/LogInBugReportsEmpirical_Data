[Hong's maintenance concerns have been borne out; here's my comment from (duplicate) MAPREDUCE-2024:

bq. The fifth JobTracker constructor (JobTracker(final JobConf conf, Clock clock, boolean ignoredForSimulation)) still uses the old "mapred.*" config settings and appears to duplicate much of the code in the fourth (main) ctor. It should be modernized and, ideally, share as much code as possible with the main one in order to minimize simulation drift and the potential for config errors.

(In case it's not clear, the other constructor has already been modified to use the newer "mapreduce.*" config settings.  Thus the config settings that work for one will have no effect on the other unless they're manually duplicated.), +1 for fixing it!, Mumak has been removed from Hadoop.]
