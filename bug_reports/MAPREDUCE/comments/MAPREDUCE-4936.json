[My bad - I'm pretty sure these passed when I ran it initially. IAC, I'll fix this. Thanks for pointing it out Daryn., Fixed the cpu check to not bork TestUberAM.

I've also fixed it to use not use hard-coded default, but it's systemic and I've opened MAPREDUCE-4943 to fix other instances since I'm looking to unblock 2.0.3-alpha for now.
