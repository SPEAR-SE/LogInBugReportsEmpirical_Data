[I think you just need to update your checkout of HDFS trunk. This method was added in HDFS-1399., That is probably it. But the jar downloaded by ivy does not have it., It just worked for me. I ran the following, and it compiled just fine:

{code}ant veryclean compile-mapred-test{code}, The compile succeeded without doing ant veryclean. Not sure what the problem was.]
