[The following is a unit test I wrote on the hadoop-lzo side that does the same behavior as IFile.Reader.close():

https://github.com/toddlipcon/hadoop-lzo/commit/a5af3b93f52f55828dfc05e7503d38383eec9dc5

It fails reliably since some threads only manage to read part of the data in the file., Such pattern would in general affect all CompressionCodec's and is similar to a bug I filed earlier: HADOOP-4195.

On the other hand, as explained by Chris D in HADOOP-4162, LzopCodec cannot be safely reused in Hadoop, and thus the problem you described actually should not happen. In fact, repeatedly getting LzopCodec from CodecPool is likely get you into OOM., Hong: I agree LzoCodec is preferable to LzopCodec for use in intermediate compression, but I think the bug you referenced is no longer the case. LzopCodecs can now be pooled properly with Chris's patch you referenced plus changes on the lzo side.

Just to clarify, you agree this code in IFile is wrong and should be fixed, right?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
