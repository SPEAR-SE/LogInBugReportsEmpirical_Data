[Sorry, we can't rename it for compatibility reasons. We could deprecate it for 3.x and remove it 4.x.

Also, can you please consolidate jiras for javadocs? This way we don't proliferate jiras and miss important ones. Tx., I agree. I was thinking about it. I will change the summary. I was thinking about consolidation of bugs as well but created them separately to allow different assignees to work on the different bugs. But I do agree that it will result in bug proliferation. It appears that priority is of reduction of proliferation. I will consolidate. If the bugs need to be assigned to different people, I presume the primary assignee will take care., duplicate of 5342]
