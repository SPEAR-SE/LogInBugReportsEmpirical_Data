[it looks like the conf() function was remove from HsController but HsWebApp is still expecting it there., putting the conf routine back allows history server to start., It looks like hscontroller extends appcontroller and conf() was added there so I think the intention was for it to pick up that version., It looks to me like Router.java is using reflection incorrectly and not checking whether the method was inherited.  It's manually throwing that exception if the method is not found in that class., It looks like I caused this by removing the method.  I think the correct solution is to fix the addController method in Router.java so it does the reflection correctly though - rather than adding the method back in to the HsController since it already inherits it.  addController currently does not look at inherited methods.  Additionally, it seems like we could just do a getMethod and get rid of the loop through all the methods to get better speed/efficiency/clarity., I'm still testing this a bit.  The jobs are passing, and the historyserver is running fine, but I'm seeing this log message repeatedly:
11/09/19 20:00:26 INFO mapred.ClientCache: HistoryServer is not configured., It looks like the INFO message is caused by the change with MAPREDUCE-2925 and unrelated to this patch., Reattaching the patch to check the radio box for granting license., -1 overall.

 the code seems to be catching NullPointerException() and throwing a new Exception. Why are we catching a NullPointerException()? Shouldnt this be taken care of in the code itself?, Removed NullPointerException catch and fixed a typo in the comment., Reattaching again with the grant license :P, -1 overall.
