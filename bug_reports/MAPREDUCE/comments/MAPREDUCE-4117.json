[I have attached patch to fix this issue., Thanks for the patch Devaraj. One case I'm wondering about is when getTaskFailureEventString is called on a Job with only non-TaskCompletionEvent.Status.FAILED events. Seems like lastEvent will still be null in that case., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

When the Job is failed and it doesn't contain any task attempts(i.e Job is failed before launching any tasks itself) then the lastEvent will be null and it will lead to NPE.

 If the Job fails and job contains some attempts means the job should have failed because of task failures. This case lastEvent will not be null., {quote}

These test failures are not related to the patch., My initial thought was the same as yours. However, in TypeConverter, you will see that both JobState.FAILED and JobState.ERROR are translated to JobStatus.State.FAILED. I believe it to be to much to assume that if JobStatus.State is FAILED, then you will be guaranteed to have either 1)a failed task completion event or 2) no task completion events at all. It is much more clear and simple to me to check for null in this case., I am sorry Jon. It's my bad, I have mentioned the name wrongly in the above comment.

Thanks for looking and identifying all the cases. I have attached the patch as per your suggestion., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

np. this will be a great addition to the cli. i have verified that the test fail without the patch and succeed with the patch.
, I should have stated +1 (non-binding). A committer will need to put this in, I agree with Jon, +1.  I merged this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2106 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2106/])
