Fixing a typo in a property.

RE: whitespace

Patch contains whitespace because original code contains whitespace for the property.
, +1, confirmed compatibility - it's OK to change REDUCER_INPUT_VALUE_CLASS since REDUCER_INPUT_VALUE_CLASS is protected value and only used in Chain.java. The value set as REDUCER_INPUT_VALUE_CLASS isn't used from anywhere., Committed this to trunk and branch-2.
