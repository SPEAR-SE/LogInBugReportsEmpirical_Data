  against trunk revision 832ebd8.

    {color:red}-1 patch{color}.  The patch command could not apply the patch.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/5082//console

This message is automatically generated., FYI, for my testing

    hadoop jar <jarWithoutFix> pi 6 6

gives the exception in the description.

Doing the same command with the fixed jar gives me the result:
