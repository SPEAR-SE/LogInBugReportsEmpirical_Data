[Instead, we should allocate a buffer of 1MB or so random data (larger than the typical compression window of LZ-based algorithms) and stripe that buffer into the output file. This will make the benchmark results more representative of typical workloads where the data being written has already been compressed at the file format level., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0.  Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2.]
