[Can you describe the issue more clearly? What do you mean oracle support? , By 'oracle support' I mean querying an oracle database. There was a problem with hadoop's DBInputFormat.java expecting the database to use LIMIT and OFFSET, whereas oracle's uses ROWNUM. hadoop-1.0.0's code didn't account for this and database queries attempting LIMIT and OFFSET would throw errors. This patch corrects that.
