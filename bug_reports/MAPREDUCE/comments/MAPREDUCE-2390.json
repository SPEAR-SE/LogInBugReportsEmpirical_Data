[Is this reproducible on trunk too? If it's only in CDH, this should go on the Cloudera JIRA., MAPREDUCE-1382 fixes this, but what's odd is that:

JT says this:
{code}
2011-06-12 00:00:34,924 WARN org.apache.hadoop.util.MRAsyncDiskService: Cannot create toBeDeleted in /Users/harshchouraria/Work/installs/temp-space/mapred/local1. Ignored.
{code}

TT does this instead:
{code}
2011-06-12 00:00:35,980 WARN org.apache.hadoop.util.DiskChecker: Incorrect permissions were set on /Users/harshchouraria/Work/installs/temp-space/mapred/local1, expected: rwxr-xr-x, while actual: ---------. Fixing...
{code}

May be worth making JT do this too, if its gonna use {{mapred.local.dir}} (or w/e its new alias is) after all., Resolving as Duplicate of MAPREDUCE-1382 (Which is fixed in 0.22)]
