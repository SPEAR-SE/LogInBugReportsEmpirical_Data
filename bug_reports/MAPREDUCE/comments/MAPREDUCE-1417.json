This message is automatically generated., Only one test TestTaskFail erred out, mostly MAPREDUCE-1275. The current patch is documentation only and hence the failure is clearly unrelated. I ran the test with the patch anyways and it passed on my local machine. I am going to commit this., I just committed this. Thanks Ravi!]
