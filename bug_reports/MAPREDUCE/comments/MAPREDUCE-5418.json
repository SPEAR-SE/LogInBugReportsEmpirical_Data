[To reproduce this, ran sleep job thrice. Killed the AM for the second job. As in the attached screen shots, the second job is missing in the JHS UI., Possible approach:
- An auxiliary service on the NM can write diagnostic information, container logs and other info (like Counters) to a pre-defined directory in HDFS. The JHS can subsequently read this information, in the same way it reads information from completed applications. , dont think you'll get counters in case of MRAM crash. I think what we could craft for the jobhistory entry like:

* user (from job.xml?)
* job.xml
* start time (aprox by using job.xml file timestamp from the localized file)
* end time (time the container gone event arrives to the auxiliary service)
* queue (from job.xml)
* all counters to zero
* no known tasks
* AM logs

Not sure there is a better way of doing this., bq. An auxiliary service on the NM can write diagnostic information, container logs and other info (like Counters) to a pre-defined directory in HDFS. The JHS can subsequently read this information, in the same way it reads information from completed applications.
Generally, more stuff should move to the AHS (YARN-321). As much as possible. We could make JHS first learn about the job, then periodically poll the RM for applications list, filter out MR apps, and then show them. But AHS is on the way, so JHS could just poll AHS?, bq. But AHS is on the way, so JHS could just poll AHS?
+1. Even if we try to fix it some other way before AHS is ready to be used, we should update it to use the AHS., Few related tickets that I created last year: don't think these have been addressed in newer versions, Robert seems to be working on this in MAPREDUCE-5641. Closing as a duplicate. , [~kasha], shouldn't this be marked as "duplicate" rather than "fixed" ?]
