[Karam, did you use -Dhadoop.job.ugi to submit the job ? In which case, can we see if in Hadoop 0.21 maybe we resolve the user to the right group and override the specified value ? Or maybe the resolution of user to group is done on the server, which actually is the right thing to do ?, yes I used hadoop.job.ugi, I think you mean "Acls are *not* working properly when they are to user groups " in the Summary., Probably, closer to the intent: "Acls are not working properly when they are set to user groups", Closing this as stale.]
