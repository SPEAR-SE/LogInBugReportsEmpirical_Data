This message was automatically generated., Please disregard all previous patches. Uploading the latest patch shortly., This is the latest revised patch. A messageReceived() call uses two counters mapsToWait and mapsToSend within the ReduceContext class for throttling the number of sendMapOutput calls. Due to asynchronous nature of Netty, these counters are atomic. A revised test case that mocks Netty operations is also included. 

Every completed IO operation by sendMapOutput will start another until the entire mapIds list for a given request is processed., Requesting [~nroberts]  and [~jlowe] to review the revised patch. Thanks., \\

This message was automatically generated., Updating field Target version as 2.7.2. Fix version is added when the issue is committed!!, Requesting [~nroberts] , [~jlowe] , [~jeagles] for their comments/review. Thanks!, Thanks for the patch, Kuhu!

Do we really need getShuffle/setShuffle and a new shuffle field?  Much simpler to access pipelineFact.SHUFFLE directly or add a getShuffle method to HttpPipelineFactory and use that.  We shouldn't be redundantly tracking shuffle in the ShuffleHandler class.

Rather than catch and swallowing the exception from metrics.operationComplete (which shouldn't happen), can't we just let this propagate up?  I would think it would eventually trigger exceptionCaught to be called which should do the right thing like any other exception on the channel.

The ChannelHandlerContext has the corresponding channel, so do we really need SendMapOutputParams to store it separately?

SendMapOutputParams should be treated like an immutable object.  There's no need to set any of its contents after it is created, so we should just remove all the set methods.  Same applies to ReduceContext.  Actually I'm not really sure why SendMapOutputParams exists separate from ReduceContext.  There should be a one-to-one relationship there.  I think we could just promote all of the members of SendMapOutputParams into ReduceContext and cut down on some of the excess boilerplate.

ReduceContext has an unused Configuration variable and getConf is never called.

Seems like we could associate the ReduceContext with the ReduceMapFileCount listener object directly when we construct it.  That way we don't have to fish it out of the channel attachment and the code plays nicer with other things that might want to use the channel attachment for something.

It looks like we can now send an INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR followed by a NOT_FOUND error since sendMap will return null when it sends an internal error.  Maybe sendMap should take care of sending all the appropriate errors directly.

Why was reduceContext added as a TestShuffleHandler instance variable?  It's specific to the new test.

The test would be a bit more readable with some factoring out of some code to utility methods, e.g.: createMockChannel method which takes care of mocking up all the stuff needed to mock a channel.  Also the overridden ShuffleHandler is enough code that it should just be a separate class within the test rather than inline in the method.

Nit: The comment for mapreduce.shuffle.max.send.map.count should mention simultaneous or concurrent otherwise it implies it will only send that many outputs total.  Also it may be more clear if the property were named something like mapreduce.shuffle.max.session-open-files or something similar, although I'm not super excited about that name either.

Nit: some (all?) of the returns in ReduceMapFileCount.operationComplete would be easier to follow using an {{else}} clause, e.g.:
{code}
      if (waitCount == 0) {
        metrics.operationComplete(future);
        future.getChannel().close();
      } else {
        shuffle.sendMap(rc.getSendMapOutputParams().getCtx(),
            rc.getSendMapOutputParams().getInfoMap());
      }
{code}

Nit: whitespace between field definitions and internal class definitions and also between method definitions would help readability.

Nit: Per the coding conventions class and instance variables should appear before constructors which in turn appear before methods

Nit: variables should be declared when they are initialized if possible, e.g.: nextId and mapId in sendMap.

Nit: Please organize the imports in the test, there's a mix of static and non-static imports.
, Thank you so much [~jlowe] for the detailed feedback. I have made all but 2 changes and request your further comments on that.

{quote}

I totally agree. The only reason was findbugs which does not allow more than 7 parameters in a function call( or the constructor that would populate these values). If this is not an issue, I can move them into a single class. For now I have made SendMapOutputParams an inner class to ReduceContext.

{quote}

{quote}

The reduceContext is a variable holds the value set by the setAttachment() method and is used by the getAttachment() answer. If I declare it in the test method, it needs be final which cannot be done due to it being used by the setter. I am looking for another way. Let me know what you think.

All other items have been done. , \\

bq. The only reason was findbugs which does not allow more than 7 parameters in a function call
Normally a builder pattern is used to make the code more readable in those situations.  However I don't think we need more than 7.  ReduceContext really only needs mapIds, reduceId, channelCtx, user, infoMap, and outputBasePathStr.  The other two parameters are either known to be zero (should not be passed) and can be derived from another (size of mapIds).  As such we don't need SendMapOutputParams.

bq. The reduceContext is a variable holds the value set by the setAttachment() method and is used by the getAttachment() answer. If I declare it in the test method, it needs be final which cannot be done due to it being used by the setter.
createMockChannel can simply have a ReduceContext parameter, marked final, and that should solve that problem.  But I thought we were getting rid of the use of channel attachments and just associating the context with the listener directly?

Related to the last comment, we're still using channel attachments.  sendMap can just take a ReduceContext parameter, and the listener can provide its context when calling it.  No need for channel attachments.

This can NPE since we're checking for null after we already use it:
{noformat}
+            nextMap = sendMapOutput(
+                reduceContext.getSendMapOutputParams().getCtx(),
+                reduceContext.getSendMapOutputParams().getCtx().getChannel(),
+                reduceContext.getSendMapOutputParams().getUser(), mapId,
+                reduceContext.getSendMapOutputParams().getReduceId(), info);
+            nextMap.addListener(new ReduceMapFileCount(reduceContext));
+            if (null == nextMap) {
{noformat}

maxSendMapCount should be cached during serviceInit like the other conf-derived settings so we aren't doing conf lookups on every shuffle.

The indentation in sendMap isn't correct, as code is indented after a conditional block at the same level as the contents of the conditional block.  There's other places that are over-indented.

MockShuffleHandler only needs to override one thing, getShuffle, but the mock that method returns has to override a bunch of stuff.  It makes more sense to create a separate class for the mocked Shuffle than the mocked ShuffleHandler.

Should the mock Future stuff be part of creating the mocked channel?  Can simply pass the listener list to use as an arg to the method that mocks up the channel.

Nit: SHUFFLE_MAX_SEND_COUNT should probably be something like SHUFFLE_MAX_SESSION_OPEN_FILES to better match the property name.  Similarly maxSendMapCount could have a more appropriate name.

Nit: Format for 80 columns

Nit: There's still instances where we have a class definition immediately after variable definitions and a lack of whitespace between classes and methods or between methods. Whitespace would help readability in those places., Modified ShuffleHandler to not use channel attachments. Moved MockNetty code to a helper method., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~jlowe] Thank you so much for the comments. I have updated the patch with all modifications but the Test Shuffle class separation one. Appreciate your feedback., Thanks for updating the patch.  I see now that since Shuffle is not a static class it's too much trouble to try to factor out the overrides for the test.

ReduceContext should be a private class.

sendMap takes a reduce context, a channel context, and an info map, but the latter two are already in the reduce context.  Seems like sendMap should just take a reduce context argument.

If sendMap returns null then I don't think we want messageReceived to blindly keep calling sendMap in the loop.

Why were the override decorators removed from verifyRequest and getMapOutputInfo?  It's pretty important that those actually override a method.

mockNetty is too monolothic like the old test and a bit unwieldy in that callers are expected to start mocking and then let mockNetty finish the job.  The channel and message event mocking is just a few simple lines for each and would be fine to stay in the main test method.  Utility methods like createMockChannelFuture(channel, listenerList) and createMockHttpRequest() would help keep the original test method manageable in length and factor out some of the more complicated mocking of individual objects.
, sendMap should have only reduceContext as an argument. Test refactored to have helper methods., \\

This message was automatically generated., [~jlowe], thank you for your comments. I regret the oversight. Modified as suggested. Please let me know if any other changes are required., +1 latest patch looks good to me.  Will commit tomorrow if there are no further comments., One minor comment. If it's not too much trouble, could you add some comments about why we need to limit the number of FDs, how the code is accomplishing it, and why atomic operations need to be used in send_map(). It will help future maintainers of the code understand some of the rationale behind the complexities in this area. 
, Adding documentation comments., \\
