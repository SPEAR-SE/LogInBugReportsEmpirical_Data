This message is automatically generated., +1 looks good. Could you please run test-patch target and paste the results here., There are two changes which needs to be done in order to fix the Null Pointer Exception.
1. Job tracker was not setting the job statuses for the leaf queues, so we need to fix the job tracker to set the running job statuses for the leaf queues.
2. When we are decserializing the jobqueueInfo object at the client side then it was actually expecting the jobqueueInfo object however from the Queinfo class we were passing the Queinfo object which needs to be changed to jobqueueInfo object., Latest patch, Test is not included as it is a command line option for show the listing of the queues

mapred queue -list
