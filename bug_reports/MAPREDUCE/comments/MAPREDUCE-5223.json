[HADOOP-8921 is a long-standing similar bug with a patch available (but not committed).  Do you think this is a duplicate?

As part of HADOOP-8921, I had proposed the following change, but there was disagreement, so it's not included in the latest HADOOP-8921 patch.

{code}
-  <target name="task-controller" depends="init">
+  <target name="task-controller" depends="init" if="${compile.native}">
{code}
, Why do we need a special switch for task-controller? IMO, using the native switch -as proposed by Chris- should be enough, no?, Relating to HADOOP-8921.  It might be helpful for the participants on this issue to review the discussion over there.]
