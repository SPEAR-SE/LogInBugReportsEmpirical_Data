This message is automatically generated., Quick comments on the patch:
 - The patch needs to be updated after YARN-117. You should only override serviceInit()/serviceStart()/serviceStop() in the new service.
 - Default launcher should be the new launcher.
 - Should ContainerLauncherViaNMClient.serviceStop() inspect super.cleanupRunningContainers to clear taskAttemptIds?
 - Rename the new config to be yarn.app.mapreduce.am.container-launcher.class
 - Similarly MRJobConfig.MR_AM_CONTAINER_LAUNCHER to MRJobConfig.MR_AM_CONTAINER_LAUNCHER_CLASS
 - MRAppMaster: Simply catch Exception and wrap it instead of catching each one.
 - Test:
    -- The records in setup() can just be creating instead of mocking and then at the end of it returning every field.
    -- In case of startContainer error, validate that specific TaskAttempt event is handled instead of just the number? Lines +134 and +171, bq. Should ContainerLauncherViaNMClient.serviceStop() inspect super.cleanupRunningContainers to clear taskAttemptIds?

cleanupRunningContainers is not accessible as it is a protected field and not be part of NMClientAsync, but NMClientImpl, In addition to addressing Vinod's comments, I changed ContainerLauncherViaNMClient to directly implement CallbackHandler, instead of having a private field which implements CallbackHandler, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Instead of the 'hack', how about making the new launcher not extend NMClientAsync and just compose it? That should avoid it altogether.

Anyways, there are some formatting issues in the new launcher, please fix them., Refactor the code according to Vinod's comments, rebase against the latest trunk, and fix the format issue., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
