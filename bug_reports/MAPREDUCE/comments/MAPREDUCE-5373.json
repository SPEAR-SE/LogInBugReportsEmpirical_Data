[In the test setup, 3 fetch failures for the same maptask will trigger a "too many fetch failures event" and cause the map task to relaunch. This test accidentally sends 4 fetch failures triggering the maptask to relaunch to early, causing a race condition in the assert for the current state of the maptask. This patch removes the unnecessary 4th fetch failure, eliminating the race condition., Manual testing completed. Test run show 5 failures out of 30 before the patch and 0 failures out of 30 after the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
