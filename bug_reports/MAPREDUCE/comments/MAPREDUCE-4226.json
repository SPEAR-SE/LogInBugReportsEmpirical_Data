This message is automatically generated., +1. lgtm, The patch looks good to me too.  I see one small issue that was already in the code before the patch, but I would like to see fixed. Write(DataOutputStream) is not synchronized.  I assume that this is not a big deal because it can only be a problem if we are writing out the counters at the same time we are adding in new counters.  I don't think that happens very often, but if it does the number of schemes or the number of counters in a scheme could be off.  This could result in exceptions on the reader side, or possibly some data corruption in the counters on the reader side.

I also would like to see this fix go into branch-0.23 (The patch appears to apply cleanly with no issues).
, I'm not sure if this is a problem in practice since counters are all written together, and o.a.h.mapreduce.counters.AbstractCounters#write() is synchronized, as is findCounter() which is used to access and increment framework counters (e.g. in FileSystemStatisticUpdater). So I think we can commit this as an incremental improvement, and follow up with another JIRA if there does turn out to be a problem with synchronization on FileSystemCounterGroup or FrameworkCounterGroup. Does that sound reasonable?, I wasn't sure if it was a critical issue or not, because I didn't have much context with how this class was used.  I am +1 for putting in the patch unchanged.  I still think it needs to be fixed, mostly as defensive programming so that if things do change in the future this issue does not crop up.  Especially because it is just a single line change that should not really impact the performance as it is only being called from something that is holding a bigger lock., Robert, I opened MAPREDUCE-4230 for the follow-on issue. I've just committed this (to the 0.23 and 2 branches)., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #2198 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/2198/])
