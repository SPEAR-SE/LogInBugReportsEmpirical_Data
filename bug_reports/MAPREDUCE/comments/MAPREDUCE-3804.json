This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me +1.  Could you please file a separate JIRA for the failure in org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.monitor.TestContainersMonitor.  It appears to not be related to this fix at all, but I could not find another JIRA for it, even though I found others where it also failed for them., @bobby/Dave,
 The reason TestContainersMonitor fails is due to MAPREDUCE-3583. I'd suggest re running through hudson just to make sure everything else is fine., Thanks Dave, I just committed this to trunk and 0.23, @Mahadev, I did rerun org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.containermanager.monitor.TestContainersMonitor myself before committing and it passed., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1746 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1746/])
