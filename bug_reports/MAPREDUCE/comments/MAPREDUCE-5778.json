[Attaching a patch., Thank you for taking this JIRA, Akira. Can you attach job summaries before and after your modification?, Thank you for your comment, Tsuyoshi.
In fact the modification couldn't escape newlines. I'll attach a new patch and job summaries before and after., Looked around the logs, I found ApplicationSummary does not escape newlines also.
I filed YARN-1789 to track this., Attaching a patch, it escapes newlines as follows: 
before
{code}
2014-03-06 07:25:31,476 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.jobhistory.JobSummary: jobId=job_1394057583500_0002,submitTime=1394058253665,launchTime=1394058261607,firstMapTaskLaunchTime=1394058264006,firstReduceTaskLaunchTime=1394058271899,finishTime=1394058277328,resourcesPerMap=512,resourcesPerReduce=512,numMaps=1,numReduces=1,user=root,queue=default,status=SUCCEEDED,mapSlotSeconds=5,reduceSlotSeconds=5,jobName=word
count
{code}
after
{code}
2014-03-06 10:09:15,338 INFO org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.jobhistory.JobSummary: jobId=job_1394067952388_0001,submitTime=1394067985813,launchTime=1394068001404,firstMapTaskLaunchTime=1394068003984,firstReduceTaskLaunchTime=1394068014719,finishTime=1394068023681,resourcesPerMap=512,resourcesPerReduce=512,numMaps=1,numReduces=1,user=root,queue=default,status=SUCCEEDED,mapSlotSeconds=8,reduceSlotSeconds=8,jobName=word[LF]count
{code}, Looks good. Can you add tests?, Personally I'd prefer the original escaping, CR=\r and LF=\n as that's straightforward to translate back to the original job string.  [CR] and [LF] are non-standard., Thanks Tsuyoshi and Jason for the reviews!
I attached a patch that reflects your comments., LGTM. Waiting for Jenkins report., [~ajisakaa], I noticed one minor point while waiting for Jenkins:

{code}
 private static JobSummary summary = new JobSummary();
{code}

We should avoid creating static object if we can. Can you fix it? Thanks, Thanks, I fixed it., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
