This looks like the bug I hit. Can I work around it by running the job as the user mapred? From the bug report, that should work.

This message is automatically generated., Hudson is right, I should write a unit test for this., Todd, any update on this for 0.22?, Marking blocked by MAPREDUCE-2445, since I want to add another test case to that file. Patch forthcoming on top of that one., Here's a patch on top of MAPREDUCE-2445 including a unit test (which fails without this bug fix)

Will mark patch avail after 2445 is in., If security isn't enabled then won't the SecureIOUtils.openForRead() call ignore the username that's passed in?

The new configuration parameter name should begin "mapreduce", not "mapred", for consistency., Good point on the config name. Fixed.

As for whether this is actually a real bug -- now that HADOOP-7172 has gone in, you're right that this won't cause a problem. But, as a matter of principle, we might as well put the right expected owner in the data structure :), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
