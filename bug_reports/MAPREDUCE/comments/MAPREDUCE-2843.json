I tried with newly setup environment as well.
But the test case is passing.

I executed the tests like following

Can you try to run the same patch again?

Is there difference betweem the way i execute the tests and the way hudson does it?



Thanks & Regards,
Abhijit, Abhijit,
 Jenkins just runs mvn test (please see dev-support/test-patch.sh). Can you take a look at:
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/677/testReport/org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.webapp/TestNodesPage/testNodesBlockRender/

to see whats the issue with jenkins? Why do you need to pass -Dcommons.daemon.os.arch=i686? , Mahadev,

I am running the build on Windows 7 OS. 
But hadoop-hdfs-project/hadoop-hdfs/pom.xml file has os support for linux & Mac OS.
Due to this my build was failing. 
So as a workaround i am passing those properties explicitly on the command line.

I tried with mvn test as well but still the testcase is passing.

I will try with linux.

Is it possible for you to also test this in your development environment?

This message is automatically generated., Need to fix the failing testcase. Hence cancelling this patch, Sorry for the late review, as I was on vacation/transition. Though I'm impressed with the effort going into the test, which demonstrates the fine grained mockability of Hamlet views, it'd be a lot easier to use the existing WebAppTests.test* library methods, so the only thing you need to setup is the rm context and do an in order verification of the empty trailing cell (maybe n/a is better?):
{code}
PrintWriter writer = WebAppTests.testBlock(...).getInstance(PrintWriter.class);
verify(writer).print("<td");
verify(writer).print("n/a");
{code}, Hi Lu,
Thanks a lot for reviewing..i have added testcase with different logic.
The purpose is to make sure that the number of th cells must match the td cells in a row.


Thanks & Regards,
Abhijit, Why is a custom writer/validator necessary? It seems:
{code}
verify(writer, times(numHeaderCells).print("<th");
verify(writer, times(numDataCells).print("<td");
{code}
would suffice., I was trying to write a more generic testcase to validate the generated table format. Thats why i added a custom validator which i thought could be improved later to test diferent issues with table structure. 

Anyways, i have added another patch which does exactly what you have suggested.

bq. I was trying to write a more generic testcase to validate the generated table format.

I'm weary of "generic" code that's not actually generic, especially with scary statement (as in the .2 patch) like this:
{code}
if (tag.startsWith("<th") && tag.length() == 3) {
...
{code}

Also it's recommended to use {{import static org.mockito.Mockito.*;}} for more idiomatic mockito usage, when there is no actual conflict., Hi lu,
Thanks for the review & feedback!!

Abhijit, +1. Looks good to me too. Verified that it is working on a single node., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Abhijit!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1052 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1052/])
