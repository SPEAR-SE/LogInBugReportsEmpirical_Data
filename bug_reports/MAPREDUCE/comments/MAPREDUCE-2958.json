[Saw the same thing. Looks like reduce tasks are not being run.
Setting the number of reduce tasks (-Dmapred.reduce.tasks=X) works though., It looks like the mapred-defaults.xml isn't included in any of the mapreduce-client jar files.  It used to be in the client-core jar.  That is what was setting the default number of reduces to 1.  The code current defaults to 0 if not specified.

        job.numReduceTasks = job.conf.getInt(MRJobConfig.NUM_REDUCES, 0);
, it looks like the ./mr-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/resources/ directory never got merged to trunk from mr-279 branch. That directory included the mapred-default.xml that included the default reducers. 

Assigned to Mahadev to investigate if it was intentional or accidentally missed during the merge., Thanks Thomas, I fixed it by doing an 'svn copy' to both trunk and branch-0.23.]
