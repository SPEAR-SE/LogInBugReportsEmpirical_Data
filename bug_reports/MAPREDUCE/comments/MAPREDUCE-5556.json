[Per http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable1/mapred_tutorial.html#Usage:

{code}$ javac -classpath ${HADOOP_HOME}/hadoop-${HADOOP_VERSION}-core.jar -d wordcount_classes WordCount.java{code}

This appears syntactically correct, but the filename is likely to be hadoop-core-${HADOOP_VERSION}.jar instead of that.

Or were you reporting an ease of use issue [~aw]? If it was just the above, +1 to making and committing that trivial change.

The newer docs use the java tools jar compiler class via the {{hadoop}} command., I've gone ahead and fixed this trivial issue by committing the attached change, to branch-1.

This is not an issue on trunk/branch-2. Thanks for reporting Allen!]
