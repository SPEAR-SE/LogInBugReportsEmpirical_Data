[Similar to HADOOP-7779, I posted a comment on HADOOP-7779. If its resolved as a "Won't Fix", this should just target the duplication of HADOOP_CONF_DIR and then be resolved., HADOOP-10903 added support for this in the {{hadoop classpath}} command, but we didn't do the same for the other scripts' classpath commands.  We can repurpose this issue to cover that change for the {{mapred}} script.  Thanks to [~aw] for pointing it out to me., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Kindly review, Hello [~varun_saxena].  For the trunk patch, you'll need to add a call to {{exit /b}} in mapred.cmd so that it doesn't attempt to start a JVM when running {{mapred classpath}} with no additional arguments.  Would you also provide a patch for branch-2?  Thank you., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I retested the mapred.cmd change, but unfortunately it still doesn't have the right behavior.  Calling {{exit /b}} from within the {{classpath}} subroutine exits just the subroutine, not the whole script, so it still ends up trying to launch a JVM.  I think we'll need to restructure this so it's more like yarn.cmd, where the classpath command is handled as a special case outside of the other command handling.  That way, the {{exit /b}} would exit from the top-level mapred.cmd script., Oh. Thought {{exit /b}} was like an overall system exit. Did not have access to a WINDOWS OS at that time so could not test. Will upload a new patch after testing., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
