[I really think we should fix this before releasing any version that has a potential of becoming Hadoop 1.0. I'll try to see if I can cook up a patch to fix it. If not -- I'd say it is better to disable this example, rather than shipping a broken one.

Agreed?, Moved requested target versions from Fix Version to Target Version field.
Absent a viable patch in time for 1.0.0, this will have to go in 1.1.0., Matt, what's the cut-off date for providing a patch? I'd really like to see this fixed in 1.0., Ok, so this appears to be fixed in branch-1.0 rev 1207581

Is this the branch from which 1.0.0 will be cut from?, The patch makes the code comapatible with LongWritable as final Output value class, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch is prepared on branch:
http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-1

The patch resolves an issue in hadoop-example; so tests not included., Subroto, thanks for providing a patch.  Unfortunately you also set the "Fix Version" to 1.0.0, which implies it is already fixed in 1.0.0, which it apparently isn't, according to Roman's email of today.  (Although Roman's comment of 28/Nov/11 21:49 also seems to imply it was fixed in 1.0.0.  Perhaps that was user error.)

Please do not set "Fix Version" until after the patch is committed to a given version.  The intent or desire to have a fix in a given version should be expressed in "Target Version", not "Fix Version".

+1 for code review, lgtm.  Committed to branch-1 for future release 1.1.0.
Thanks Subroto!, It appears this change is also applicable to trunk, file
hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-examples/src/main/java/org/apache/hadoop/examples/MultiFileWordCount.java

Subroto, please port your patch to trunk and post another patch.
Then I can resolve this jira.  Thank you., Hi Matt,

I ran the *multifilewc* in trunk (mrv2) and it runs fine.

I think the problem is resolved in trunk already., Okay, Subroto, thanks.
Release 1.0.0 RC had to be re-spun, so merged this fix as promised., Thanks Matt..., Closed upon release of version 1.0.0.]
