[Wrap log aggregation init with a try block.  The log init is executed just before localization starts instead of in parallel.  Log init sends back an app finish event on failure, or a log init success after which localization begins.

Log init is serialized because it only makes a few directories and spins off a thread.  If log init fails then the job itself is likely to fail, so a log init failure reports a diagnostic of the exception back to the AM.  Otherwise if/when the job fails there will be no logs to debug..., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., For a little background, the problem was detected due to a NN token issue.  The NMs all went down because log aggregation init failed to connect to the NN to create its log dirs.  The NMs were started up again, and they all went down again because the AMs were retrying the tasks.  The problem was also induced by restricting permissions on the log dir and stopping the NN., The changes look mostly straight forward.  Also the unit tests look OK.  Have you done any manual testing?, Yes, I manually tested by doing things like replacing the log dir with a file to force the mkdir to fail., Sounds good +1, Thanks Daryn,
