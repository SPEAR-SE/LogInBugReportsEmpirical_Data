, Vinod/Thomas/Arun - a query on task.sh - the final command i.e. "exec setsid /bin/bash -c ..." encapsulates the user provided command with "". The assumption here seems to be they can use environment variables with the command for expansion and that the onus of correctly escaping the command i.e escaping any special chars is on the users themselves. Would that be correct?

For example, creating the symlink above is pretty simply by just quoting the file name but if the symlink is something that will be executed then special chars like "&" or even basic things like spaces can create problems if not quoted and escaped properly.  , Attaching a simple patch for now which addresses the immediate bug related to symlinks with special chars. 

, Will open a separate jira to track what should be done for escaping user input ( commands, filenames ) in general before we use/execute them. , you forgot to add the apache header to the new file., Add required apache header and minor test cleanup. , +1 overall.
