This message is automatically generated., The new Application state transition - INITING to FINISHED on APP_INIT_FAILED will cause problems with subsequent startContainer() (new containers will be stuck in the NEW state) and finishApplication() calls. Like the patch says - an additional state, which would have to deal with new container and finishApp requests. Also, an intermittent failure in app initialization would end up making the node unusable for the specific app.

Changing DCE to remove the delete in {code}createAppDirs{code} is probably a simpler fix ? job.jar and job.xml are separate App resources which are localized into their own directory. One failing should not affect the other (will only affect the container associated with the failed localization attempt). Don't think the comment in the code about cleaning up the dir is valid., Here's the simple fix as suggested. I didn't change any unit tests, unfortunately. We should probably file a follow-up to increase functional test coverage of the container executor subsystem., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
