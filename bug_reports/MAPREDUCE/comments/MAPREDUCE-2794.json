[There are two issues mentioned in this JIRA:
1. AvailableGB metrics for user queue is higher than what it is for the default queue

2. AvailableGB does not reflect the "real time" AvailableGB in the case of user queue.

Issue (1) is because user queue rounds up to the next "minimum allocation". This patch tries to round up all the leaf queues (not just the user leaf queue) to the next minimum allocation. 

Issue (2) is because AvailableGB is not updated every time an allocation is made.

The uploaded patch is to check if the approach is acceptable or if there are any other suggestions to solve this..., John, the patch seems reasonable - can you please add a test case? Thanks., Uploading a patch with unit tests, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
