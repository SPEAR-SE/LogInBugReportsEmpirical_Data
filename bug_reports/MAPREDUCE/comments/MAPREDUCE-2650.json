This message is automatically generated., the changes in TaskLog seem to change semantics -- it used to just WARN if permissions couldn't be set, but now it throws an exception?, Todd,
I think you are referring IOException in Localizer.java.
It throws an exception when makedirs failed, not permission couldn't be set. , Todd,
I did not make it clear in previous comment.
Throws an exception (when makedirs failed) semantics are used in trunk and CDH3.
It's good to put it in 0.20-security., Sherry,
 I think Todd's comment was on localFS.setPermission() calls. Those calls would throw an exception in this patch and would just return false with a log warning in the original code. Is that correct? 

Infact all the calls to setpermission have to been changed.

The mkdirs change is ok, but the other changes am not sure should be part of this patch?, Actually just read through the comments in MAPREDUCE-2238. The patch looks good. 

can you please post the results of ant test?

, ant test passed., I just pushed this. Thanks Sherry!, Closed upon release of 0.20.205.0]
