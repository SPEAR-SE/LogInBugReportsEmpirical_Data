[Thanks to John Poelman and Shreyas Subramanya of IBM BigInsights performance QA for noticing the issue and verifying my fix., The crux of the problem is jetty 6.1.26's internal buffer management with transfer-encoding = chunked. The issue was also independently discovered and analyzed elsewhere: http://goo.gl/Wln7Z, Given the code is the same, this may not be regression compared to 0.20.2. However, this is straightforward change, and given the link you posted, I am +1 on committing this., I committed the patch to branch-1 and for 1.1.0. 

Thank you Luke for the patch. Thank you John Poelman and Shreyas Subramanya for noticing the issue and verifying the fix., Nicholas, can you please verify if this is an issue for WebHDFS (both on 1.0 and trunk?), @Suresh, 0.20.2 use jetty 6.1.14, which doesn't have this particular issue. This is a workaround specifically for jetty 6.1.26 and harmless for other versions., Committed to branch-1.1 and branch-1.0.  Thanks, Luke!, Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.0.4.]
