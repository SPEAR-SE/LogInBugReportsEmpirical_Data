[Hi Jason, I looked into this problem and this is a bug in RecoveryService of MRv2. The cause is that the RecoveryService didn't consider the commiter type (new api commiter or old api commiter).
I can submit a patch to this issue soon.

, Thanks, Jerry!  I committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23.

Note that in the future, the "Fix Version/s" field is reserved for recording where the issue was actually fixed and should only be set when the fix is checked in.  The "Target Version/s" field is better suited for indicating where a patch should be integrated if accepted., Thansk for your comment and help checked in, Jason. I will follow the these guidelines for future work., Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #92 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/92/])
