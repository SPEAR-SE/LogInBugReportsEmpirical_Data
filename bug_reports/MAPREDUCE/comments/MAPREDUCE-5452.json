[This actually leads to non minor issues in downstream projects. See HIVE-4216, I think it is a case of using the wrong constructor. Ideally applications should never construct or parse TaskID strings, but where that is not possible, one should use the appropriate constructors which provide all the information or the forName API. For e.g, even if we fix this, toString will print the wrong ID (the default).

I just saw HIVE-4216, the comment by Andrey [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-4216?focusedCommentId=13848792&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-13848792] seems like a reasonable solution.

There are far too many empty constructors like this in all of Hadoop that aren't expected to be used directly. Fixing them is a lot of work for too little ROI. I propose that we close it as WON'T FIX., toString() should never throw a NPE, so I don't think we should close as WON'T FIX. However, I agree this is a low priority item and that the Hive fix should be implemented regardless of the change made here.]
