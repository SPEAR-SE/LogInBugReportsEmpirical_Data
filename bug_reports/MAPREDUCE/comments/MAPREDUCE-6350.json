This message was automatically generated., Hi [~mitdesai], thank you for your feedback, I have uploaded patch v3 that fixed those style issues., Thanks [~l201514] for the patch.

Patch mostly looks good except these nits.

1. Can you move the new configuration "mapreduce.jobhistory.jobname.limit" and the default value to JHAdminConfig.java.

{code:xml}
+  private static final int JOB_NAME_TRIM_LENGTH = 50;
{code}

{code:xml}
+        int jobNameLimit =
+            getConfig().getInt("mapreduce.jobhistory.jobname.limit", JOB_NAME_TRIM_LENGTH);
{code}

2. In FileNameIndexUtils.java, can you remove the JOB_NAME_TRIM_LENGTH declaration and access it from JHAdminConfig.java.

3. Please add tests for covering this change., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks [~devaraj.k] for your feedback, I have uploaded patch v5 that addressed those nits and added a test case., Thanks [~l201514] for the updated patch.

1. Can you address the checkstyle reported by jenkins? You need to add the period at the end of the inline comment.

{code:xml}
+   * Number of characters allowed for job name in Job History Server web page
{code}

2. Please add the new configuration in mapred-default.xml under 'jobhistory properties'.

3. Can you change the constant names JOB_NAME_TRIM_LENGTH & JOB_NAME_TRIM_LENGTH_DEFAULT  according to the configuration like MR_HS_JOBNAME_LIMIT & DEFAULT_MR_HS_JOBNAME_LIMIT  as show below. And also for the config value, make use of the MR_HISTORY_PREFIX.

{code:xml}
  /**
   * Number of characters allowed for job name in Job History Server web page.
   */
  public static final String MR_HS_JOBNAME_LIMIT = MR_HISTORY_PREFIX
      + "jobname.limit";
  public static final int DEFAULT_MR_HS_JOBNAME_LIMIT = 50;

Latest patch looks good to me. This patch is not directly applying to branch-2, can you update the patch for branch-2 as well?

And also please use the naming convention for patches like Issue-No-\*.patch (MAPREDUCE-6350\*.patch). Thanks., mapred-default.xml changes are not directly applying to branch-2.

Updating the patch for branch-2. , \\
