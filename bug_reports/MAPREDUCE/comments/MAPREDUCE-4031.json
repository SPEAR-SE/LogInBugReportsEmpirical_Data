[I am attaching the NM process thread dump for this issue., When we do NM shutdown, as part of NM shutdown, it acquires the class lock on java.lang.Shutdown and starts executing shut down hook for NM. It invokes the nm.stop() and  which will stop all the other services. When it tries to stop AsyncDispatcher, AsyncDispatcher will wait for eventHandlingThread to join. After starts executing shutdown hook and before come to wait for join on eventHandlingThread, if any exception occurs on eventHandlingThread, it will execute System.exit() in the catch block. This system.exit() in catch tries to acquire class lock java.lang.Shutdown which was holding by shutdown hook thread and waits forever. Shutdown hook thread also waits forever to join eventHandlingThread., I am attaching first level patch for review. Here changes involve in common also, I have added in this patch itself for review., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
