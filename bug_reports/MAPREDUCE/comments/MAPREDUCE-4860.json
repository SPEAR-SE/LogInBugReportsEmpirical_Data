[In fact, I wonder why we can't use common.DelegationTokenRenewer for token renewal. That avoids duplicating code too., Taking a closer look, the problem seems to be with the use of TimerTask/Timer.

If a task is already scheduled, calling task.cancel() from outside the task doesn't stop the scheduled task, but prevents the task from getting scheduled another time. However, the task can cancel itself.

The patch:
# adds a check within the task if it has been stopped from outside
# synchronizes changes to delegationTokens , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., delegationTokens is already a synchronized collection, except for the synchronization around the iterator() to avoid changes while iterating, I don't see why we need the others., Thanks for pointing that out Alejandro. Verified that all operations on synchronized collections are synchronized on the returned object.
