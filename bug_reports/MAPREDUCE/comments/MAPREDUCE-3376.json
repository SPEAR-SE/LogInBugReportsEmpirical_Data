[The OldCombinerRunner gets a valid reference of an reporter while creation(constructor). We can pass the same value instead of passing NULL reporter to:
{code}
combiner.reduce(values.getKey(), values, combineCollector,
              Reporter.NULL)
{code}, That is what I saw too, and I thought it would be a simple fix., The patch uses the reporter which sent as a reference rather than just using Reporter.NULL, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12505595/MAPREDUCE-3376.patch
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    -1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 12 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestMRJobsWithHistoryService
                  org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestMiniMRClientCluster
                  org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestUberAM
                  org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestClientRedirect

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

This message is automatically generated., The testcase failure and findbug comments are unrelated to patch.
The TestCode uses Depricated APIs and for the same *@SuppressWarnings("deprecation")* is also used., @Subroto,
 Can you please take a look at the failing tests?, @Subroto,
 I just ran the above tests without the patch, they seems to be running fine. Didnt get a chance to run it with the patch. Are the tests failing for you or is it just the hudson bot?, @Mahadev
I will again look into the testcase(run it) and will put my findings., @Mahadev
executed:
./dev-support/test-patch.sh /home/subroto/Desktop/MAPREDUCE-3376.patch --run-tests >> /tmp/patchTest.log

Following is the result for test cases:
{noformat}
    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestLocalDirAllocator
                  org.apache.hadoop.io.retry.TestFailoverProxy
                  org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFileUtil
                  org.apache.hadoop.fs.viewfs.TestViewFsTrash
                  org.apache.hadoop.fs.viewfs.TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem
                  org.apache.hadoop.fs.TestFSMainOperationsLocalFileSystem
{noformat}

The failed testcases are not at all related to patch. May be some env issue. The patch doesn't break any mapred functionality, @Mahadev,
Please let me know if any changes or improvements needs to be made in the patch., The patch looks good to me +1(non-binding)  I reran test-patch myself and the test failures did not show up for me., Submitting the same patch again., I just committed this.
