[Vinod was aware of it and was working on it, I'll take a look., While I was testing with Karam, I worked around it by putting in a null check. We have to come up with a scenario, I couldn't find much from the logs too at that time., With Vinod's help, fixed a corner case where expired/released containers aren't ignored when NM reports back (possibly late).

I'm adding a unit test., The RM should probably exit if the scheduler thread sees exceptions, instead of the RM continuing to run without the scheduler thread. That could be changed here or in a separate jira ?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

 - RNNodeImpl.getStateMachine() isn't used anywhere.
 - The real ContainerID etc are as easy to be created using BuilderUtils.
