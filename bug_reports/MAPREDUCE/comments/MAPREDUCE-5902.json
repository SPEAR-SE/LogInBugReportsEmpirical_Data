[FYI, i categorized this as a bug because, without debug logs - it is impossible to trace certain issues which occur during file collection into the done/ directory, and it is probably an implicit requirement that we should be able to know why certain files would be excluded from being collected., FYI, a concrete example:  These paths, whose job names seem to have been truncated at some point i.e. {{ItemRatingVectorsMappe}} is clearly missing an "R" .......... are not getting picked up by the JobHistoryServer .

{noformat}, After Further investigation, it appears that files with {{ % escape characters }} in them arent picked up by the JobHistoryServer.  I'd like the opinion of one of the JobHistoryServer authors to confirm/deny wether jobnames are indeed allowed to include {{"%"}} signs in them, i.e. {{name%-myName}}.  

Has anyone else seen this before?  I'd be somewhat surprised if I was the only person who has run into it .... I can't imagine its a configuration error of any sort?

The below files appear to be "stuck" in mr-history "purgatory", neither are they detectable as completed jobs from a REST request {{ curl http://10.1.4.138:19888/ws/v1/history/mapreduce/jobs | python -mjson.tool }} to the JobHistoryServer API, **nor** are they ever moved to {{/mr-history/done/}}

{noformat}, This is an identical jira for the web front end, so i think these should be linked, as they are pretty similar and happening in the same component, although at different parts of the stack., Hi Jay! Is % the only special character which causes the jhist files to not be picked up? Could you please try the symbols mentioned in this comment:
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-13?focusedCommentId=12535371&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12535371, Sure I can try those.  

In general what is the contract for a Hadoop file system- should it support any character in a file name ? Are there certain escape sequences that have a particular meaning?, I've confirmed that, this is a FileSystem issue:  I'm using an alternative filesystem, and our plugin behaves differently than HDFS.  we can go back to the original goal for this JIRA:

*When the JobHistoryServer SCANS directories, it should debug log exactly the  files which it sees, so that users can clearly see if certain files arent readable to JHS from just looking at logs.*, I can work on a patch for this ................ general agreement that better logging for this class would be ideal?]
