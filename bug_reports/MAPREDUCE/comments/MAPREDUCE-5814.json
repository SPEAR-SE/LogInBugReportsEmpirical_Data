This message is automatically generated., How about *-site.xml files? Do we support clients sending their site.xml files as part of app submission and overriding the cluster's site.xml files?, Sangjin, I was thinking of this... but *-site.xml unlike job.xml are not meant to be shipped, they are meant to be installed.  default.xml is packaged with hadoop, and can therefore make it into a fat jar. It's a good idea as a defensive measure. The only reason that prevented me from doing this is that the list of such files can be quite long, and include all kinds of log4j and other properties. But they can be legally shipped too. So far I have settled for the least requirement. Looking forward to the pros and cons., Sounds good. I agree users adding *-site.xml files in their jar is such an edge case that I don't think we need to be defensive about that type of scenarios as well. The *-default.xml files can definitely get in via build, but not *-site.xml..., +1 LGTM, Ping: this could use some love. :) Could someone look at this, and commit the patch if you think the patch is good to go? Thanks in advance., The explicit listing of the various default.xml files seems like a reasonable approach.

Has there been any manual testing of the patch?  Since it reformats the system classes for readability it looks like it will not work for org.apache.hadoop. and mapred-default.xml.  Those will now have a newline character and multiple spaces prepended to their names and therefore won't ever match.  We either need to remove whitespace from the value or change MRApps#setJobClassLoader to use conf.getTrimmedStrings instead of conf.getStrings., Thank you for catching the bug [~jlowe]. Fixed and a unit test added., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for updating the patch, Gera.  A couple of nits:

- The test would be better placed in TestMRApps since that corresponds to the class where we fixed the code.  TestMRJobs is kind of a grab-bag of tests that need to run a job with a mini cluster, and this isn't one of those.
- Doing the above would allow us to make MRApps.getSystemClasses package-private instead of public., v03 to address Jason's review. Thanks!, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
