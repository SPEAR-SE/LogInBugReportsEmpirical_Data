[MR's fix (similar to HDFS one)., +1, I grepped to make sure the old names weren't referenced anymore, tried building docs w/o forrest.home set, got expected error. Set forrest.home and built docs successfully without Java5., I am also going to update svn:externals for src/test/bin in 0.21, 0.22 for it is pointing out to the common's trunk rather than to the appropriate common's branches. And with recent changes in test-patch the number of parameters in 0.21 and trunk is different., I have committed this to the trunk and branches 0.21, 0.22. Also, svn:externals src/test were re-pointed in 0.21 and 0.22, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #572 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/572/])
    , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #33 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/33/])
