[This patch fixes the crash.  Now it simply catches the exception and returns that no resources were allocated and continues.  

I tested this manually on a small cluster and verified that works.  I verified when DNS comes back up on the RM starts working and allocating containers again., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The change looks good to me.  I just have two minor comments.

# It is BuilderUtils.newContainerToken that could throw the IllegalArgumentException because of a DNS outage.  It might be good to move the creation of the ContainerTokenIdentifier out of the try block so we don't accidentally treat something else as a DNS issue.  This is mostly because IllegalArgumentException really does not indicate that there was a problem resolving a host name, so I would prefer to reduce the chance of handling the error incorrectly.
# Do we want to log the exception as a string or do we want to pass in the exception as an argument to the log so we get the full stack trace?  In the case of a DNS outage we may not want to fill up the logs with useless messages, but if there is a different error happening I would prefer to have more information to be able to debug it., Thanks for the review Bobby.  

- I'll pull call to ContainerTokenIdentifier out
- yes I meant to pass it. thanks for catching that.
