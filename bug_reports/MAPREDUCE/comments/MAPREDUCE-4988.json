[fix for hadoop 1.1.1.. working on porting the patch to branch1 and trunck, looks like it has already been fixed in branch1 :) , for hadoop 1.1.1 only.. fix is already in branch1, Hi Amir, very sorry but the 1.1.2-rc5 build that passed the release vote, was built on January 31, and was in voting consideration when you posted this, so I didn't notice it.

You can still submit it to branch-1.1 for a potential 1.1.3 release, if you wish.  I won't mark it for 1.2.0 since you said it's already good there.  Thanks.]
