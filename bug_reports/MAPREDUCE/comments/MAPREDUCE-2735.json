[The application summary log is formatted the same as the old job summary log.  example output is:

2011-08-31 16:02:01,237 INFO resourcemanager.RMAppManager$ApplicationSummary: appId=application_1314806486924_1,name=word count,user=user1,queue=default,state=FINISHED,trackingUrl=99.99.99.99:19888/yarn/job/job_1314806486924_1_1,appMasterHost=99.99.99.99,startTime=1314806497546,finishTime=1314806521231

, Thomas, just to clarify - this is in addition (i.e. on RM) to the MR JobSummary log? JobSummary log should be done by the JobHistory server..., yes this is in addition to any job summary log.  This is on the RM when an application completes, it gets recorded here. , Thomas, the patch looks good. Can you please add a descriptive example to log4j.properties so that people know how to configure this on? Thanks., Thanks Arun.  Sure I can add an example, you want it in the one at  ./hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/conf/log4j.properties?, Yes, thanks., added example to common log4j.properties.  Hopefully it doesn't complain since its in common and not mapreduce directory., I just committed this. Thanks Tom!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #900 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/900/])
