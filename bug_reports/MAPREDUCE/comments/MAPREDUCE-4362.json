[As I noted one MAPREDUCE-3889
bq. But the problem is that the client doesn't have a way of mapping TaskAttemptId to the ContainerIDs so that the log-urls can be constructed properly. So may be for the shorter term, we can disable the feature completely.

May be we should add an API to ClientProtocol to get this? Thoughts?, I agree, it should not be that hard to abstract away how we grab the logs, I thought there was already something like that in yarn logs, so it should not be too difficult if we know the container id and application state to get the logs back., ClientProtocol already has a {{getLogFileParams(JobID jobID, TaskAttemptID taskAttemptID)}} - which is used by the MR CLI to fetch logs. This should be usable., Good. Forgot that we added this for dumping logs via JHS. We can use it then., Uploaded a patch that uses the LogParams to fetch the logs.  Container logs were only available through the NM web UI, with HTML formatting, so I added a call to the REST API that returns them in plain text., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Sandy, please file a YARN ticket for the YARN changes and summarize, upload your patch there. Let's first get in those changes and then do the MR specific ones here.

This new code needs to consolidate with what is already there in ContainerLogsPage - there is other related code like security that we neither want to miss nor duplicate. Clearly, there are issues with the patch I want to be fixed, let's continue this discussion on YARN JIRA.

Thanks., Filed and submitted patch to YARN-649, Sandy, can you rebase this patch? We need to remove the YARN changes as YARN-649 is in. May be some tests too?, Attaching a rebased patch with only the MR changes, using the URL format supported by YARN-649.  It's not ready - when I try to test it out on a pseudodistributed cluster, the NM is failing to locate the container requested by the MR client.

I don't have a ton of bandwidth to work on this at the moment, so anyone should feel free to pick it up., Hey, [~sandyr]. I'll pick it up., {{writeTaskLogs}} will NPE if the finally logic gets called before {{input}} is assigned; {{IOUtils.closeQuietly()}} needs to be used]
