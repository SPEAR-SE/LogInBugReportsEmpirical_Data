[Looking at validateCopy in trunk tells me that it does not seem to check anything beyond the crc (if available, and if asked for) and the length of whole files. That doesn't seem to be a cause for a failure due to differing block sizes here?, I can confirm -pb solves this problem:

During the first run many files fail. When i retry most files are skipped because they were already copied and a few files succeed. With a third try all files fail consistently. When i finally try again with -pb set all files are copied properly and thus solves this problem.]
