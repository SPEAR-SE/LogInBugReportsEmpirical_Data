It appears that the file visibility is different on the Apache Jenkins host than on my local machine! I just wanted to demonstrate that ClientDistributedCacheManager.determineCacheVisibilities() threw the IllegalArgumentException before and succeeds with my change; I don't need to assert that the visibility is any specific value., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., HADOOP-10876 is reverted. , [~kkambatl], with the revert of HADOOP-10876, the change to ClientDistributedCacheManager is no longer needed (although works fine with the revert). However, the unit test could still be useful, since there was no test for ClientDistributedCacheManager.determineCacheVisibilities() before; the test is very simple and does not do much, but it could detect the problem caused by something like HADOOP-10876. I can submit a new patch with just the test, if you think that is still of interest.
, Agree that the test is useful. Looking at the patch again, I am actually tempted to leave the fix in there as well since it is benign. , Yes, the change to ClientDistributedCacheManager itself does not hurt anything.
Let me know if you'd like me to submit a new patch with just the test.

, Looked more closely this time. I propose we keep the test and a modified fix. Comments on the patch:
# For the fix, don't think we need another method. Why not change the call to getFileStatus as follows:
{code}
    FileStatus status = getFileStatus(fs, path, statCache); // change the second parameter to path.toUri()
{code}
# IIUC, the test verifies the behavior only for cases where TEST_ROOT_DIR begins with CURRENT_DIR. In other cases, we don't verify the behavior we want to verify. Is that right? If so, is there a way to verify it always? May be, create a custom TEST_ROOT_DIR under CURRENT_DIR and delete it in a cleanup method? , Karthik,
in ClientDistributedCacheManager.java before my change. there was a getFileStatus static method with signature getFileStatus(Configuration, URI, Map<URI, FileStatus>). It was called in one method, determineTimestamps (where it's called 4 times) and it called getFileStatus(FileSystem, URI, Map<URI, FileStatus>) to do the work. In addition, getFileStatus(FileSystem, URI, Map<URI, FileStatus>) was also called by checkPermissionOfOther (once).
In determineTimestamps, there are only URIs, not Paths. So it is not natural to convert the URIs to Paths (by doing new Path(uri)) and then call a getFileStatus method with a Path parameter, where it then converts the Path back to a URI (path.toUri()) before looking it up in the cache. In checkPermissionOfOther, however, there is a Path to begin with, hence it made sense to call a getFileStatus method with a Path parameter.
I thought hard about how to make my change without duplicating code, but I didn't see any easy way to do it.
I can implement your suggestion, so that getFileStatus(Configuration, URI, Map<URI, FileStatus>) calls getFileStatus(FileSystem, Path, Map<URI, FileStatus>) - getting rid of getFileStatus(FileSystem, URI, Map<URI, FileStatus>) - but that means converting URIs to Paths and then back to URIs for the cache lookup.

As to your second point, in practice, the way the project is built (from maven), TEST_ROOT_DIR is always CURRENT_DIR + "target/test-dir/". So, secondCacheFile is always a relative Path,. In case the test is run differently, e.g., the system property test.build.data is not set by the build (so defaults to /tmp) or set to something else, a valid secondCacheFile is still constructed, and both the tests are still valid; they just won't test a relative Path. I didn't want to just do
{noformat}
    secondCacheFile = new Path("secondcachefile");
{noformat}
as I didn't want to pollute the project directory.
, Karthik, it is possible I misread your first point. I'm not sure what you intended then.
