[I'm not sure this is a good idea. TT are restarted for not reporting status for 10 minutes. That should *not* reset the blacklist status. It should probably count as a strike against that TT., I think the reporter is no longer around, but I'll ask anyway, just in case:

(1) Is the first issue still a problem?  From inspection of the code, it appears that it should work (that is, restarted trackers are considered healthy, though their previous "faults" aren't erased).

(2) Clarification of the second issue:  does "try to blacklist other TT" refer to another TT on one of the previously blacklisted (25%) nodes or to a TT on one of the never-blacklisted (75%) nodes?
