[As I mentioned in MAPREDUCE-5668, JIRA is not the avenue to use for questions like this.  Please use the [user@ mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User] for questions like this.  If after discussing on the mailing list it ends up being a bug in Hadoop then a JIRA can be filed at that time.

This is clearly a case of code being compiled against a release after 1.x but then run on a 0.20 or 1.x release.  The FileStatus.isDirectory() method was not present in the 0.20 or 1.x releases.  We cannot generally support compiling code against a later release and then running it on an earlier release because of new APIs that can be added.]
