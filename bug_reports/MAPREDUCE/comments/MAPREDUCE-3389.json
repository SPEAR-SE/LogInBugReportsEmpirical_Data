[As far as I remember, it was mainly being used for testing. Ill check and update., Mahadev,

OK. But even then is an issue when used by for testing by downstream projects, correct?, *IMPORTANT: This fix is a temporary solution until the classpath for the AM and the Tasks is generated in a more general way*

The current implementation assumes the mrapp-generated-classpath file is in a JAR file in the classpath (for seeing it for the tasks environment)

This patch enables handling the case that the mrapp-generated-classpath file is in an expanded directory in the classpath.

In addition, it sets the the classpath element containing the mrapp-generated-classpath first in the classpath, instead of at the end.

These changes enable downstream projects (like pig) to seed their  mrapp-generated-classpath using their current build classpath. They can do that by creating a mrapp-generated-classpath file with their current classpath in the root dir of their test classes directory.

This message is automatically generated., Sadly, I cant think of a cleaner quick fix for now. Lets go with this for now unless a clean soln pops up., Mahadev, thanks for looking into this. I'll commit this to trunk and branch-0.23 momentarily. I'll open a new JIRA for a permanent fix., same patch, generated without the a/ b/ prefix., committed to trunk and branch-23, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1365 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1365/])
