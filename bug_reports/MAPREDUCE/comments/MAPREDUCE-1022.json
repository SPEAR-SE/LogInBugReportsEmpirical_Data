[As Ravi pointed offline, this is due to the wrong package name for JobContextImpl used in TestVertical.java. Changing it to org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.task.JobContextImpl does the trick. Attaching a patch., Why is JobContextImpl under mapreduce/task/  directory ? Should it be under mapreduce/  ?, Sorry if I'm missing some context here, but I'm wondering how this class get into a different package and why that hasn't been caught before?, bq. Sorry if I'm missing some context here, but I'm wondering how this class get into a different package and why that hasn't been caught before? 
This was caused by MAPREDUCE-775. The contributor made it Patch Available and Hudson blessed it on Sep 13 and the patch got committed on Sep 19 without it going through Hudson again. Mean while, MAPREDUCE-777 went in breaking this patch. Ideally MAPREDUCE-775 should have been run through Hudson again, but this case it wasn't done (perhaps due to the Feature Freeze date pressure, perhaps)., So, in other words contributors (nor committers reviewing the patch) bother to whole test cycle on their own and Hudson became our very last line of defense?

It seems to me that while Hudson can only do so much we are likely to be getting broken commits unless we'll raise the bar of the quality of the submissions., This new classes were introduced by MAPREDUCE-954, but I ran 'ant jar-test' which didn't seem to catch it - not sure why. I'm going to commit this., bq. but I ran 'ant jar-test' which didn't seem to catch it

Sorry, that was 'ant tar' - and the problem was MAPREDUCE-1031..., I just committed this. Thanks, Vinod!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #61 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/61/])
