[Stumbled on this while discussing with [~rohini] on random things in MRV2 ;)

We can one of the couple of things:
 - MR AMs could go through a separate http proxy inside the cluster to which network ACLs can permit trips to outside world.
 - We could overload the web-proxy that we already have in ResourceManager for this purpose.
Either way we need to fix MR AM to use a http proxy configuration., Attaching a patch to enable the configuration of an HTTP Proxy.

This message is automatically generated., Adding support for configuring SOCKS proxy. By default it assumes HTTP proxy., The findbugs warning (org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.launcher.ContainerRemoteLaunchEvent defines equals but not hashCode) is unrelated to this patch. The same patch also applies to trunk

This message is automatically generated., Looks good to me. +1. Pushing this in.

Orthogonal issue: The job-end-notification related params don't seem to be following the naming pattern of other configs. Will file a separate ticket., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.
