[Good catch Thomas. 

Thankfully this isn't super-critical because 'usedCapacity' is used nowhere other than displaying queue-stats to clients i.e. it doesn't runtime behaviour of the CapacityScheduler.

I need to look more, but trying this patch out always seems to yield 0% used capacity (according to webui). 

What is meant to be the difference between used capacity and utilization?

Also note that there is a big log statement in setupQueueConfigs, that prints the formulas on how these are calculated so we would want to change that to match., Findbugs caught the 'usedCapacity=0' problem... integral division! :), +1 overall.

I was misunderstanding what usedCapacity meant, but I think I now understand, although I don't think the current formula for used Capacity works in all cases.  Please correct me if I’m off on the definition here. I believe used Capacity is meant to be what % of the parent am I using. Similar to how capacity/max capacity apply to the parent.   I expected usedCapacity to be what utilization is defined as, which is what I thought users will be interested in -> how much of the resources normally allocated to my queue (absoluteCapacity) am I using right now. I think Utilization = absoluteUsedCapacity.   

Is a user normally really going to care what % of my parent queue they are using? To me the absoluteCapacity is what I’m interested in because my queue has X amount of memory allocated to it, and I have Y left. 
I can see admins being interested in the used Capacity as they can quickly see what percent of the parent is being used by the various leaf queues.

right now definitions are:
utilization = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * absoluteCapacity)
usedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * capacity)

Here is an example, which I believe demonstrates usedCapacity being off - lets say cluster has 32G memory total:

Queue definitions:
root - capacity = absoluteCapacity = 100% - 32G
root.a - capacity=50%, absoluteCap = 100*50=50% - 16G
root.a.a1 - capacity = 50%, absoluteCap = (100*50)*50 = 25% - 8G
root.a.a2 - capacity = 50%, absoluteCap = (100*50)*50% = 25% - 8G
root.b - capacity = 20%, absoluteCap = 100*20=20% - 6.4G
root.b.b1 - capacity = 60%, absoluteCap = 100*20%*60% = 12%, MaxCap = -1 (lets me go over my capacity) = 3.84G
root.c - capacity = 30%, absoluteCap = 100*30=30% - 9.6G
root.c.c1 - capacity = 75%, absoluteCap = 100*30%*75* = 22.5% = 7.2G


Now I start a job that uses 4G submitted to a1.
root used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G
root.a used = 4/(32*.5) = 25%, utilization = 4/(32*.5) = 25% = 4G of 16G
root.a.a1 used = 4/(32 *.5) = 25%, utilization = 4/(32*.25) = 50% => this just happens to work because capacity = parent asoluteCap

job in a1 finishes. now start a job that uses 4G submitted to b1
root used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G
root.b used = 4/(32*.2) = 62.5%, utilization = 4/(32*.2) = 62.5% = 4G of 6.4G
root.b.b1 used = 4/(32 *.6) = 20.8% (4G of 6.4G ??), utilization = 4/(32*.12) = 104% (4G of 3.84G) 

the 20.8% doesn't make sense to me?  I'm using 4G of my parents 6.4G - that should be 62.5%.  

job in a1 finishes. now start a job that uses 4G submitted to c1
root used = 4/(32 * 1) = 12.5%, utilization= 4/(32*1) = 12.5% = 4G of 32G
root.c used = 4/(32*.3) = 41.6%, utilization = 4/(32*.3) = 41.6% = 4G of 9.6G
root.c.c1 used = 4/(32 *.75) = 16.6% (4G of 9.6G ??), utilization = 4/(32*.225) = 55.5% (4G of 7.2G) 

Again the 16.6% I think is wrong as it should be 4G of the 9.6G or 41.6%

I think the formula should be 
usedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * parent.getAbsoluteCapacity())
, I had made the updates for 
usedCapacity = usedResources.getMemory() / (clusterResource.getMemory() * parent.getAbsoluteCapacity())
