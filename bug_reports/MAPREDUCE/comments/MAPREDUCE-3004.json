[Good one to fix.

We should check for mapreduce.framework.name == classic and mapreduce.job.tracker == local to assume local mode in ReduceTask., Changed ReduceTask to check both framework name and master address to determine if local, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Ran the sort example manually wihout specifying a job tracker address in the mapred config. Not sure if there is a simple way to enable a automated test for this case., Cancelling patch to modify integration tests to cover this scenario. , Providing a new patch which modifies testSleepJob in TestMRJobs to modify the master address to local. Tested to ensure the  unit test fails without the patched code in ReduceTask. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good.

Minor nits:
# Pass is default value to 'classic' rather than do the null check
# Define 'classic' as a constant in MRConfig., Addressing code review comments. Added 2 constants to MRConfig to reference classic and yarn framework names instead of using hardcoded strings. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
