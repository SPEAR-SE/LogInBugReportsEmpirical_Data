this patch WAS unit tests. 1 unit test, one new class (to facilitate testing), and one test for the new class., better patch coming , A      src/test/org/apache/hadoop/examples

A      src/test/org/apache/hadoop/examples/OutputCollectorHelper.java, Same as ticket except things have been moved into

This message is automatically generated., how ironic. I'll see why it failed this but not locally and resubmit., failed it's own test. will investigate fix and resubmit. It did pass before submitting..., Fixed key ordering bug in previous patch, unit tests should pass in every environment now. 
added getInjectedKeyAt (...) and getInjectedValueAt(...) to OutputCollectorHelper, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Sorry to come to this so late, but I would vote to use a mock object library (jMock) to write tests for mappers and reducers as you argued for on the user list (http://www.mail-archive.com/hadoop-user@lucene.apache.org/msg02261.html). Using jMock is much more concise than the approach in this patch (see http://www.matthewekent.com/?p=15), although I admit it does have a bit of a learning curve., Cancelling the patch for this bug since Tom has a comment on the approach taken to address the issue. , Resolving this since it has gone stale. Please re-open if this is still required.

(P.s. Hadoop uses Mockito for tests now, if its required to note.)]
