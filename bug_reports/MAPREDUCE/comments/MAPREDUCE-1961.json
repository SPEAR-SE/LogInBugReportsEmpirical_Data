[It seems that StatsCollectorThread is still active when we call "clusterStatlisteners.clear();" from "Statistics.shutdown()".

A simple fix is to replace "clusterStatlisteners.clear();" with "lusterStatlisteners = new ArrayList<StatListener<ClusterStats>>()".

While we are at it, we probably should also fix the same problem with jobStatListeners., Trivial patch that uses CopyOnWriteArrayList to avoid concurrent modification. No unit test included as it is hard to reproduce the synchronization bug through unit tests., retry hudson, +1 for the patch., test-patch output:

The patch fixes a concurrency bug, and is hard to write unit test to cover. The patch is tested with real benchmark runs and has shown to be effective.
