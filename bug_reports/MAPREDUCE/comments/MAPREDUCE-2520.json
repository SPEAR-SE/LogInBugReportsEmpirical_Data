[Which version of Hadoop are you using? I don't see this error in [0.20|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.20/src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/InputSampler.java], [0.21|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/mapreduce/branches/branch-0.21/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/partition/InputSampler.java], or [trunk|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/mapreduce/trunk/src/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/lib/partition/InputSampler.java]., 20.2_320, I do not see this in [0.20.203|http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.20-security-203/src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/lib/InputSampler.java], either., We're running from a tarball distribution at my organization.

The src softlink in the main Hadoop directory points to a "cloudera/hadoop-0.20.2+320" directory.  In the 
root directory there are several jar files with names like hadoop-*-0.20.2+320.jar., I see. This doesn't appear to be a bug in Hadoop, so I'm going to close this. You should contact the vendor for a fix to that code or download the latest stable release from Apache: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/releases.html, My guess is that someone at your organization has applied a local patch - that code doesn't appear anywhere in any version of InputSampler I'm aware of (the cloudera release you're referring to is primarily made up of patches backported from the Apache trunk)]
