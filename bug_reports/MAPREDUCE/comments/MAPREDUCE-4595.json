[Uploading a patch for branch-1.

I understand it is not the absolute fool approach, as the test still fails if the thread moving the file takes longer than 5 minutes. However, it is a cause of concern if it takes longer than that.

Please feel free to suggest alternate/better approaches., * I meant fool proof approach in my previous comment.

With the patch, the test passes, in the presence of the sleep in JobHistoryFilesManager#run() as in the force-failure patch., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12542627/MR-4595.patch
  against trunk revision .

    -1 patch.  The patch command could not apply the patch.
