[Adding support for HADOOP_TOKEN_FILE_LOCATION being interpreted as a comma-separated list of paths to delegation token files., Same patch, this time with -p0., Removed some log output that shouldn't have been included. Apologies for the noise., mapred_tutorial.xml needs to be updated to read comma separated since that's what's being done in HADOOP-6988.  Otherwise looks good.

Not introduced in your change but "mapreduce.job.credentials.binary" should be defined MRJobConfig, if people don't mind would be good to clean that up here.
, Thanks for the review, Eli. I've updated the patch to address your comments., What is the use case? I can't seem to find one here or in HADOOP-6988 ... thanks., Hi Arun,

Several possible use cases are described in HADOOP-6988, but to summarize:

It's presently possible to fetch delegation tokens to files, and to pass these to bin/hadoop when submitting a job. I'd like to be able to specify both MR and HDFS delegation token files upfront so that job submission (eg done by Hue or Hive) doesn't require using kinit. This change could also be useful to pass delegation token files obtained from multiple distinct NNs.]
