[I attached a patch YARN-4187.000.patch which use YarnConfiguration instead of JobConf(Configuration) to call {{getSocketAddr}}, because Configuration.getSocketAddr won't support RM HA. Also we need check whether RM_HA_ID is configured, if RM_HA_ID is not configured, the first one in RM_HA_IDS will be used, otherwise it will fall back to use the client local address., \\

This message was automatically generated., Moved the JIRA from YARN to MapReduce since all the changes are in Map Reduce project., Thanks for the patch, [~zxu].. Makes sense..

Minor nit :
Instead of using {{yarnConf.getStringCollection()}} and then doing an {{rmIds.toArrays()}}, you can probably just use {{yarnConf.getStrings()}} which returns an array itself.

+1, pending that
, thanks for the review [~asuresh]! That is a good suggestion. I attached a new patch MAPREDUCE-6484.001.patch, which addressed your comment., The latest patch looks good.. thanks [~zxu]

+1, pending jenkins, \\

, [~asuresh] [~zxu] It seems like the getMasterAddress() functionality ideally belongs in YARN and not in MR so that other applications that make use of YARN can always leverage the same functionality. Would you agree? , I feel this is useful only to MR. Correct me if im wrong, but I believe this is used specifically by the mapreduce TokenCache and JobRunner. I also believe {{ClientRMProxy}} handles this correctly when it does a _getTokenService_ . [~zxu], Thoughts ?, [~asuresh] thanks for the pointer. Any reason why MR does not use that function in that case? ]
