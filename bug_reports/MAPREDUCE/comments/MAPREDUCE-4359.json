This message is automatically generated., Patch looks good to me. If this is in trunk we should do a trunk patch at the same time, though., The counters code is different in trunk since MAPREDUCE-901 so this change doesn't apply. We should do a separate jcarder run for trunk though., Gotcha. +1, then., I just committed this. (I ran unit tests and test-patch and both looked OK.), Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
