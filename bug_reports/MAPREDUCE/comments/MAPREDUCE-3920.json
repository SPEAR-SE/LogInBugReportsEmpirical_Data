This message is automatically generated., Unit test TestNodeID was testing comparison operations between port numbers. That comparison test was based on hard coded values.  I adjusted the hard coded values so that they again test the comparison operations they intended.  I'll resubmit patch., Same patch, but with fix for TestNodeId unit test (port number comparison operator test)., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Mostly looks good. Since no one has spoken up with objections I don't see any harm in changing these as a user can always override.  

A couple minor nits.  I think the following files don't need to change as they aren't changing port numbers, just values that happen to be value that match one of the ports you changed.  Can you remove those from the patch?

- hadoop-mapreduce-project/src/test/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/filecache/TestTrackerDistributedCacheManager.java, Nice. Good to see the doc changes. +1 for the change, havent reviewed the patch though!, I was hesitant to second guess the original authors choice of picking an identical number of 4344 for what appeared a random size allocation, as the yarn nodemanager localization port in those unit tests.  While benign, I do agree, that change shouldn't be necessary.   I'll change those tests back and resubmit.
, Could someone please update the target version of this JIRA? 0.23.1 doesn't seem appropriate, since it's already been released.

In particular, I'm curious if this will be targeted for 0.23.2 or 0.23.3., Same patch, minus changes to test files mentioned by Tom, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
