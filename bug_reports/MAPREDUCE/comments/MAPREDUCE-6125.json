This message is automatically generated., Thanks for updating the patch, Mit.  Comments:

There should be a comment with ContainerManagementProtocolWithClose explaining why it's necessary, and ContainerManagementProtocolClient might be a better name.

ContainerManagementProtocolWithClose should be an interface rather than an abstract class.  Removes the need to write all those unused stubs.  We can let the concrete classes provide the close method.

Override annotations were removed and should be restored.

Adding Public and Stable annotations to the mock class for test is not necessary or really applicable to a unit test

ContainerManagementProtocolPB and ContainerManagementProtocolPBClientImpl imports were added but are unused.
