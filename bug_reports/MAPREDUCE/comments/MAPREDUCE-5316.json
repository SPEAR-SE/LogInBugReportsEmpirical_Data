[I've added code to validate task-state and print error/usage messages for invalid input.
There is a small catch here- branch-23 didn't have any validation code for
checking task-states,while trunk had one. However,in trunk, the validation code threw an exception. I've modified trunk as well to print error/usage message rather than throw an exception,so that we have consistent behavior across branches. Also,I've made task-state case-insensitive., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
