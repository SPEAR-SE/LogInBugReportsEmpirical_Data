[The code looks like it will only try to connect so many times before giving up, but there's a bug in LocalContainerAllocator.heartbeat:

{code:title=LocalContainerAllocator.heartbeat}
AllocateResponse allocateResponse = scheduler.allocate(allocateRequest);
AMResponse response;
try {
  response = allocateResponse.getAMResponse();
  // Reset retry count if no exception occurred.
  retrystartTime = System.currentTimeMillis();
} catch (Exception e) {
{code}

Note that the try block is surrounding the retrieval of the response *after* the {{allocate}} RPC call, so we're missing where the exception is really being thrown and not handling it here where it has retry count logic.  The exception then bubbles up to the RMCommunicator allocator thread where if the exception isn't a {{YarnException}} then it simply loops around to try again, forever., Patch to fix the try block in the heartbeat method so we catch the exceptions being thrown when trying to contact the RM and can handle them for retry logic properly., The code looks good to me.  My only comment is with the test.  If a different exception is thrown, that exception is eaten and it is likely to be difficult to debug the error.  If you could log it some how that would be great., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Of course, I should have just let the exception bubble up and fail the test directly rather than catching and failing.  Updated patch accordingly., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
