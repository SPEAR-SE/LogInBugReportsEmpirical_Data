[I have just found that rehashes contents from another JIRA
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3169... and there is a MiniMRYarnCluster in fact in the mapreduce package.

So.. then... Is MiniMRCluster an artifact of the MR1 days that will be less used once MR2 takes over ? 

Is MiniMrYarnCluster a generic version of MiniMRCluster which will one day obviate the implementation specific MiniMRCluster altogether for the Hadoop-MapReduce jobs that are implemented in the MR2 YARN framework? , MiniMRCluster has been added to Hadoop2 to enabled backward compatibility for downstream projects that used Hadoop1 MiniMRCluster in their testcases. In other words, to support legacy stuff.

If you are starting something from scratch you should use the new MiniMRYarnCluster directly.

IMO, I'd close this JIRA as not-a-problem., +1 to close, but the deprecation story is somewhat tricky not sure how to improve it.  Maybe just a wiki page update to http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/HowToContribute to explain the changes to MRMiniCluster would be in order here, or something. , MiniMRClientClusterFactory should be used instead of using MiniMRCluster or MiniMRYarnCluster.]
