[A quick look at the JobInProgress code says "In JobInProgress.findSpeculativeTask(), tip.isRunnable() check is not done,
whereas the method JobInProgress.findTaskFromList() does the check to skip failed/killed tips".

The bug is not there in 0.21 or trunk (got fixed in HADOOP:2141), it is there only in branch 0.20., The above code bug is also responsible for some corner case issues because of which a job never finishes. We saw some scenarios in which speculative attempts get launched and get killed immediately in the order of seconds. This happens continuously for ever and the job never ends., Attaching YDH patch by Arun (patch does what comment suggests above), Likely fixed.]
