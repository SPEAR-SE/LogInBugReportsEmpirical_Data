[That is interesting. We are seeing the same on 0.22 when running in dev mode. When things are packaged up and deployed this error does not occur., I believe this problem only exists when running hadoop from separate folders (common, hdfs, mapreduce).  I think it should be fixed as part of the mavenization of MRv1 in HADOOP-7590., I cannot reproduce this on the latest hadoop. 
This is also possibly because the tarball and dist comes in a single folder (instead of separate ones for common,hdfs, and mapreduce). Reducing the priority and closing this for now. If this comes up again, will reopen then.]
