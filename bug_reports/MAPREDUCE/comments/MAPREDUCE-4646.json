[Patch to add diagnostics to the job report.  Manually tested with a fail job, and the client now sees something useful, e.g.:

This message is automatically generated., Good catch, Jason.

Can you fix {{MRBuilderUtils.newJobReport()}} itself to also take in a diagnostics instead of doing an explicit setDiagnostics?

Also, you can send a {{JobDiagnosticsUpdateEvent}} itself instead of an addDiagnostics() in the test-case., Thanks for the review, Vinod.  I've updated the patch accordingly., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
