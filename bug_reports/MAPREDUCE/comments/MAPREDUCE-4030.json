[Nishan - can u pls check reducer log and AM log to verify if the AM was notified of the map and it was re-run? That should happen before the reduce bailed out. Thanks., I dont't see any log which is notifying to the AM about map output copy fail in the reducer and relaunching the map task by the AM in AM log, Hi Nishan, Before the reducer bailing out, it will check the health and progress using these below conditions

1. failureCounts.size() >= maxFailedUniqueFetches or failureCounts.size() == (totalMaps - doneMaps)

2. reducerHealthy ((totalFailures / (totalFailures + doneMaps)) < 0.5f)

3. reducerProgressed is not enough Enough((doneMaps / totalMaps) < 0.5f ) or reducerStalled

I think it has run all or most of the maps in the down node and satisfied the above conditions and then reducer failed without re-running the maps in your case. 

Can you please check and confirm whether the same case happened in your env?
