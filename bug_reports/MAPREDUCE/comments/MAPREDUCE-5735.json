# if it doesn't occur in Hadoop 2.2 then can you upgrade and see if it does.
# S3 isn't a filesystem, it's a blob store, and some aspects of MR operation just don't work as they would against HDFS. Why not try writing to HDFS and then copying out the results?
# that said, if the problem does remain in S3 on Hadoop 2.2+, then this could be a bug -in which case a unit test to replicate it would be a good start to fixing it, Steve, Thanks for your response.

- I am using cdh4.4(It uses Hadoop 2.0)
-So, I assume that MultipleOutput of Hadoop 2.0 doesnt work with s3.
, Steve,
Like you said I have tried it on Hadoop 2.2.0. And its still the same. I am not getting the output.]
