[Two more methods that need cleanup:
 - createSymlink()/getSymlink() can better deal with boolean input/output. This will be cleaner and also will support its reset for example., I don't see how this is a blocker.  Removing from 0.22., Would be a good one to get in a 23.x release., Can we get MAPREDUCE-1744 in 0.23 as a stop-gap until MAPREDUCE-950 takes care in a more comprehensive way? OOZIE-638 requires this, else Oozie has edge failures when interacting with a cluster with security ON, depending on what HDFS operation was performed first (and if a FS handle is available in the cache), Ping!

I suspect this is stale, but it'd be good to get someone more familiar with the issue to close it.
