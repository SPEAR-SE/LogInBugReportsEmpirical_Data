[Thanks to Siddarth Seth for the analysis on this issue.  He discovered that the RM is not filling out the application ACLs on the response to ApplicationMasterService.registerApplicationMaster.  The RM is responsible for setting up the app ACLs on the node that runs the AM container, but the ACLs for all the tasks are set via container requests from the AM.  Since the AM doesn't know the proper ACLs, any node *other* than the node the AM is running on will have no ACLs for the app and the corresponding task logs will be recorded without ACLs.  When the history server tries to serve up these logs, the lack of ACLs causes it to fall back to the default and only allows access from the app owner and admins.

Logs for tasks that ran on the same node as the AM work since the node had the proper ACLs setup by the RM.  This explains why it was never seen on a single-node cluster and why some tasks can be seen and others can't for the same application.

Thanks again to Siddarth!
