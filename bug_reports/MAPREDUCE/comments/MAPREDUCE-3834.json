This message is automatically generated., Looking at this for review/commit., Looks good overall. Very minor nits:
 - I was confused by the test as to how the hosts all get resolved to the same rack. May be you can comment that they resolve to the default rack.
 - when you do a racks.toArray(new String[0]), you could instead do racks.toArray(new String[racks.size()]). The underlying code does the resizing immediately, we could as well give the correct size., Done. Thanks for the review., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
