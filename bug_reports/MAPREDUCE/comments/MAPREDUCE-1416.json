[Others please add on to the list if you feel more need to be added. Can some committer who has authority to modify the list do the same? Thanks., I think I have the rights. Let me see, OK, the new entries are in and show up when you file new bugs. I will add any more people add. For each one can you list

-the string you want for the jira entry
-any text to describe it
-the JIRA account ID of anyone you want to lead a component (and rx/ the bug reports, this is handy for contrib/ sections)

I will leave it to anyone to move existing defects into the components; and leave this issue open until we are happy with the set

Also, Are the current components with explicit leads up to date? We can alter them

* contrib/capacity-sched (Lead: Hemanth Yamijala)
* contrib/eclipse-plugin (Lead: Christophe Taton)
* contrib/fair-share (Lead: Matei Zaharia)
* contrib/gridmix (Lead: Chris Douglas)
* contrib/mumak (Lead: Hong Tang)
* contrib/sqoop (Lead: Aaron Kimball)
* contrib/vertica (Lead: Omer Trajman)
* distcp (Lead: Tsz Wo (Nicholas), SZE)
* harchive (Lead: Mahadev konar)
* test (Lead: Nigel Daley), Thanks Steve for creating the new ones!

I don't have a whole lot of idea about the leads of these projects. I'll let them chip in themselves to specify the relevant information. Thanks!]
