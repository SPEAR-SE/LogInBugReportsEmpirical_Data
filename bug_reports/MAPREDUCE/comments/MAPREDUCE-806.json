[Hello
I have this problem but with hadoop-0.21.0 version. On this version, how is the correct compilation? I search  commons-cli-2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar in this version but don't exist.
Thank you, I am having the same issue. There is no jar exist with the above name., The file you are looking for in hadoop-0.21.0 is in HADOOP_HOME/lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar It is not ver 2.0 but worked for me., Thanks. That helped.
$ pwd
/home/abhay/sandbox/hadoop-0.20.203.0

$ find * -iname commons-cli-*.jar
lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar

$ javac -cp hadoop-core-0.20.203.0.jar:lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar -d playground/classes playground/src/WordCount.java

And it compiled fine! , Can we mark this resolved?, i came across here as i happened to be facing the same problem.
everything goes well after i followed the instruction here(no errors after this), but i cant see any wordcount.jar created..

javac -classpath /home/hadoop/hadoop/hadoop-core-1.0.3.jar:/home/hadoop/hadoop/lib/commons-cli-1.2.jar -d classes src/WordCount.java

i only have the following classes created.
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hadoop hadoop 1790 Aug  7 15:42 WordCount$TokenizerMapper.class
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hadoop hadoop 1789 Aug  7 15:42 WordCount$IntSumReducer.class
-rw-rw-r-- 1 hadoop hadoop 1911 Aug  7 15:42 WordCount.class

sorry, i am not familiar with java, can someone tell me if my compiling is correct?

thank you.
, sorry, i missed out the jar command....

, Almost certainly stale. Please file a new jira if you are still encountering this issue.]
