This message is automatically generated., Hey B Anil Kumar, 

Thanks for the patch.  It looks good other then the test failures. Can you update TestRMWebServices (function verifyClusterSchedulerFifoGeneric) to expect 0 instead of the NaN now?  

A very minor nit if you want to fix is Scheduler is misspelled in the test function title: testFifoSchedularCapacityWhenNoNMs



As a side note this also fixes the mapred queue -info output:

with patch:
$ mapred queue -info default
======================
Queue Name : default 
Queue State : running 
Scheduling Info : Capacity: 100.0, MaximumCapacity: 1.0, CurrentCapacity: 0.0 


without:
$ mapred queue -info default
======================
Queue Name : default 
Queue State : running 
Scheduling Info : Capacity: 100.0, MaximumCapacity: 1.0, CurrentCapacity: NaN 
, Thanks for the inputs Thomas.

I am unable to cancel my previous patch. Attaching new patch.
