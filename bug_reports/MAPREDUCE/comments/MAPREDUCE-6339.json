This message was automatically generated., Change it to a critical issue because we saw a MR job whose AM container is killed and  two hours event records are missing in the job history file., [~zxu], Can you look into this checkstyle issue in the patch?
{code:xml}
-1	checkstyle	3m 58s	The applied patch generated 1 additional checkstyle issues.
{code}, thanks [~devaraj.k] for the review, I am not sure what cause the checkstyle issue. I uploaded a new patch, which fix 80-column-limit violations at line 259 of JobHistoryEventHandler.java., \\

This message was automatically generated., I did several tests with different patches. The behavior from checkstyle is strange. It even reports the checkstyle issues from the file I didn't touch. So It looks like my first patch MAPREDUCE-6339.000.patch didn't introduce any new  checkstyle issues., \\

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~devaraj.k], Just let you know the second patch MAPREDUCE-6339.001.patch is used to test checkstyle.
The first patch MAPREDUCE-6339.000.patch is the one for review and commit. I didn't find any code style issue in my first patch MAPREDUCE-6339.000.patch. It looks like something wrong in the checkstyle script., \\

This message was automatically generated., The last Jenkins run didn't have checkstyle issue. The only difference between these two patches is an import statement:
{code}
import com.google.common.annotations.VisibleForTesting;
{code}
It looks like the import statement causes this checkstyle issue. But this import statement  looks good to me.
Don't know why the checkstyle script report this issue. So it looks like a script issue.

This message was automatically generated., The two test patches MAPREDUCE-6339.test.patch and MAPREDUCE-6339.test1.patch is to prove this is most likely a checkstyle script issue. The only difference between MAPREDUCE-6339.test.patch and MAPREDUCE-6339.test1.patch is an import statement, which doesn't look like an issue for me.
The original patch MAPREDUCE-6339.000.patch is the one for review and commit

, Thanks [~zxu] for your effort on identifying the checkstyle issue.

MAPREDUCE-6339.000.patch looks good to me, will commit it soon., Thanks [~zxu].
