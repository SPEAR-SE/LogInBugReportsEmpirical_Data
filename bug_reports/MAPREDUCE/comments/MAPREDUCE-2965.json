This message is automatically generated., The patch looks fine overall. Some comments:
 - We can reuse the NumberFormat definitions for various IDs, no need to repeat them in each class.
 - Several needed null-checks are missing in {{toString()}} and {{comparesTo()}} methods in all the IDs.
 - Looks like after your adding the licenses to the two tests, the allowed rat-warnings can be set to zero in dev-support/test-patch.properties.

It just occurred to me that the way we are doing the {{hashCode()}}, {{equals()}} and {{comparesTo()}}, we are not synchronizing them as we like to avoid issues like MAPREDUCE-2954. But at the same, I did find that each of those IDs can have some fields set to zero when a thread calls {{getProto}} on them and the builder is still in progress. This seems to indicate that we will have very unreliable {{hashCode()}}, {{equals()}} etc., bq. This seems to indicate that we will have very unreliable hashCode(), equals() etc.
Thought more about this, and realized I am wrong about this. Because {{getProto()}} itself is synchronized, and we only use the getters which are also synchronized, we are good., Cancelling the patch to incorporate comments., Updated patch.

Re-using number format.
Updated allowed releaseaudit and findbugs warnings to 0

bq. Several needed null-checks are missing in toString() and comparesTo() methods in all the IDs.

Have hesitantly added some null checks to toString() (not compareTo). I don't think we should be adding these null checks for toString, hashCode and comapreTo. They'll just end up masking actual errors. Are there any cases for the ids to be used without all parameters set ?

bq. Thought more about this, and realized I am wrong about this. Because getProto() itself is synchronized, and we only use the getters which are also synchronized, we are good.
Yep, we should be fine - and without deadlocks like 2954., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., We need to agree upon what we wish to do with null checks. Cancelling patch while we do that., Spoke with Vinod about this. All fields in the Id classes are {{required}} fields and should not have explicit null checks - except for the standard ones in equals. An NPE in Ids does indicate a problem elsewhere in the code.
