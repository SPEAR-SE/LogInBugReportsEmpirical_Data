[The bug is raised from the direction of [~qwertymaniac] related to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-2081, Thanks shobin. I see trunk still has vaidya sources but perhaps not in active build (it doesn't appear to be mavenized). I am not sure if it is still maintained. However, any improvement patches are still welcome., [~qwertymaniac] I couldn't see the code in the svn trunk. Can you please let me know the url  of the trunk., I seem to have looked at a past Apache release's src/ directory when posting that, instead of the current trunk. You are correct that vaidya is no longer maintained/available on trunk and is probably shelved.

What version are you looking at a fix for? What version of Hadoop are you using Vaidya with?]
