This message was automatically generated., I've written a test for the case when type is null, based on the method TestBlocks.testHsTasksBlock. It basically sets the type as null and asserts that the data must not contain things that are only added when a type is available.  I had to move an amount of code to a new method (getAttempts) in order to avoid code duplication., \\
