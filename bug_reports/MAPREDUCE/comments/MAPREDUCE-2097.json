[Hello, 

I faced a similar error. Found out that it is causing for me because of '=' sign in my hostname.
As an example, please read the following snippet:

        URI u = URI.create("http://abcd--proto=dhcp:5006");
        String host = u.getHost();
        System.out.println("u.getHost = " + host);

It prints - 

u.getHost = null

From http://download.oracle.com/javase/1.4.2/docs/api/java/net/URI.html , I found out that '=' sign is a valid character.
Correct me if I am wrong. Is there a way out of this. I can't change my hostname. I hard-coded the address and built the jar for now. :)

Thanks,
Suraj
