[This changes MapReduce to only put the quotes in if the platform is not Windows., Thanks for reporting this Owen!

Did not know that the CLASSPATH cannot handle double quotes from your example. Interestingly, we settled on adding double quotes on Windows in {{TaskRunner#run()}} and trimming them away on the child side. However, with the CLASSPATH this does not really work. Please check out MAPREDUCE-4374, it contains the relevant discussion.]
