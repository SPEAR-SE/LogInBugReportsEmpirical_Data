[Going to add a RMAuditLogger class that has methods to log success/failure similar to jobtracker Auditlogger class.  

Certain of these don't make sense to log since the authentication will throw away unauthorized requests.

Right now I plan on logging the following things:

RM:
- all refresh commands - success and failure
- Application submissions
- Application kills
- AM registrations - failure and success
- illegal container allocations from AM - invalid container id or container not owned by App
- successful container allocations and deallocations from AM

NM:
- Container allocation successes, Example on how you would config for rm and nm audit logs:

rm.audit.logger=INFO,RMAUDIT
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.RMAuditLogger=${rm.audit.logger}
log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.RMAuditLogger=false
log4j.appender.RMAUDIT=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.RMAUDIT.File=${hadoop.log.dir}/rm-audit.log
log4j.appender.RMAUDIT.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.RMAUDIT.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %p %c{2}: %m%n
log4j.appender.RMAUDIT.DatePattern=.yyyy-MM-dd

nm.audit.logger=INFO,NMAUDIT
log4j.logger.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NMAuditLogger=${nm.audit.logger}
log4j.additivity.org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.nodemanager.NMAuditLogger=false
log4j.appender.NMAUDIT=org.apache.log4j.DailyRollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.NMAUDIT.File=${hadoop.log.dir}/nm-audit.log
log4j.appender.NMAUDIT.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.NMAUDIT.layout.ConversionPattern=%d{ISO8601} %p %c{2}: %m%n
log4j.appender.NMAUDIT.DatePattern=.yyyy-MM-dd, sample of what rm audit log would look like. This is running successful wordcount on small input file., sample nodemanager audit log.  Corresponds to attached rm audit log.  was from successful run of simple wordcount., I attached 2 samples file of what audit logs would look like from simple wordcount on small file. Note, I noticed cut and paste error in the rm-audit.log.  The APPID of a couple of those should be either CONTAINERID OR APPATTEMPTID., Thomas,
  Are the NM audit logs for container start  only?, yes currently that is all its doing.  my understand was that the authentication would block illegal allocations.  Is there others we want to log?, What abt done containers? killed containers? failed containers?, on the NM side I added logging the following:

   * Container allocation successes and failure
   * successful container completes (ie done)
   * failed containers
   * killed containers
