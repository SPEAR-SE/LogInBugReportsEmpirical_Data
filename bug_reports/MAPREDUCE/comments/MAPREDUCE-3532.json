[When we set 0 as port for *NM_WEBAPP_ADDRESS*,  *this.httpPort* will be assigned the same value. While sending registeration requestion to the RM, NM sends the same http port as part of its request. In this case http port happens 0.

{code:title=NodeStatusUpdaterImpl.java|borderStyle=solid}
    InetSocketAddress httpBindAddress =
      NetUtils.createSocketAddr(httpBindAddressStr,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_WEBAPP_PORT,
        YarnConfiguration.NM_WEBAPP_ADDRESS);
    try {
      //      this.hostName = InetAddress.getLocalHost().getCanonicalHostName();
      this.httpPort = httpBindAddress.getPort();
{code}, Updating the *NM_WEBAPP_ADDRESS* with NM's webserver http port. Attached the patch for the same. Please review., Attaching patch with Testcases. Pls review, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
