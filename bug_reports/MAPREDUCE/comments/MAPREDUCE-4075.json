[I think, we should update the *localhost* with the actual NM *hostname*. Also we need to update the 
	* port 1234 with NM_LOCALIZER_PORT
        * port 8042 with NM_WEBAPP_PORT., Is this a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-3682?, Thanks Jason, [MAPREDUCE-3682|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3682] also addressing the same issue. So resolving this one as duplicate.]
