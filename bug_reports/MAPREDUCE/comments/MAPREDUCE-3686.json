[While incrementing the counters, existence of counters group has been checked in *groups* map. If not found in *groups* map, created a new group and stored the same group back in the *groups* map.

{code:title=AbstractCounters.java|borderStyle=solid}
   G left = groups.get(right.getName());
      if (left == null) {
        limits.checkGroups(groups.size() + 1);
        left = groupFactory.newGroup(right.getName(), right.getDisplayName(),
                                     limits);
        groups.put(right.getName(), left);
      }
}
{code} 

However while getting CounterGroup, if it is a framework related, getting from *fgroups* map, otherwise, from *groups* map.

{code:title=CountersBlock.java|borderStyle=solid}
boolean isFGroup = isFrameworkGroup(newGroupName);
G group = isFGroup ? fgroups.get(newGroupName) : groups.get(newGroupName);
}
{code}

I think, this is causing issue and we need to update same in AbstractCounters#incrAllCounters method as well.
