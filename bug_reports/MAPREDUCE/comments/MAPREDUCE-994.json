[I agree, though currently the usage output is simply:
$ hadoop job -counter
Usage: JobClient [-counter <job-id> <group-name> <counter-name>]

I couldn't the example of
hadoop job -counter org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.TaskCounter REDUCE_INPUT_RECORDS
to work. Is it working for others? Access to the various MapReduce counters would be highly desirable.
, I'm going to close this as stale.]
