[bq. test-patch did not complain for the patch build which introduced the warning.
Warning was introduced in MAPREDUCE-1762, Attaching Scott Chen's patch from MAPREDUCE-1762, *sigh* Sorry, nevermind. I'll just commit the fix to the warning as part of the issue that introduced it. I don't think it's related to this bug., Chris, this jira is to fix hudson's test-patch target for javadoc. Currently it is not running javadoc target at all.
The console output of one of the patch builds shows:
{noformat}
     [exec] 
     [exec] javadoc:
     [exec]     [mkdir] Created dir: /grid/0/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Mapreduce-Patch-h4.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/trunk/build/docs/api

{noformat}, Sorry for the trouble, guys. I will definitely be more careful next time., Closing as stale.]
