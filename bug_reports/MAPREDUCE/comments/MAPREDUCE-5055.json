[Attaching the modified code to reproduce., @Deepesh, would you please make sure hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.x.jar is not in the mapreduce lib directory? If it is, "hadoop jar build/hadoop-examples-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar" will not run RandomWriter in hadoop-examples-1.2.0-SNAPSHOT.jar, but run RandomWriter in hadoop-mapreduce-examples-2.x.jar. I guess this might be reason why you didn't see the expected exception when running the hadoop-1 example on hadoop-2., Thanks Zhijie. It turns out that examples jar is included in the classpath when hadoop jar command is run. I renamed my Class to something else and then I got the expected result i.e. the job failed with Counter limit exceeded error.]
