[can you provide more details?
say for example 
your key fields have a " " at the end?

like

"map.output.key.value.fields.spec", "6     ,5,1-3:0-"
instead of 
"map.output.key.value.fields.spec", "6,5,1-3:0-"
, Hi,
Can you provide more details on it? I tried to run TestFieldSelection test case and can see that it is explicitly done by TestMRFieldSelection but not able to find any such instance with FieldSelectionMapReduce.
