[This patch pre-empts MAPREDUCE-1378. It should apply cleanly to branch-20 as the patch for 1378 has not been applied. A slightly different patch would have to be ported to 0.21. However, the jobhistory.jsp code has been completely overhauled as of trunk.


, You say it "sometimes results in doubly-URL-encoded logFile paths" - which cases are a problem? Can you describe how to reproduce this please?
, It always double encodes, it's just that the problem only shows up when there are URL encodable characters in the path. I'll see if I can reproduce and post a screenshot.

, I think the problem (on 0.20.0) is that characters in the file path before the final name are not URL encoded. See JobHistory.JobInfo.encodeJobHistoryFilePath().

The fix in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1378 for 0.21.0 onwards (where the code is radically different due to MAPREDUCE-157) is not comprehensive, as noted there. Also, as [noted|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-1378?focusedCommentId=12800619&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12800619] by Amar there, the fix is to introduce a helper function like JobHistory.JobInfo.encodeJobHistoryFilePath()  that encodes the whole path, not just the file name.]
