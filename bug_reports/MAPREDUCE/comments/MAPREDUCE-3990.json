This message is automatically generated., Any comments on the patch? It is a trivial parsing bug-fix, but I'd like to wait for a +1 in any case., Given this patch's trivialness and that it merely enhances the tool rather than do anything negative, and that it has passed the QA run just fine, I'll commit it in by monday EOD unless anyone has any objections.
