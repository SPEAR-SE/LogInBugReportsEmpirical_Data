This message is automatically generated., This looks good; shall we also mark TaggedInputSplit public for those who wish to determine logic based on Context.getInputSplit()?, Almost all other input splits are public I think, including FileSplit., That makes sense to me.  Should it have InterfaceAudience.Stable?, Yes I suppose we could throw that in; there has not been drastic changes to it over the years. Besides, it implements the public interface of InputSplit anyway.

A test case, specifically for the use of a TIS#getFile method, would be good to catch any future i/face stability regressions., TaggedInputSplit has no getFile method as far as I can tell?, +1. Please open another jira for the annotation changes, thx, Thanks Sandy.
