I agree that it is ugly to see the exception come out, but I am not really sure that your fix is the right one for 1.0.  Making the memory manager blocking means that the jetty thread on the task tracker will not be able to serve up results to others.  This could potentially slow down processing for very large jobs.  I think it would be a lot better to do something like that on trunk, where the problem also exists, but the node manager uses netty instead of jetty so it is not a full thread that is blocked but just some memory and a file descriptor.  Assuming that we have a timeout on how long the thread waits for memory to become available., \\
