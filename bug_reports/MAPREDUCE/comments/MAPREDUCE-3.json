[A caution here is that {{mapred.child.ulimit}} needs to account for the memory overhead of the JVM itself. Merely setting {{mapred.child.ulimit}} to the same value as the {{-Xmx}}_hhhh_{{m}} in {{mapred.child.java.opts}} will fail to launch child tasks. You'll need some overhead room; I don't know exactly how much.

, Who sets ulimit anymore? No one. Why? cgroups and /proc-based memory limits. Closing as stale.]
