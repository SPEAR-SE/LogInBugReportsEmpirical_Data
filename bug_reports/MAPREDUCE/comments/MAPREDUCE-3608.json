[Trivial patch for fix the compilation issue., My bad, I relied on the hudson +1 for MAPREDUCE-3522 which had a timing issue with the MAPREDUCE-3547 commit.

I just committed this. Thanks Mahadev!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1482 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1482/])
