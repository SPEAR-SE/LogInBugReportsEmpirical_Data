[Also related is MAPREDUCE-2384 (test at least can be reused), and perhaps MAPREDUCE-1588 if it still applies to limits available in Yarn's mrapp.

The splits are currently computed and written in one call, and hence they are to be done after a staging directory is available (with a job ID on its path). I've not seen too many failures in practice at the input split computation level, but the idea of separating these two calls seems alright to me.
