[A trival patch, changed the log statement to debug level, It would be better we add log entries every time a node changes its health status (healthy -> not healthy and vice versa)., We log everytime when node changes it health status. But currently when a node becomes unhealthy, every subsequent heart beat we log "Adding blacklisted reason for tracker :". This has to be changed as we might end up logging a line per blacklisted tracker every heartbeat, filling up the log files.

The logging of the change in health status is done in line number 648 and 623 of {{JobTracker}}, Got it. Minor improvement: if the reason-for-blacklisting is changed, we probably want to log it as INFO., Attaching patch incorporating Hong's comment:

* Whenever a new blacklisting reason is added we log the addition of reason., The attached patch file did not apply to trunk. I created a new one with the same fix., Since this is a trivial fix and a change only to LOG messages, I am going to commit this. I ran TestTaskTrackerBlacklisting just to be sure., I just committed this. Thanks, Sreekanth !, Yahoo distribution patch for the issue., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #20 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/20/])
