[Looking at the constructor of JobTracker, it looks like JobTracker advertises itself before it has completed initialization.  Given that the constructor is not synchronized, my guess is that JobTracker.submitJob is getting called before initialization completes, thus myMetrics is null causing the NPE., I still see this occasionally with Hadoop 0.14.3.

myMetrics.submitJob();
throws NPE on line 1491., Gone stale, and test failure does not occur now. Closing out.]
