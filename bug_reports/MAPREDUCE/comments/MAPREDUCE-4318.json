[Fixed the hardcoded keys.
Still need to use deprecated config key for mapred.queue.names, The other option will be to define the new way fo defining the queue configuration. This is followed in some other tests. I'll try that and attach a new patch, Th other option was to use the new scheme of specifying mapred-queues.xml containing he queue configuration. I used QueueManagerTestUtils class to achieve this. But there are other mapred-queues.xml in the classpath which gets picked up before test's mapred-queues.xml with different configuration.

These files seem to be created when I build using eclipse and if I remove those mapred-queues.xml, then test passes. So this may be an eclipse created problem. 

The old scheme of defining queues does not use mapred-queues.xml and hence will work regardless multiple mapred-queues.xml issues.

Since we are not testing Queue management here, I believe, keeping the following line makes the test more reliable.

mr.getJobTrackerConf().set(DeprecatedQueueConfigurationParser.MAPRED_QUEUE_NAMES_KEY,
        "default");


So I recommend to go with the attached patch. Please let me know if there are some other ideas.
