[This is fixed in hadoop 0.21 as part of MAPREDUCE-364, Ported part of MAPREDUCE-364 to Hadoop 0.20., Removed unnecessary changes to examples.
, MAPREDUCE-1112.1.patch changed the CombineFileInputFormat to implement InputFormat instead of FileInputFormat.
It is not backward compatible.

I will make CombineFileInputFormat inherits from FileInputFormat as before but just fix the bug of host name/rack name.
, MAPREDUCE-1112.2.patch: This patch only contains what is needed for CombineFileInputFormat to work with hadoop 0.20.

This message is automatically generated., Hadoop QA is trying to apply it to trunk... But this is for branch 0.20., BTW, just to speed up the review, this patch is a subset of changes in MAPREDUCE-364, which is already committed to trunk.
, Hi Zheng. This looks like the same patch as in HADOOP-5759 (not sure how MAPREDUCE-364 plays in here). So is this JIRA really just that we should apply the HADOOP-5759 patch to branch-20?

Is there a unit test which can verify this by actually running a job using CombineFileInputFormat?, My bad. Yes it's the same as HADOOP-5759, except a file name change.

I will commit HADOOP-5759 to branch-0.20, and mark this one as duplicate.

, Duplicate of HADOOP-5759.]
