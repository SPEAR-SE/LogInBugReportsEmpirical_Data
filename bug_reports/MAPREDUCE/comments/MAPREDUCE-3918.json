[Two things.  mapred in the past did not echo its command before running, neither does hdfs, only yarn seems to.  I would prefer to see this removed.

Also I see that we tag all other commands with this -Dproc_ also.  But I could not find any documentation on why, and no use of these values in the code.  Is this for monitoring or something?, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

In the past, the -Dproc_historyserver was the first argument on the
command line for monitoring purposes. This allows quick and easy determination of what processes are running using ps on the command line., Uploading patch reflecting the intent of MAPREDUCE-3866, Patch also addresses Bobby's comment, +1 I just commited this to trunk and branch-0.23, Thanks bobby., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit #590 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit/590/])
