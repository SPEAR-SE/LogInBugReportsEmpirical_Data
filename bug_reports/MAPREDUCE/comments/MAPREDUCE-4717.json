[Hi Sagar, this looks to me to be most likely a configuration error, in which case you should try emailing a user mailing list. I'm guessing from the facts that you say you configured federation and you're using MR1 that you're using CDH, in which case you should email cdh-user@cloudera.org. If I'm wrong about that and you're somehow using a straight Apache release, then you should email user@hadoop.apache.org., Thanks Aaron.

I am using CDH and will email to cdh-user@cloudera.org.

Thanks for the info.]
