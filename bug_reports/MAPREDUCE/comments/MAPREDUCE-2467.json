[This patch fixes the build issues. I also cleaned up imports and dead code warnings., Please hold off on the review, I still need some more changes., Changes:
# Made changes corresponding to federation changes.
# Cleaned up many warnings related to unused imports, dead code, unused methods.
# Added maxmemory parameter to junit test. Without this, tests launched under contrib directory fail with OutOfMemoryError.
# With federation, MiniDFSCluster to corrupt files and getting at a block file for a block is much cleaner. Changed the raid contrib to adapt this cleaner code., Can Dhruba or Todd, can you please review this patch., +1   lgtm, +1 looks good, Thanks for making the changes!, Updated patch with change from MAPREDUCE-2465 reverted., -1 overall.

Ramkumar, can you please help with addressing this. I can work with you on this, if you need information about federation changes., Hi Suresh

Sorry for the delay in responding. I think the test failures are unrelated
 1. testConcurrentJobs is failing because one file is not detected as corrupt and so block fixer does not fix it. This seems to be intermittent, since I tried running the test and it succeeded twice. I dont think this is related to federation. Perhaps we can track it separately?
 2. testFileBlockAndParityBlockMissingHar2 failed because of insufficient heap space when running a HAR job through LocalJobRunner. Again, unrelated to federation
 3. testJobQueues - Failed because of a timeout. Also, RAID changes cannot affect core mapred tests, so this must be unrelated., Thanks Ramkumar for the feedback. Then I will go ahead and commit this patch. Separate issues can be filed to track the test failures., I just committed this to trunk. thanks suresh., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #663 (See [https://builds.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/663/])
