, The license shouldn't be a problem from [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-862?focusedCommentId=12750902&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12750902].

Also the same comment mentions that if the scripts cannot be downloadable, the failure should be graceful. Priyou, are you finding it otherwise?, Though I agree that references to yui.yahooapis.com should be removed but looks like that wasn't the main issue causing the problem.

We have queue names in production which have dash/hyphen in them.  The generated code is converting them to javascript variables and dashes/hyphen in javascript variable is not allowed and hence nothing shows up.  The code generation should be fixed so that it converts the dashes in queue names to underscores when it creates javascript variables.


This works
==========
var hdmi_hadoopengTreeNode = new YAHOO.widget.MenuNode("hdmi-hadoopeng", tree.getRoot(), false);
hdmi_hadoopengTreeNode.data="Queue configuration<br/>Capacity Percentage: 5.0%<br/>User Limit: 30%<br/>Priority Supported: YES<br/>-------------<br/>Map tasks<br/>Capacity: 5 slots<br/>Maximum capacity: 33 slots<br/>Used capacity: 0 (0.0% of Capacity)<br/>Running tasks: 0<br/>-------------<br/>Reduce tasks<br/>Capacity: 4 slots<br/>Maximum capacity: 24 slots<br/>Used capacity: 0 (0.0% of Capacity)<br/>Running tasks: 0<br/>-------------<br/>Job info<br/>Number of Waiting Jobs: 0<br/>Number of users who have submitted jobs: 0<br/>";
hdmi_hadoopengTreeNode.name="hdmi-hadoopeng";


This doesn't work because of the dash/hiphen in the variable names
==================================================================
var hdmi-hadoopengTreeNode = new YAHOO.widget.MenuNode("hdmi-hadoopeng", tree.getRoot(), false);
hdmi-hadoopengTreeNode.data="Queue configuration<br/>Capacity Percentage: 5.0%<br/>User Limit: 30%<br/>Priority Supported: YES<br/>-------------<br/>Map tasks<br/>Capacity: 5 slots<br/>Maximum capacity: 33 slots<br/>Used capacity: 0 (0.0% of Capacity)<br/>Running tasks: 0<br/>-------------<br/>Reduce tasks<br/>Capacity: 4 slots<br/>Maximum capacity: 24 slots<br/>Used capacity: 0 (0.0% of Capacity)<br/>Running tasks: 0<br/>-------------<br/>Job info<br/>Number of Waiting Jobs: 0<br/>Number of users who have submitted jobs: 0<br/>";
