This message was automatically generated., Hi [~aw] Only update of XML is done. So testcases are not added, We also need some additions for mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data.buffer.kb and mapreduce.job.encrypted-intermediate-data-key-size-bits in the encrypted shuffle markdown document., Hi [~aw] have updated the patch again , \\
