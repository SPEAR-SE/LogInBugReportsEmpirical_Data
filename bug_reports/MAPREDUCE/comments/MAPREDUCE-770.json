Yes, this is a good improvement over the tests.

Change the priority to minor since this helps when the unit test fails with an AssertionFailedError but the unit test is not supposed to fail.  In the case that the unit test fails, we could do "ant clean"., ant clean does not solve the problem.  Some of the junk files are left on HDFS ., > ... Some of the junk files are left on HDFS . 

I may be wrong.  I think the junk files are left in MiniDFSCluster.  In such case, ant clean should remove everything., https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-770?focusedCommentId=12732768&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_12732768 could well be correct.  

I don't claim to have enough knowledge to refute that claim, and it's plausible.
