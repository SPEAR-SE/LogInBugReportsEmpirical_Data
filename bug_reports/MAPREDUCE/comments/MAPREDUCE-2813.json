[I think the root cause of this was me using values that were too small for dfs.namenode.handler.count, dfs.datanode.max.xcievers and ipc.client.connection.maxidletime. After tweaking those I was able to prevent the error from happening. However, I still think the way this was handled is wrong.. you should be allowed to speculate tasks that fail to load up for this reason, rather than having them hang for 8 minutes., Updated description to remove an insanely long line.]
