[Hi,
in JobHistoryEverntHandler and HistoryFileManager, the FileAlreadyExistsException was only tracked for Logging purpose.

YarnChild.java::configureLocalDirs() tracked the FileAlreadyExistsException to determine which task should open the directory for write and which one for read.

<code>
      workDir = lDirAlloc.getLocalPathForWrite("work", job);
      FileSystem lfs = FileSystem.getLocal(job).getRaw();
      boolean madeDir = false;
      try {
        madeDir = lfs.mkdirs(workDir);
      } catch (FileAlreadyExistsException e) {
        madeDir = true;
        workDir = lDirAlloc.getLocalPathToRead("work", job);
}
<code>

However the method's goal according to its documentation is to create the mapred-local output directory. Shouldn't it be writable anyway?
I have removed the try catch and the read only open in the patch.
