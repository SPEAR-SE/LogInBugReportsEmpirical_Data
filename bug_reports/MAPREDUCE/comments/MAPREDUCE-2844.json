[Earlier, before the major refactoring, the nodeID was provided by the resourcetracker  at ResourceManager by a nodecounter,which was 0,1 and incremented so on as nodes got added. Presently, it is replaced by host:port pair. I think its fine displaying the host:pair as nodeID., Yes, NodeIDs weren't useful, we couldn't point to the corresponding NM easily.

We should just rename the header to be NMAddress or some such., Ya Vinod , That's fair enough. May be we can rename it to Node Address, as terminology in that page refers to a Node rather than NM., Attached the trivial patch which renames the NodeID as Node Address and Host as Node HTTP address., -1 overall.
