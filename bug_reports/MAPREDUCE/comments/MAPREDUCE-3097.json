[archive command was issued as such

bin/hadoop  archive -archiveName archive.har -p /archive_tests/src archive_14/file* archive_tests/dst

The archive job ran successfully but when looking at the content of the archive it had no content., The contents is actually archived. What goes wrong here is that listStatus() in HarFileSystem does not list the archive's top level content unless the index contains a root directory (i.e., "/").

There are two possibilities to fix this unwanted behaviour:
1) make sure the hadoop archive tool always creates a root directory entry in the index.
2) make listStatus() work even when there is no root directory entry in the index.

There is something to be said in favor of both options. Maybe the HAR file and index format is formally specified somewhere (if so, can someone point me to this?). Does the specification imply either of these two options? Does anyone have an opinion on either? , Patched against trunk., This patch makes listStatus() return the HAR's content if there is no root dir present. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
