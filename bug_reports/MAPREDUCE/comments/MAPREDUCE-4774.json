[Thanks for the analysis, Ivan!  JobImpl's state machine is missing a number of events in the FAILED state.  Due to the asynchronous nature of the job, task, and task attempt state machines, it is possible for tasks and task attempts to complete even though the job overall has decided to fail for other reasons.  Therefore we need to ignore these additional events in the FAILED state to avoid their asynchronous arrival from knocking us out of the FAILED state and into the ERROR state.

JOB_TASK_COMPLETED
JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED
JOB_MAP_TASK_RESCHEDULED
, This test failure is pretty pervasive and annoying, so taking this to get it fixed quickly.  Patch ignores some asynchronous task events in the FAILED state much like we do in the ERROR state, along with corresponding unit tests to verify we're handling them properly., Editing headline to more accurately reflect the root cause., The change looks simple enough and does fix the failing test.  I am +1 p[ending Jenkins approval., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I ran TestRecovery Manually and it looks like it is a spurious failure.  We should file a JIRA to fix it.  Checking in the patch now., Thanks Jason,
