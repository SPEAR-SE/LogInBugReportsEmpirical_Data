[Here is a patch that ignores FileNotFoundExceptions, and just creates empty boxes for portions of the output log that are not present.

I marked this issue fix for 0.16.0 -- I'm not sure if I missed the cutoff, but this is a low-impact issue (only affects the TaskLogServlet), and it makes it less convenient for me to debug failed map tasks, so it is important for me., This should be re-written to test if the file exists rather than catching the exception. Exceptions should be saved for unexpected problems., > This should be re-written to test if the file exists rather than catching the exception. Exceptions should be saved for unexpected problems.

This would make the patch much more complicated, because the code that synthesizes the filename is buried in the TaskLog.Reader constructor.
, I'm going to close this out as stale.]
