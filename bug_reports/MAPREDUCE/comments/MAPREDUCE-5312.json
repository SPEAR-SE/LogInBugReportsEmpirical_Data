, The test failure is due the flattening of nodereport right which is basically a refactoring? However, the patch seems to remove the offending lines from the test that check that the node is healthy. Shouldnt new code have been added that verify the same condition holds via other attributes of the node report?, The reasoning behind YARN-686 was that having Healthy=true/false as well as a NodeState which reports the same in RUNNING/UNHEALTHY was redundant.  So we are verifying the same condition by asserting that the node state is RUNNING.]
