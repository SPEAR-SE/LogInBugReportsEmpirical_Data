[The 3.0.0-SNAPSHOT package -Pdist successfully builds on PPC (see above mentioned environment). Patch(HADOOP-10846) meant an improvement for native support, though it didn't solve the above problem.   , This patch makes Checksum.cc more compatible for compiling, just like code in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/util/bulk_crc32.c

"#if defined(USE_HARDWARE_CRC32C) && defined(__GNUC__) && (defined(__amd64__) || defined(__i386))"
(repeating the conditional from the top) compilation phase passes successfully.
SUCCESS: Hadoop distro was built ( package  -Pdist,native) for ppc64 as (32-bit version) completely.
Next, I will continue with testing. 
This bug was issued concerning a compilation problem. Hence, I will change the state to resolved.    
  , Build fails after applying the patch in ppc64le RHEL7.1 Machine.

This message was automatically generated., Any update here ?. This issue is lingering around for a long time. , Why is the patch checking for __GNUC__?, The code is basically copied from https://github.com/apache/hadoop-common/blob/trunk/hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/src/main/native/src/org/apache/hadoop/util/bulk_crc32.c  which checks for __GNUC__ 
, We should understand why the code is there even if it copied from somewhere else (actually, especially if it was copied).

In general, the organization of bulk_crc32.c could be improved.  Having so many ifdefs makes it difficult to figure out what code is actually being called and do reviews.  I would like to see the hardware-specific parts into separate files rather than having so many ifdefs in the code., Move it out of 2.8 given this issue is pending for more than 1 year., | (x) *{color:red}-1 overall{color}* |
