[The JobConf, JobClient and a whole bunch of classes moved to the hadoop-mr-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core maven module. Locally we install these modules and then go ahead with compilation via ant.

We can take one of the two steps: (1) Follow the same steps in Jenkins scripts to first install the maven modules locally and then run ant (2) Publish all the new mapreduce maven modules to apache maven repositories.

Giri, comment on which one's the easier path? (2) definitely is the correct path, I think, but I am not sure who/what publishes the modules (for e.g. common) to maven repos. , For now approach (1) should be fine; as we need to aggregate the number of jar files that yarn has to publish to maven repo before publishing the jar files.

, This patch fixes the eclipse plugin compilation issue., +1

Thanks for taking care of this Giri!, I just committed this , Thanks Arun, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #774 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/774/])
