[This is something that I have wanted to do for a while, and now that DEBUG_MODE has been removed it makes a lot of since to do it.  +1 for the idea.  It would be good to make sure that we delete the yyyy/mm/dd directories as well, because currently we leak them., I just looked at the code again, and I think I misunderstood the first time, so I wanted to make sure we're on the same page.  Currently, all the yyyy/mm/dd directories are gathered, then sorted in ascending order by time.  Then we go through and delete files until we reach a young enough directory, then halt.  I had thought that job history files inside dd/ directories that were too young were being examined, but they are not.

The load on HDFS could be decreased further by, say, if the max age is 2 years, and it's 2012, not looking at anything deeper in the 2011 dir (and same for months).  But would this be worthwhile?  It would make a difference only if the max history age were greater than a month (default is a week), in which case it could save a listStatus for each month of age.

If not, I could still make it delete the old folders., The patch makes it now only gather the directories that could possibly be old enough., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The new patch uses a simpler/clearer way of comparing dates., Thanks Robert.  The code looks good.  Just a couple more things:
* Can you add javadoc to the top of the method explaining what it's doing
* Can you add short comments above the if statements like "(year < cYear || month <= cMonth)" explaining why they work.
* Can you put the "catch"s on the same lines as the try block close braces
* Can you make it clear that we're ignoring exceptions because they mean we found something in the directory that doesn't fit our format? , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
