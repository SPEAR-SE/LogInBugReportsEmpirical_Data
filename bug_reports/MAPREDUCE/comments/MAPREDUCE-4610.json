[Here's a patch that fixes this. I tested it manually by starting a cluster and running a job that creates more than the default number of counters (120). When I increased mapreduce.job.counters.limit beyond that number I didn't see any counter limit exception. 

Writing a unit test is actually difficult since the limits are loaded statically. I'd like to fix that as a part of fixing the client-side limit enforcement problem in MAPREDUCE-3936. But I think this is useful to go in as a compatibility fix first., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
