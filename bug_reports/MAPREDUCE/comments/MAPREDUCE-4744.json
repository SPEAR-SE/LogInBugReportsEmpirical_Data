[Hi Devaraj, this seems to be the same as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/YARN-167. Do you think so?
, I don't think it is same as YARN-167. It is specifically coming at TaskAttempt state is SUCCESS_CONTAINER_CLEANUP., I am fixing all the issues related to TA_KILL at MAPREDUCE-4751. Closing this as duplicate.

Appreciate help validating the fix though.]
