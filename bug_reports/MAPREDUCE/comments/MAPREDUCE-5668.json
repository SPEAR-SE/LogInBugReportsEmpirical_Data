[This is something more appropriately asked on the [user@ mailing list|http://hadoop.apache.org/mailing_lists.html#User].  JIRAs are for reporting bugs against Hadoop, and this does not appear to be a bug.  It looks like the code has been compiled against a 2.x release but then run against a 1.x release, as org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobContext changed from a class to an interface between the 1.x and 2.x releases.

The org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.* API is only guaranteed to be source, not binary, compatible between the 1.x and 2.x releases.   See the [binary compatibility document|http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/r2.2.0/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/MapReduce_Compatibility_Hadoop1_Hadoop2.html] for more details.  Also we cannot generally support compiling against a later release and then running on an earlier release, because new APIs could have been added and would not appear in the older release., Closing this as invalid based on the evidence from MAPREDUCE-5667.  The code is being compiled against a later release but then run on an earlier release.  The code should be compiled against the Hadoop release being used or an earlier release, keeping in mind the binary compatibility document guidelines., See also: http://wiki.apache.org/hadoop/InvalidJiraIssues

We aren't going to fix these problems as they aren't bugs in Hadoop, they are because you are running an out of date version and everytime something doesn't work coming to JIRA and asking for help. That help is not going to happen, all that will is that your issues will get ignored in future, which is dangerous if you ever come across a real bug *in an up to date version of Hadoop*

# upgrade to Hadoop 1.2 or 2.2
# ask the user group if you encounter problems on these versions
# if that isn't enough, look at who offers support for Hadoop and consider whether it is something you are prepared to pay for. If not, the source code is there for you to debug your problems]
