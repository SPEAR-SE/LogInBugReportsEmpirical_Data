[The property 'mapred.submit.replication' is configurable for that reason; or is this a request to lower that value?

Indeed, this would also hamper decommissioning efforts when an admin doesn't know about it.

I think making it dynamic makes sense, but adds RPC overheads possibly, per submission., My original intent was to have the system automatically do something like mapred.submit.replication = min(10, number_of_nodes), so that job submission would not require setting mapred.submit.replication manually to avoid the under-replication warnings (on small clusters).

I see your point, though, that that would cause depencencies between HDFS and Map/Reduce.]
