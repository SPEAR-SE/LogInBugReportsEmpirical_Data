[Patch that improves TaskRunner's error-checking.  This makes the failure mechanism more obvious but does not address the nondeterministic behavior of TestTrackerBlacklistAcrossJobs.  (A minor tweak - removing the "throw ie;" line - _does_ fix the test.  However, I'm assuming we don't want to ignore the failure to create job-acl.xml in the general case.), Just FYI, I ran TestTrackerBlacklistAcrossJobs 16 times without any failures on a local (ext3 on md) filesystem on the same node as above.  The nondeterminism definitely seems to be associated either with non-guaranteed filesystem semantics (i.e., bad assumptions in the test and/or MR code) or with network timing and asynchronous function calls (which I guess also devolves to bad assumptions in the test and/or MR code).  Given that NFS is normally relevant only for development and personal runs of "ant test" (and frequently not even there), this doesn't seem like critical problem.

If anyone ever wants to track down other NFS-related failures, however, this might be a useful test case to get started.]
