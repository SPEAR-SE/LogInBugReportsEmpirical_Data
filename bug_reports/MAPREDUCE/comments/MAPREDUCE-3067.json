, Second aspect to this is the exit status is checked on completion of map or reduce tasks., Good catch, Hitesh!

bq. Second aspect to this is the exit status is checked on completion of map or reduce tasks.
This isn't clear to me, more details please?, Ate a couple of words in that statement. The code in RMContainerAllocator currently keeps a count of completed maps and reduces but does not seem to check the exit status. For the sake of documentation, it would be good if you could clarify as to why the exit status does not need to be checked for map/reduce task containers., bq. [..] why the exit status does not need to be checked for map/reduce task containers.
In MRV2 framework, successful maps and reduces directly talk to the AM via {{TaskUmbilicalProtocol.done()}}. If the task JVM happens to crash after the done() call, it doesn't really affect the real outcome of the task - so no point in checking the exit code to be zero. For failed and crashed tasks, we can just use the exit-code to let the user know via web-UI/command-line.

Other frameworks, like the DistributedShell you are writing, may not have this direct communication between container and AM and so can leverage the exit-code for figuring out the outcome of the containers., Trivial fix with modified unit tests. , Minor copy-paste fix pending, +1 overall.
