[Jason,
 Is there a bug for OOM? What was the reason for that?, No bug for the OOM yet, unfortunately cluster was re-deployed before grabbing a full heap dump.  I do have the jmap -hist:live output from one of the nodemanagers but haven't had a chance to go through it yet to see if it helps pinpoint where the leak would be., Originally when I wrote this, I had the same suspicion about the join. But later, I made sure all exceptions were caught and that the boolean gets set in all possible cases. OOM/errors are one thing that didn't occur to me.

Can you debug as to why you ran into OOM ? We need to fix that definitely, irrespective of how we want to handle other errors., Comment race;) Even the stack trace during OOM will help., Attaching hist:live dump from one of the nodemanagers that had hit the OOM error multiple times in the log aggregation threads before eventually trying to shut down.  Unfortunately I don't have a full map dump or stack dump from that process., Patch to ensure we always set the finished boolean in the log aggregation thread.

On a side note we haven't seen a reoccurrence of the OOM condition on the nodemanager, so we haven't been able to track down what caused it., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
