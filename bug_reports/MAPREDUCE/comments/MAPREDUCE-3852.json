[I think this was introduced by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-8035 when it removed the hadoop-project/pom.xml plugin to create-testdirs., here is patch that reverts the change and fixes the tests. it doesn't seem to affect build times much. I didn't look into other ways to solve but if someone wants to take a look, go for it.

build command:  mvn clean install site package -Pdist -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true

ran multiple times, with this change it seems to take 4 to 10 seconds longer then without it.  That is out of about 7 minutes build time., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The jenkins build patched the wrong file. This patch is for the top level hadoop-project/pom.xml. The build does a patch -p1 which patched hadoop-mapreduce-project/pom.xml, Thanks Thomas. Committing now!, I just committed this. Thanks Thomas. Am kicking off the trunk and 0.23 builds. Hopefully they are back to normal., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1719 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1719/])
