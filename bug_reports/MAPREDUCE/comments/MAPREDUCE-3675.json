[No maps jobs are valid use-cases. For jobs with no maps, and sometimes even no reducers, I know of customers who depend on the side-effects caused by setup/cleanup tasks and/or job-success state. This is generally useful in workflow scenarios which run periodically and when they run into cases where some job in the workflow doesn't have input data, but has to cause either some side-effect or just finish successfully so that downstream jobs can proceed without breakage.

Given that, I think this should be closed as invalid.

Because of the same, we are supporting 0maps/0reduces cases in mrv2 also., Agree with Vinod.

Oozie workflows with such jobs is a particularly important use-case for this 'feature'., Resolution is cool by me. I'll refer this ticket to folks requesting explanations henceforth - thanks for your specific comments Vinod and Arun! :), Just for the record, oozie launcher jobs are always 1M/0R with an input of 1 record, thus the map() method is called exactly once. Oozie explicitly sets 1map/0reduce/no-speculative-exec., Thanks Alejandro, for clarifying on Oozie.

Vinod's use cases, however unorthodox-looking, would be reason enough we shouldn't break this.

Not that it causes any major issues (apart from temporary slot soakups, maybe).]
