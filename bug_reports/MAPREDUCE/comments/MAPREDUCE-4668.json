[Hey Thomas. This bug is due to JETTY-1316. We have a patched build of Jetty on our github: https://github.com/cloudera/jetty-hadoop-fix/commits/6.1.26.cloudera and also in our maven repository (version 6.1.26.cloudera.2), if you want to try it out.

Fixing the bug monitor to abort would also work, but we should be careful that there isn't a race at startup time, where the selector is in the process of starting but hasn't yet done so., thanks Todd, yeah we still haven't had a chance to try your patched jetty version. 

I agree with you about being careful for the race at startup.  I haven't checked our clusters to see if we see the warning message but the jetty thread is actually there., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2.]
