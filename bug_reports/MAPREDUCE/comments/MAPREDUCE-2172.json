[@Nigel, both Patrick and I see ant test-patch fail on a clean checkout. We think this is related to HADOOP-7008. Is there some configuration we should change before running ant test-patch?, Giri and I worked on getting Common pre-commit testing back in shape and that is now working (as of last night).  I suspect MR trunk has drifted from clean javadoc, findbugs, and release audit warnings since it's MR pre-commit testing was working.  We'll move on to cleaning this and HDFS up soon., The same issue exists in hadoop-common, where test-patch on a clean checkout yields 2 new findbugs warnings., I think part of the problem is that the exact number of warnings depends on the version of findbugs used. Is there a specific version that every developer should be using?, Same is true on HDFS - empty patches still claim lots of "new" release audit warnings.

it looks like the test-patch script and the properties file are both 'externaled' in via SVN. but the properties file is obviously project-specific information. Can we just use externals for the script itself and check the properties file into each project separately?, This adds the necessary base levels of release audit and findbug warnings.  With an empty patch on trunk, I'm currentlyl seeing 13 findbugs warnings (I'll file an issue to fix these) and 2 release audit warnings that are ok., I just committed this.  If you continue to experience problems with test-patch target, please open a new Jira and assign to me., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #554 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/554/])
