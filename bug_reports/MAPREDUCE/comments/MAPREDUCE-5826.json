This message is automatically generated., Root cause is the permissions we set for token files. In Windows, 400 does not allow applications to write to the token file which we need to be able to do for updating tokens. The patch changes the permissions to 700 for Windows., The patch and the rationale look good to me. It's passing now for me too.

Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Varun!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5498 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5498/])
