{code}, Debug logs seem to be point to a container being allocated for the AM in RMAppAttemptImpl#ScheduleTransition itself  ( when transitioning from SUBMITTED -> SCHEDULED ) which results in no allocated containers in the response when allocate is called subsequently in AMContainerAllocatedTransition. 

FifoScheduler ( unlike Capacity scheduler ) does not have a synchronized block in Scheduler#allocate per application which have otherwise prevented the above from happening.

This message is automatically generated., I was wondering how to fix this till I saw your patch.

Patch is inline with my understanding of the race condition.

I'm fine with not having a test for this race. +1 for the patch., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Hitesh!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit #156 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-0.23-Commit/156/])
