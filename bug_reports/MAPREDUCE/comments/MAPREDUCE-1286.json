This message is automatically generated., OK, can somebody commit this please?  It's kind of trivial, but all the more reasons to close it., The double quotes were added intentionally in MAPREDUCE-1086, but removing them looks OK.

+1 I committed this. Thanks, Yuri!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #196 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/196/])
    , I would vote to declare this as blocker for 0.20.

It not only affects hadoop streaming, but also system calls using the hadoop command line utility will fail like:
