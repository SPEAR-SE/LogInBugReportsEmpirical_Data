[Correction, the mapred failure about the historyserver is caused because mapreduce.jobhistory.adddress was accidentally left out of the cluster configuration.  After adding it back in, it now fails like this:

So both fail trying to get logs out of /tmp.  Interestingly the paths both are trying to access are significantly different, and the only actual directory directly underneath /tmp/ in HDFS is /tmp/hadoop-yarn/.
, bq. Job History Server is not configured.
Jason, does it behave the same if the JobHistory server address is configured for the client ?, Comment race.  It acts differently when the server address is configured in that it tries to access an HDFS path, but the path isn't the same as with "yarn logs" and it still fails., For mapred logs
bq. the only actual directory directly underneath /tmp/ in HDFS is /tmp/hadoop-yarn/
Is log aggregation enabled for the cluster?I don't think the client code for mapred job -logs checks.
, No, log aggregation was not enabled for the cluster.  Enabling it allows "mapred job -logs" to grab the log successfully, so it looks like we need to update mapred logs to check if it's enabled and provide an appropriate error message if it isn't.

Enabling log aggregation had no effect on "yarn logs" as it still fails tying to access /tmp/logs/application_*_*/ instead of /tmp/logs/someuser/logs/application_*_*/ where the logs actually reside.
, @Jason,
 Good thought on the better error message. Lets make sure we cover most of the corner cases in logs and log aggregation. 
, Patch to address both the yarn logs issue and better error messages when log aggregation not enabled.

yarn logs problem was a copy-n-paste error grabbing the wrong property when computing the log dir suffix.  To improve the error messages, it catches FileNotFound to print an error about aggregation rather than pass along the exception to the end user., +1.
