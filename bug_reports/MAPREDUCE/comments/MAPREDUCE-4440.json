This message is automatically generated., All I have had time for so far is a quick look through the code.  I will try to find time to go more in-depth, although most everything seems to be fairly straight forward refactoring.

My first question is what does "FiCa" stand for? 

It looks like you left some DUMMY_APPLICATION_ATTEMPT_NUMBER debugging code inside RMAppImpl.java, if it is not debugging I need to look more closely at what it is doing.

Inside FSSchedulerApp could you add in @Override for the methods that implement/override SchedulerApplication methods. And similarly for FSSchedulerNode and SchedulerNode.



, Thanks Bobby, I'll add the @Override. The change in RMAppImpl is just to get the test (TestRMClientService) happy., I am still curious what FiCa Stands for in FiCaSchedulerApp and FiCaSchedulerNode and in the fica package as well. , Fixed javadoc/javac warnings and added @Override as suggested by Bobby., Ah, sorry. It's a bad name for fifo-capacity... couldn't come up with a better one! :), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., OK so the FiCa classes are only shared between those two and not the Fair Scheduler, hence the new package and everything.  Makes since.  I will try to dig in more deeply.  It might be nice to add in a package-info.java or some JavaDocs for those classes explaining this, just so someone new can look at them and understand what these classes are for.

I will try to dig into it more deeply soon. , OK I have been looking into the patch more deeply.

I understand now what DUMMY_APPLICATION_ATTEMPT_NUMBER is for.  Inside RMAppImpl.createAndGetApplicationReport there appears to be a bug. if allowAcces is true and currentAttempt != null currentApplicationAttemptId is set to the correct value, and then reset to the dummy value a few lines later.  that Dummy value then gets used at the end of the method in building the application report.  I think we want an else in front of {code}currentApplicationAttemptId = 
            BuilderUtils.newApplicationAttemptId(this.applicationId, 
                DUMMY_APPLICATION_ATTEMPT_NUMBER);{code}

Other then that I am a +1., Thanks for the review Bobby and for catching the snafu, fixed now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
