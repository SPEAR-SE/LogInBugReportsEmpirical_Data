[Here's patch to fix this:
 - Changed MR App's ContainerLauncher to use the Container given by the RM
 - Changed an existing test-case to also validate NodeId, port etc. This test passes with the code changes and fails without., Updated patch removing unused field in TaskAttemptImpl., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Maybe save the container object itself instead of saving most fields in TA?
A TA specific unit test that literally checks that the container object sent to TA via container assigned == container object TA sends out to ContainerLauncher? I am hoping container launcher itself is not creating a copy :P, Updated patch addressing the review comments.

The new tests passes with the code changes and fails without., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Reuse TA.getNodeId() instead of duplicating code?
{code}
-        + "] using containerId: [" + containerID + " on NM: ["
-        + containerMgrAddress + "]");
+        + "] using containerId: [" + container.getId() + " on NM: ["
+        + StringInterner.weakIntern(container.getNodeId().toString()) + "]");

+          taskAttempt.container.getId(), StringInterner
+              .weakIntern(taskAttempt.container.getNodeId().toString()),
{code}

Unnecessary variable?
{code}
+      Container container = cEvent.getContainer();
+      taskAttempt.container = container;
{code}

Looks like there is still some avoidable copying happening in ContainerRemoteLauchEvent and its base and in ContainerLaunchImpl.Container but we may leave it for a later date., TA.getNodeId() takes a readLock again, it's not a big deal but is unnecessary and so I avoided it.

The container field is also needed once again in the same method, not a big deal again, I'll let it be.

I'm checking this in to unblock YARN-571., I committed this to trunk and branch-2.
