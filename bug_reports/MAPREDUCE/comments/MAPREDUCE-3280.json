[bq. Once that is done, we can remove the default value for mapreduce.job.user.name from mapred-default.xml
This would still be needed once the job completes right ? JobHistory and the associated conf file., Sure, the current problem is that AM depends on the value written out by the client. Which is wrong, a security hole., I was wrong. The AM indeed already gets the user-name from the RM via env and sets it in its own conf. The history conf also gets it correctly. I'll verify this by removing the configuration and close this ticket if that works., Save for YarnChild which was depending on the user-name, the code doesn't need this.

The current integration test TestMRJobs validates this already., Looks good to me.
One change though, MiniMRYarnCluster shouldn't be setting this parameter any longer.  {{conf.set(MRJobConfig.USER_NAME, System.getProperty("user.name"));}} , bq. MiniMRYarnCluster shouldn't be setting this parameter any longer.
