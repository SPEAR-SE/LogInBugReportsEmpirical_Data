This message is automatically generated., The the following to variables should be 'volatile':

    public static int counter = 0;
    public static int failureCounter = 0;

Instead looping/sleeping 1000ms I'do it for 50ms, as this is done 4 times we are cutting an avg of 2 secs (max 4secs) the test.

, Thanks Robert. I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2. The patch for branch-1 seems to have an issue and fails with:

{code}
Testsuite: org.apache.hadoop.mapred.NotificationTestCase
Tests run: 1, Failures: 1, Errors: 0, Time elapsed: 0.005 sec

Testcase: warning took 0.002 sec
	FAILED
Class org.apache.hadoop.mapred.NotificationTestCase has no public constructor TestCase(String name) or TestCase()
junit.framework.AssertionFailedError: Class org.apache.hadoop.mapred.NotificationTestCase has no public constructor TestCase(String name) or TestCase()
{code}

Would you please check this?

, {{NotificationTestCase}} is abstract; its the parent class for the {{TestClusterMRNotification}} and {{TestLocalMRNotification}} tests.  If you run those two test classes, it should work.  , Dah!!.
