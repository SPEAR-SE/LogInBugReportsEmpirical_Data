[I forgot the mention the command I use:
mvn -Pdist -Pnative -Psrc -Dtar -DskipTests -DskipTest -DskipITs install

Maven is Apache Maven 3.0.3, I was able to reproduce this error using the command above by adding the site goal.

, Patch is for both trunk and 23, toc preparse the headers first so the real error message was showing up but was misleading the source line of the error. 

Each section +---+ must begin with a level 2 section header * and not a level 3 section header **, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
