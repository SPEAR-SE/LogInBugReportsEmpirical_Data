[Seems like hdfs-trunk doesn't compile as well. When ant is run, build fails with:
BUILD FAILED
/foo/hdfs-trunk/build.xml:257: Error while expanding /foo/hdfs-trunk/lib/hadoop-mapred-0.22.0-dev.jar, build.xml is looking for jars with "0.22.0-dev" as version, but trunk/lib/ has jars with name containing "0.21.0-dev"

Just renaming the jars in lib/ to have "0.22.0-dev" is solving the build issue., Issue is only in trunk. Not in 0.21 branch., hdfs-trunk seems fine(I don't see the issue Devaraj mentioned above). Could some other JIRA fixed hdfs build issue ?, I updated the common and hdfs jars with the current ones., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #60 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/60/])
    . Fix the libraries for common and hdfs. (omalley)
