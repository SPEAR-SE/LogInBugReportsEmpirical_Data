[Straight-fwd patch, I've fixed INSTALL too., FYI, not only that maven complains, but parameterized project <version> elements getting the property from the parent are unusable when deployed in a Maven repo.

, Alejandro - is the updated patch reasonable? Thanks., Actually the maven complaints in this case is bogus as the actual deployed pom is target/saner-pom.xml with version substituted. The current POMs are very CI friendly (see discussion in [MNG-2971|http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2971]). The patch makes CI almost impossible. Make sure Giri take a look at this :)

Also, even if we want to get rid of version properties to appease the bogus complaints, this patch is not OK, as it's not maven versions plugin friendly., Simpler patch based on Luke's comments., +1 on the v2 patch. Opening a jira for MRv2 classpath management :) , Thanks for the review Luke.

I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #785 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/785/])
