[Looking into the backlog, it seems this issue looks into the problem highlighted in my issue, although the patch seems overcomplicated.

Suppressing split.getStart() > 0 and changing 
WHERE dbif_rno to stricly greater rather than >= fixes all problems IMHO., [~jserdaru], we also run this problem. As you mentioned, Oracle sql is different from MySQL which uses row offset. Uploaded a patch to fix this problem., [~ywskycn] 's patch looks good to me. His patch used getEnd() instead of getStart() + getLength(); in the SQL Query, which simplified the old code., Also upload a patch for branch 1., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
