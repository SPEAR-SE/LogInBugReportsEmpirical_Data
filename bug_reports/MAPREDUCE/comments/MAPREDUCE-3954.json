This message is automatically generated., Mostly looks good. And thanks for updating the docs. A couple minor documentation nits.  

- can you update the comment Environment Variables section at the top of bin/yarn for the new variables
- you might add a header to the table in the ClusterSetup - with Daemon | Environment Variable
- You didn't change this so its optional. It might be nice in ClusterSetup to say that you configure it size in MB but you leave off the m. Because when I read that I thought I would set the env var to 1000MB., Looks good to me too, besides comments from Thomas.

+1 for comments (1) and (3) above. Cannot understand (2). Canceling the patch to address these comments., I addressed the comments.  

* I updated the comment in the yarn command.  I even remved the YARN_NAMENODE_OPTS section that looks like a copy and paste error.
* I added the header to the table in the documentation.
* I made it clearer in the documentation that you set the variable to be 1000 and not 1000MB. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Updating patch fixing a small typo. Not running it through Jenkins.

+1. Pushing this the updated patch., bq.  The test failures are unrelated, we have to investigate separately.
Figured this as a Jenkins issue. Happens intermittently, perhaps because of some permissions issues., Just committed this to trunk, branch-0.23 and branch-0.23.2. Thanks Robert!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #629 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/629/])
