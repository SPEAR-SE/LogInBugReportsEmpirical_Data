, I committed this to trunk and branch-2 as part of YARN-486. Thanks Xuan!, Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #181 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/181/])
    YARN-486. Changed NM's startContainer API to accept Container record given by RM as a direct parameter instead of as part of the ContainerLaunchContext record. Contributed by Xuan Gong.
MAPREDUCE-5139. Update MR AM to use the modified startContainer API after YARN-486. Contributed by Xuan Gong. (Revision 1467063)

, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #1397 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1397/])
    YARN-486. Changed NM's startContainer API to accept Container record given by RM as a direct parameter instead of as part of the ContainerLaunchContext record. Contributed by Xuan Gong.
MAPREDUCE-5139. Update MR AM to use the modified startContainer API after YARN-486. Contributed by Xuan Gong. (Revision 1467063)

     Result = SUCCESS
