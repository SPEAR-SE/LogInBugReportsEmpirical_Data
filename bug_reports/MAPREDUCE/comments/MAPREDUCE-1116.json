[This will also delay releasing the slot till localization (for the killed task) finishes., To solve this, we will need checks for task-status at various stages like job localization, task localization, and localization code in TaskRunner.

We may also want to wish to interrupt the download of files themselves from DFS.

Note that the jvm itself will not be launched anymore because of already existing checks in JvmManager., We may also then have to clean-up partially localized files - particularly for distributed cache.]
