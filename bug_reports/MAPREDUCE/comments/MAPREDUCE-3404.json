[I have two corrections to make and three observation.

* Corrections:
** The property name that controls mapper speculative execution is {{mapreduce.map.speculative}} rather than
{{mapreduce.job.maps.speculative.execution}}.
** The property name that controls reduce speculative execution is {{mapreduce.reduce.speculative}} rather than
{{mapreduce.job.reduces.speculative.execution}}.
* Observations:
** If the config values are set as follows in the _mapred-site.xml_ file, then overriding of {{mapreduce.map.speculative}}
works as expected on the command line:
{noformat}
  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.map.speculative</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.reduce.speculative</name>
    <value>false</value>
  </property>
{noformat}
*** That is, -Dmapreduce.map.speculative=false on the command line will override the value in the config file and turn
off speculative map execution.
** However, if mapreduce.reduce.speculative is set to true in the config file (as in the following example), it is not
possible to turn off speculative *map* execution on the command line. For some reason, setting
mapreduce.reduce.speculative to true in the config file overrides the command line value of mapreduce.map.speculative
{noformat}
  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.map.speculative</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>

  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.reduce.speculative</name>
    <value>true</value>
  </property>
{noformat}
** Also, if the config file sets {{mapreduce.map.speculative}} to {{false}} but leaves {{mapreduce.reduce.speculative}} set to {{true}}, the speculative execution still happens for the mappers even though {{mapreduce.reduce.speculative}} is {{false}}. So, this is not just a command line override issue.
, In addition to the new unit test, I have successfully tested this patch on a 10-node cluster., I have a couple of comments.

# In your test TestSpeculativeExecution.java line 65 (I think) and also later in the file, there is some code commented out.  It should probably just be deleted. 
# In the mapper code that checks for the first attempt of the first mapper, I would prefer to see it not do a string comparison as that value could change in the future.  I would rather see it check the individual parts of the ID though the APIs it provides.
# Why are you calling Thread.currentThread() right before the call to sleep()?  this should probably be deleted.
# It looks like there might be some tabs in the patch.  Please replace them with spaces.
# The boolean expression {code}
          (   ( conf.getBoolean(MRJobConfig.MAP_SPECULATIVE, false)
                && (tType == null || tType == TaskType.MAP) )
           || ( conf.getBoolean(MRJobConfig.REDUCE_SPECULATIVE, false)
              && (tType == null || tType == TaskType.REDUCE))           ) ) {
{code} is so complex that you needed comment to explain what it was doing.  Also those conf values are not going to change from the time that the AM is launched.  Could you please cache them.  I think it would clean up the expression a lot.
# When will tType be null? and why do we want to pass it on to the Speculator when it is?  I dug and it looks like it is null when the event type is JOB_CREATE or ATTEMPT_STATUS_UPDATE, but it would be good to document that in the javadocs for the Speculator interface (So that others can override that functionality in the future).  It would also be cleaner imo to have the tType == null check be in a different place form the tType == Map or tType == REDUCE.  But I really don't care so long as there is a comment explaining what is happening.

@Mahadev:

I added a test case that covers speculation for reduces only.

The speculator handles map and reduce speculation separately. I just looked at the patch, and it achieves the above by not sending any map events to the speculative when map-speculation is disabled. The speculator doesn't seem to find any maps to speculates (as it doesn't know about any maps at all) and so only speculates reduces. Works (IMO) a convoluted way but can live with that.

+1 for the patch. Pushing this in., ..oh, and the tests look good too.

Just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Eric!

On a side note, not caused by this patch, it is not correct that we increment the num_failed_maps counter when the speculation kills a task. Instead we should have a num_killed_maps.
