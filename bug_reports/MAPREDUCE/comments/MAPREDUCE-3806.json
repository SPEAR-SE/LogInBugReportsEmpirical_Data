[Gridmix depends on {{jackson 1.8}}. This dependency was introduced by MAPREDUCE-778. It seems like another version of jackson (probably jackson 1.7) is added to the classpath and is taking precedence. A quick search for this jackson version points to the {{hadoop-yarn}} folder. But I dont see any mention of jackson in {{hadoop-yarn}}., I found some interesting link on this issue. Read http://stackoverflow.com/questions/6537287/jersey-and-jackson-maven-dependency-issues. It seems like Ravi replaced all the jackson-1.7.1 jars with jackson-1.8.8 in the {{build/ivy/lib/gridmix/test}} folder and found that this test passes. Actually he copied the jackson-1.8.8 as jackson1.7.1., I replaced jackson-core-asl-1.7.1.jar with jackson-core-asl-1.8.8.jar in ~/.m2/.... and in ~/.ivy2/...
This new jar is picked up and copied to build/ivy/lib/gridmix/test/ and used and the testcase passes., I suspect this is fixed by HADOOP-8104., stale]
