[The problem of course is that TextInputFormat returns the offset as the key and the line as the value.

How about creating a new InputFormat (maybe named LineInputFormat?) that returns a Text, and a NullWritable? With the change, I'm putting into HADOOP-2425, with the IdentityMapper and IdentityReducer would precisely sort the input files. I would even propose that we make LineInputFormat the default eventually, after deprecating TextInputFormat., There is already a proper input format class: KeyValueTextInputFormat for generating 
the first field as the key and the rest as the value.

I , Closing this as fixed for a variety of reasons (alternative provided, you can now provide your own input format, etc, etc)]
