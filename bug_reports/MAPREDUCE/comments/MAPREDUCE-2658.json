[Ahmed - do you plan to update the INSTALL docs?, The attached patch resolves the described issue by removing "local" as the default value for the "mapreduce.jobtracker.address" property from mapred-default.xml, and also in evaluating the isLocal flag in the ReduceTask class.

All unit tests ran successfully, Arun- No I thought it'll be weird to ask the user as part of the install docs to put a value for "mapreduce.jobtracker.address" where there is no jobtracker at all. The patch I submitted addresses that by modifying the mapred-default.xml and ReduceTask.java., Ahmad - the patch to ReduceTask isn't appropriate.

We should consider using the serviceloader stuff rather than mapreduce.jobtracker.address in the reduce task, want to take  look? Thanks., Thanks Arun, I'll take a look. I think this will require considering the MAPREDUCE-2400 recent changes. Any other issues I should also consider?, Sorry, I missed this. It was fixed via MAPREDUCE-3004., Thanks Arun, I saw it fixed but missed closing this ticket.]
