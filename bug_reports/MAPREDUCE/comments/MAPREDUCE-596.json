[Apparently this issue is still around.  When trying to distribute a .zip file with -file I end up with a job jar structure something like this...

Archive:  job_201004151121_0002.jar
  inflating: load_diff.py            
  inflating: getmaps.py              
  inflating: lib/warehouse.zip       
  inflating: envs.cfg
  ...

For some reason, the zip file ends up in the lib/ directory.  When I change the extension to .zipp the file ends up in the top level like I'd expect it to.

Archive:  job_201004151121_0004.jar
  inflating: load_diff.py            
  inflating: getmaps.py              
  inflating: warehouse.zipp          
  inflating: envs.cfg 
  ...

Any particular reason for this?, zip file is packaged under lib directory. Documentation is updated in MAPREDUCE-1697.
