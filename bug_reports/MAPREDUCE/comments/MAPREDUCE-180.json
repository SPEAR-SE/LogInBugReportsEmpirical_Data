[
I ran a large job on our cluster over the weekend. At some point, some map tasks were re-run successfully. However, when trying to handle the reducers requests to fetch mapoutput files of those map tasks, the http server complained file not found.  That caused the map tasks to be reported as having been lost, and failed.

This happened multiple times on different machines for the same map task until the job tracker aborted the job. 

, 
The problem was due to config file update during the job running. The job tracker used the original version, but the newly launched tasks used the new one. The new config file specifies a new mapred.local.dir which the task tracker was not aware. When requests came for the mapoutput files, the task tracker generated wrong file names.

Solution suggestions: The child process should inherit config data from the task tracker in order to keep config data consistency.

 , This isn't an issue anymore.]
