[Hey Arun,

I noticed the float cast from HADOOP-3521 still exists. Should we consider reverting it or leave it as is? I do not have much history here other than what I could grasp from discussions, so I'm deferring to you.

Thanks!, I'm going to close this as stale given the metrics system was rewritten.]
