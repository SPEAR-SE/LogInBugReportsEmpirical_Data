This message is automatically generated., Hi, Chuan.  Can you list a sample of the tests that were fixed by this patch in your environment?  I'd like to take it for a test run., Hi Chris, the following tests fail on my machine.

* TestClusterMRNotification
* TestJobCleanup
* TestJobCounters
* TestJobOutputCommitter
* TestMROldApiJobs
* TestSpeculativeExecution

You may need to delete the stating directory on your local drive to repro the failure.
The user running the tests need to be an Administrators group user.
Error message looks like the following for me.

{noformat}
testSpeculativeExecution(org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.TestSpeculativeExecution)  Time elapsed: 22109 sec  <<< ERROR!
java.io.IOException: The ownership on the staging directory E:/tmp/hadoop-yarn/staging/chuanliu/.staging is not as expected. It is owned by Administrators. The directory must be owned by the submitter chuanliu or by chuanliu

This explains why I wasn't seeing the problem earlier.  I've been running as a non-admin user.  I've verified that the tests still pass when running as a non-admin user.

+1 for the patch.  I'll commit this.
