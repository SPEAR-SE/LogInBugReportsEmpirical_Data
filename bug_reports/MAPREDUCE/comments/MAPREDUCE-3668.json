[A quick fix that comes to mind is to catch and ignore AccessControlExcpetions on the client side, but there is a bigger underlying issue.

"job -list" going to each and every AM is not going to scale. As part of MAPREDUCE-3476, I am moving all the per-AM information to "job -status".

I am going to work on MAPREDUCE-3476 soon, but if that gets late, we can push the quick fix in., The quick fix doesn't exactly meet their needs, since in the past everyone could at least see jobs were running.  The quick fix would prevent a user from seeing anything but their own jobs (barring ACL exceptions), and some of the tests submit jobs as various users then later monitors their status with this command.

For now QE can make progress setting the view-job ACL to *, but it would be nice to have a real fix., With the ACL workaround it appears we can wait for MAPREDUCE-3476, so assigning to Vinod.  If there's something I can do to help out with MAPREDUCE-3476 or any work in this area necessary beyond that patch, please let me know., This is fixed after MAPREDUCE-3720 removed the per-AM information from "job -list". Closing this as duplicate.]
