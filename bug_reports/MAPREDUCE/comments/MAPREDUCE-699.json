[Strangely, all the streaming tests passed on my local box, All of the recent patch builds fail on hudson. 7 tests for streaming fail with NPE. Examples :
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Mapreduce-Patch-vesta.apache.org/366/
http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Mapreduce-Patch-vesta.apache.org/365/, This seems to be specific to the patch setup since http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/ is building just fine. What is the difference in those two setups?, I just blew away the Hudson workspace for this patch build to see if that fixes it., The failures are not seen anymore. Closing this.]
