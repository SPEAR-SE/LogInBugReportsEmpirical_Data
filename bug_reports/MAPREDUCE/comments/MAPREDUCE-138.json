[I propose we bite the bullet and introduce an enum TaskType {MAP, REDUCE, SETUP, CLEANUP} while we fix this... , +1 for separate map, reduce, cleanup and setup TIPs. 
Now the cleanup and setup tips occupy map/reduce slot whichever is free. I think we should have separate slot for cleanup and setup tasks sothat they can be launched asap., I am +1 for the enum for TaskTypes.

There are two approaches to having slots for the setup/cleanup tasks -
1) Have a special slot in the TT for all the special tasks - JobSetup, JobCleanup and TaskCleanup. This special slot can run any of the special tasks. With this setup, we have three types of slots in the TT - Map, Reduce, and Setup/Cleanup slot.
2) Have the Map slots in the TT be floating between the actual maps and the special tasks. In this model, one would configure #Reduce slots in the TT, and "#other slots".

The other thing that I am thinking of removing is the reuse of taskattemptID for the cleanup tasks (as implemented in HADOOP-4759). Made the code hard to read/maintain. 

Thoughts?
, One more thing - schedulers would be made aware of these special tasks.., Stale.]
