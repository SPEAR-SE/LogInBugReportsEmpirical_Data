[The documentation doesn't say the capacities are limited to integers either. Does this warrant a change to the documentation?, I do think it is good if we can be explicit about the supported input format for the config params., Adding a patch that mentions capacities can be floats. Didn't test as it is tiny change to documentation, No tests include as it is a tiny documentation change., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
