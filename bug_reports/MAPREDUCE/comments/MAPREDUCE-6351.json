[Attached the logs (container log, thread dumps, jstat output) for reference.

Please note that, my thoughts on threading issue may be premature and incorrect. Irrespective of this analysis problem exists., "Threads analysis" mentioned in description above found to be incorrect when I retrace the code flow. Pre-notification is not a problem as merger wait is guarded by size check.

However, problem exists, fetchers are not proceeding and waiting for merger to free some memory and merge doing nothing., I suspect this is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-6334.  I see a lot of these types of messages in the reducer log:
{noformat}
2015-05-01 19:59:37,632 WARN [fetcher#13] org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.task.reduce.Fetcher: Shuffle output from glgs1190.grid.uh1.inmobi.com:13562 failed, retry it.
{noformat}

I think it is leaking memory allocations from the shuffle errors and the shuffle buffer runs out of available memory (hence fetchers told to WAIT) but there isn't enough data in the shuffle buffer to trigger a merge.  All of the memory that was leaked will never complete to kick off the merge and unblock the other threads., Thanks a lot Jason for details. We are hitting exactly same scenario (disk bad) as explained in MAPREDUCE-6334.
We will try the patch and update the details in this jira.
