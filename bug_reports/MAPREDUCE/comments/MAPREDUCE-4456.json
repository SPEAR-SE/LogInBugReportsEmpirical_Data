[This happens if there are two or more things in the cache request that have the same symlink.  This is because it becomes a key to a map, so the dupes are dropped., This patch adds in several new tests to validate the class.  It also moves where the symlinks are made to be right after the data is downloaded., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Canceling patch to address test failure., OK So the test looks like it is bogus.  It expects that only URIs with a fragment will have a symlink created, but that is not how 1.0 works, nor is it how 2.0 works.  If symlink creation is enabled then everything will get a link.  If no fragment is given, then it is the name of the file or directory that is being downloaded.  

I did notice one potential issue, though.  mapred.create.symlink and the more up to date mapreduce.job.cache.symlink.create are now ignored in trunk and 2.0.  symlinks are always created no matter what.  I am going to file a separate JIRA for that.  I don't know if it is a concern or not.  , Ok so I am wrong.  1.0 will not create a symlink without the #.  I just didn't realize that streaming was adding in the # by default.  So the test is correct as per 1.0 behavior, but not 2.0 behavior., I filed MAPREDUCE-4493 to deal with the inconsistencies between mrv1 and mrv2.  I think this JIRA needs to be on hold until I can get the other one working properly., After talking with Arun on MAPREDUCE-4493.  He feels that the current MR2 behavior is correct, and we should just document the differences.  I am fine with going that rout so I will just update the test to expect the new behavior, and then document that behavior on the other JIRA. , This patch fixes the test failure., -1 overall.
