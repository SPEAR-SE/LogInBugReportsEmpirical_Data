This message is automatically generated., Hi, Chuan.  There is another similar method in {{TypeConverter}} that converts a YARN {{ApplicationReport}} to a {{JobStatus}}.  That one is setting start time, but not finish time.  Do you want to fix that one too?

For the test, do you want to add an assertion that {{jobStatus.getFinishTime()}} has the expected value?
, Nice catch! I did not check the other method when preparing the first patch. Attach a new one that also fixes the other method and adds some more asserts to the tests., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
