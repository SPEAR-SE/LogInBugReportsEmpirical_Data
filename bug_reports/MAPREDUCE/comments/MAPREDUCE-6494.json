[The changes are mostly just from indenting and moving a few things around.  Otherwise, the "real" change is only deleting the directory., Why is this using /tmp and not the user's working directory as provided by YARN?, It uses
{code}
Path remoteRootLogDir = new Path(conf.get(
        YarnConfiguration.NM_REMOTE_APP_LOG_DIR,
        YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_REMOTE_APP_LOG_DIR));
    Path workingDir = new Path(remoteRootLogDir, "archive-logs-work");
{code}
and {{YarnConfiguration.DEFAULT_NM_REMOTE_APP_LOG_DIR}} is {{/tmp/logs}}, so the working dir becomes {{/tmp/logs/archive-logs-work}} (by default)., \\

This message was automatically generated., What would happen if we run two instances of this concurrently? Should we also make it easy for the user to realize that its happening to avoid issues? Maybe we could we use the existence of the directory as a sign that someone else is running it., That's a good idea.  The tool is designed to only run one instance at a time, and we put off enforcing that to figure out later.  This sounds like a good way to do that.  If the working directory already exists, then the tool can print out a message explaining that.  I'll also add a {{-force}} option that will delete the directory in case it's incorrectly there somehow., The 002 patch uses the working dir to prevent multiple calls to the tool and the {{-force}} option as described in my previous comment., \\

This message was automatically generated., +1. Nice test case., We actually found one last permissions issue.  If using the DefaultContainerExecutor, the shells are run as the Yarn user who won't have permission to operate on the temp dir when it's permissions are using 700.  The 003 patch changes it to use 770 permissions to fix this., \\

This message was automatically generated., These are same as the normal log directory permissions used by LogAggregationService. So looks good.
