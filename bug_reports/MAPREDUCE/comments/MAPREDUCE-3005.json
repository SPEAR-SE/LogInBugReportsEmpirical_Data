[I am generally averse to null checks, but this one seems valid, Arun can you please confirm this fix? We do remove rack-entries from the requests-table when there are no longer any requests against that rack (in the same method, AppSchedulingInfo.allocateNodeLocal(), but in previous scheduling cycle).

Will get this verified on the cluster. Will see if I can add a test too., +1 for the patch.

Normally, the MR AM shouldn't have outstanding node-local requests without rack-local requests. But this fix is valid for lots of scenarios., Thinking about it some more...

We also need to fix LeafQueue.canAssign to ensure it returns 'false' for node-local allocations when rackRequest is null or rackRequest.getNumContainers() == 0. This prevents allocations on nodes which are on racks on which apps don't need containers., My averseness to null-checks is vindicated :)

Arun, can you please provide a patch? Thanks!, Preliminary patch, I'll test on cluster, add unit tests etc., Same fix, after testing. Also added a unit test., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
