[I think a tip's  start time will be missing. Tip's start time is different from attempt's start time. Tip-start-time is the time when the jobtracker schedules the first attempt from the tip while attempt-start-time is the time when the tracker start executing the attempt. I dont think we can recover the exact tip-start-time but the best we can do is approximate it to the first/oldest attempt's start time. Thoughts?, A straight forward fix. Testing in progress., This has gone stale, and has not been seen recently. With MR2, I do not think this is an issue.]
