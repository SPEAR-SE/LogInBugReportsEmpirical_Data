Given that the NPE was caught, and throwing an exception is about the only course of action, this could be viewed as working as intended. Alternatively, JobProfile could so some better validation of data and fail with something more meaningful. But is the extra performance hit (and extra test) worth the effort?, Probably not.

Closing as stale.]
