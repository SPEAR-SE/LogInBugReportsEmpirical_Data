[Yes, we don't need to create the array., I forgot to mention in the issue but creating OneFileInfo is performing a side-effect of fetching file infos, which, in cases where one is accessing a remote service (s3 for example) might actually give a performance hit, The array itself is not used, but the act of filling in the array appears to have side-effects that are important.  For example, {{rackToNodes}} appears to be initialized during the construction of the array.

 , Attached a sample patch.

I agree with Jason that creating OneFileInfo instance is required. However, I'm thinking the array itself is not needed.]
