[Jira is for reporting bugs and not for asking bugs. Please use the user mailing lists for questions such as this., It could be a bug, for Hadoop not splitting compressed data correctly using NLineInputFormat. 
Same question have been posted to hadoop user mailing list with no answer. 

If you do not think it is a bug, can you explain why it is NOT?, see my comments, bq. It could be a bug, for Hadoop not splitting compressed data correctly using NLineInputFormat. 
The description of the jira made it sound like you were asking a question. There are many such jiras created in Hadoop where jira is misused for asking questions. Perhaps this could be a bug. So reopening is the right thing to do. I will ask someone with more mapreduce background to comment on this.

I am also moving this to jira to MapReduce.]
