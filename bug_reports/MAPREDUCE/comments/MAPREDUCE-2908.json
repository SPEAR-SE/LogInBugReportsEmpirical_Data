This is due to MAPREDUCE-2942.

All the findBugs warnings are reported to have been fixed by this patch. It is ready for review/commit., This looks like a step forward to me. +1. What was the motivation behind renaming Queue to AbstractQueue in the capacity scheduler?, bq. What was the motivation behind renaming Queue to AbstractQueue in the capacity scheduler?
Yeah, that was the only big change, I should've commented about it before itself. This was to address a findBugs warning which complained that _o.a.h.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.Queue_ implements the top level _o.a.h.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.Queue_ and shares the same name but different packages. I myself did find it to be confusing, so renamed it instead of excluding it from the warning list., Maybe we should call it CSQueue rather than AbstractQueue?, Changed AbstractQueue to CSQueue., -1 overall.
