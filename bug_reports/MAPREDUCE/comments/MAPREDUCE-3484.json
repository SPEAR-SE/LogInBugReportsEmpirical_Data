[This is the exception we noticed. Although 2 more retries were left, the InterruptedException caused the notification to not happen.

Does anyone know if I'm seeing the InterruptedException because the NM is trying to reclaim resources? i.e. did it try killing the AM process?
, Last patch was wrong. These are the changes. I need to add tests still, Could someone please review and commit this patch?, bq. Does anyone know if I'm seeing the InterruptedException because the NM is trying to reclaim resources?
The interruption is because the dispatcher itself is going to be exited as part of stop.

+1 for moving the notification before stop().

Looking at the patch now., Patch looks good to me. +1.

I was concerned about use cases like oozie which act on the notification url and request JobCounters on notification, but I think we are fine because
 - if the notification is received by oozie and the AM is still alive, AM will directly respond to the request for counters
 - if the notification is received but the AM is gone by then, it'd mean that history is properly written and JobHistoryServer can respond to the request.

There is a small corner case when AM sends the notification but crashes before completely writing the JobHistory. In this case, the client/oozie will see the job as successful via RPC/UI, but cannot get any information. This is an orthogonal bug, I'll create a separate ticket.

At any rate, I think we are missing an integration test for job-end notification feature. We need to modify/port {{NotificationTestCase}} to work with {{MiniMRYarnCluster}}. Will open a ticket for that too., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
