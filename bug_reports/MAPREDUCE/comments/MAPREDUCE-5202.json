[May be you should leave a comment on MAPREDUCE-4397.., I reverted the previous patch on branch-1, branch-1.1, and branch-1.2., Does this mean hadoop 1.1.3 would be released soon ?, As I pointed out on the security mailing list, MAPREDUCE-4397 and its equivalent in 2+, does NOT "significantly" weakens Hadoop security. To avoid going to the details, this is analogous to having a plastic deposit box inside a safe. The _additional_ "weakness" only comes in when the safe is opened. Reverting MAPREDUCE-4397 simply replace the plastic box inside the safe with the original tin box, which is also trivial to open once the safe is opened., added 1.2.0 to fixVersion, per CHANGES.txt and above comments., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
