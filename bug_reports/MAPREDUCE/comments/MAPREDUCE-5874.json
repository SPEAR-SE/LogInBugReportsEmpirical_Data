IMO, we should create MapReduce API section and MapredAppMasterRest.apt.vm should be also moved into the section., Created MapReduce API section and moved MapRedAppMasterRest into hadoop-mapreduce-client-core and HistoryServerRest into hadoop-mapreduce-client-fs., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

Here are three comments:
* HistoryServerRest.apt.vm looks deleted. You should {{git add}} the file and then create a patch.
* Please remove the dead links from YARN REST APIs section in site.xml.
* When moving HistoryServerRest.apt.vm to MapReduce REST APIs section, it would be better to change the sentence 
{code}
-  The history server REST API's allow the user to get status on finished applications. Currently it only supports MapReduce and provides information on finished jobs.
{code}
like
{code}
The history server REST API's allow the user to get status on finished MapReduce jobs.
{code}
because the document itself is now MapReduce-specific., +1 for reorganizing the web pages. For clarity, maybe it's better to say "Job History Server"  instead?

Move the ticket to MR, or "MR History Server" as the section header., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Would you remove the "Go Back" links in the both documents in addition? Since index.html does not exist in the both MapReduce projects, the links become dead.

  \[ {{{./index.html}Go Back}} \]

I can run the following command successfully:
{code}
$ mvn site; mvn site:stage -DstagingDirectory=/path/to/dir/
{code}, I did run mvn site prior to staging. The problem was that I was using maven 3.1.1. Switching to maven 3.2.1 fixed the issue.

I'm +1 on this change. I will commit it shortly. Thanks a lot Tsyoshi and Akira!, I've committed to trunk and branch-2]
