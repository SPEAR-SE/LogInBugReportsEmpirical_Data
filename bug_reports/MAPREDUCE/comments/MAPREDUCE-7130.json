[[~jonathan.bender] I think this bug was introduced by my change a couple of months later: MAPREDUCE-6892. Some new fields were introduced the jhist records. Is this urgent? I can take a look at this next week.
, [~pbacsko] not terribly urgent for me. I have a workaround at the moment but it would be great to handle those events it so I can include them in my job history metrics.]
