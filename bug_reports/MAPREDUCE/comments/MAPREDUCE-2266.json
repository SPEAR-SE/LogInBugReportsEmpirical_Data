[I took a peek at YDH and it looks like the solution used there is to defer the sleep/SIGKILL into a new DelayedProcessKiller thread. But I couldn't find any open source JIRA for this improvement. It would be appreciated if this patch could be contributed - otherwise I'm happy to forward port for trunk., Todd, I'll try and find the original author of the fix, but please feel free to forward port it. Thanks!, This needs to wait on forward-port of MAPREDUCE-2178 before it can really be done, Unblocking as MAPREDUCE-2767 removed LinuxTaskController., This is a bug in DefaultTaskController - you're going to want to include it, or else MR performance will have a giant regression., Todd. What do I include? If there was a patch I would be happy to., There's no patch, since this was dealt with by MAPREDUCE-2178 where JvmManager was substantially rewritten. I can't contribute time to the 0.22 release, since I'm concentrating on 0.23 and 0.20.20x release lines.]
