[Steps to reproduce:
- setup cluster from [these bits|https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-22-Build/]
- apply [simple configs|https://github.com/rvs/hdeploy/tree/master/conf]
- start cluster
- run TestDFSIO: 
{noformat}
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop jar $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-mapred-test-0.22.0-SNAPSHOT.jar TestDFSIO -write -nrFiles 100 -fileSize 10MB
{noformat}, You'll see the following error message
{noformat}
11/05/31 01:13:57 INFO util.NativeCodeLoader: Loaded the native-hadoop library

If the same test is executed with {{-jt jobtracker:port}} command line argument everything works fine.

It would seem like a configuration problem unless this is the only test/example with doesn't work properly. Sleep jobs, Pi, randomwriter jobs are working just fine., Turns out not a problem of the test. Rather the configuration was using an old way of configuring jobtracker address (mapred.job.tracker). Is this an intended behavior to simply ignore the old configuration parameter rather than issue a deprecation warning?, The deprecated config ought to work. When was this particular build from? Did it include the rather-recent fix for HADOOP-7287 (committed May 23)? If so and this still didn't work, it seems like a bug to me., I don't remember exact build numbers but they all were happening after 5/23 for sure.]
