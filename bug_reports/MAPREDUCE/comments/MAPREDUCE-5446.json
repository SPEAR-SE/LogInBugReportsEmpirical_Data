[Here's a patch that has MRApp.waitForState using waitForServiceToStop when waiting for the STOPPED state so it properly waits until the service has fully stopped.

My preference would be to rip out MRApp.waitForState(Service.STATE) completely and replace it with something like waitForStopped since it only appears to be used for that case.  However I'm not sure if there are downstream projects that are using MRApp, so this patch plays it safe by preserving the existing MRApp interface., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
