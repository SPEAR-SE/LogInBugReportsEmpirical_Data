[Attached the patch., The issue was : "when creating ReduceAttemptFinishedEvent, instead of passing nodeHostName for hostname, containerMgrAddress was passed"..
But creation of MapAttemptFinishedEvent is done in right way.Hence changed the code with respect to that.
, MAPREDUCE-3009 issue exists for this reduce task page also. Already submitted one patch for that issue., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This is trivial change. In Job History Page (Reduce Tasks -> Task ID -> Node link)
Earlier it was redirecting to wrong page (http://containerMgrAddress). It should be http://hostname, Little good patch. +1. Verified the bug without the patch and that the patch works on my single node setup.

Good job on finding out the root cause BTW *smile*, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1055 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1055/])
