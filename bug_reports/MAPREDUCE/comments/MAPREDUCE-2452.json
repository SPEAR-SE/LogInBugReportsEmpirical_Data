[Devaraj,
  Can you please have the Thread catch IOExceptions and log them. Throwable should be caught, logged, and call System.exit.

  I think you need to retry if the offer returns false rather than just dropping the cancel request.

, I should ideally put a small sleep between the retries whenever 'offer' returns false. That would need InterruptedException to be handled. I ideally don't want to swallow the InterruptedException but if I don't it leads to a big cascading change in the method declarations in the call hierarchy of the token cancellation method... I am in two minds on whether to swallow/ignore the interrupted exception or propagate it all the way up and effect a major change in the method signatures..., Patch addressing Owen's comments., Looking good. A few more points:

* Please have the cancelToken catch the InterruptedException and create a new RuntimeException that wraps it.
* Please have the DelegationTokenCancelThread catch InterruptedException and exit gracefully., Addresses Owen's comments.., +1, Patch for trunk, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
