No tests because this change only adds some shell scripts., Do we support pipes? I dont think we do on Windows. Probably should expose that as an option in the cmd script., >Do we support pipes? 
I am not very sure about this. Let me check this and get back to you., I checked that hadoop pipes indeed do not work on Windows. I have created MAPREDUCE-5331 to track the issue. Move pipes to unsupported in the new patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
