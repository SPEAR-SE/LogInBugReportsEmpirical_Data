[Hi,

Your job is submitting with its queue name set to 'default' (cause, its default and you have not changed it to queue{1-â€¦}).

This JIRA is for reporting genuinely determined bugs. What you have run into is simply a user error. I recommend hitting the mailing list (mapreduce-user@hadoop.apache.org) first for all your user problems, and only report bugs after you are sure.

For your current issue, which is not a bug, please re-read the tutorial section on how to use queues with your jobs: http://hadoop.apache.org/common/docs/current/mapred_tutorial.html#Submitting+Jobs+to+Queues, thank you!
