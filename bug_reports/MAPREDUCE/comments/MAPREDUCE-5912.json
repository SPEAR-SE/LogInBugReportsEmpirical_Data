This message is automatically generated., No new tests included because this is a revert of an earlier breaking change. Manually validated the change on Windows., As you identified in HADOOP-10663, returning the default filesystem for local paths is not correct., I also posted a patch that solves HADOOP-10663. I guess if that is accepted, this is obsolete., +1 for this patch.

[~rusanu], [~curino] and [~chris.douglas], my understanding is that MAPREDUCE-5196 accidentally introduced this bug, but this part of the change is not strictly necessary for the goals of MAPREDUCE-5196.  Based on that, I'm in favor of committing this patch to revert just the part of MAPREDUCE-5196 that caused the bug.  The alternative patch on the {{Path}} class posted in HADOOP-10663 has some other potential side effects, so I prefer doing a localized fix here in MR.  (I'll enter more details on HADOOP-10663.)

If in the future we want to revisit the idea of map outputs going somewhere different than the local file system, then I think we'd need a different patch.  I think we'd want to make sure that the map output's {{Path}} instance contains an explicit scheme, so that the code here doesn't need to assume local vs. default vs. something else.

Can you let me know if you agree with committing this and not committing HADOOP-10663?  I'll hold off on committing until I hear from one of you., bq. If in the future we want to revisit the idea of map outputs going somewhere different than the local file system, then I think we'd need a different patch.

Agreed. MAPREDUCE-5269 changed all {{Path}} instances returned from {{YARNOutputFiles}} to be fully qualified, but the two changes were separated.

+1 for committing the workaround until HADOOP-10663 is ready., I committed this patch to trunk.  Remus, thank you for contributing the fix., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5691 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5691/])
