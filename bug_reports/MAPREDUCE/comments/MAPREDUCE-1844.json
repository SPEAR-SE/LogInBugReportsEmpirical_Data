[Hdfs trunk shows no sign of using RefreshUserToGroupMappingsProtocol while commons trunk also has no file with the name RefreshUserToGroupMappingsProtocol.java. Maybe updating the hdfs snapshot jar in mapreduce trunk should solve this issue., Building common/hdfs, {{mvn-install}} targets, etc. worked for me. I assumed the snapshot hadn't updated yet, but perhaps the publishing is broken?, It looks like hdfs -mvn-system-install target is broken which inturn didnt allow the mvn-install task to publish hdfs artifacts in the last 6 days, Its the mvn-install target that publishes but the mvn-deploy target which didnt run in the last 6 days as the -mvn-system-install target is broken. , Filed a jira for the above said failure.
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HDFS-1193, Marking it as a blocker., Fixed by HDFS-1193]
