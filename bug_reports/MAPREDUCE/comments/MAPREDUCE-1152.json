[Currently JobTrackerInstrumentation.failed{Map/Reduce} accounts for killed map/reduce tasks as well. In other places also like in JobCounter.NUM_FAILED_MAPS, killed and failed both maps are accounted. So I propose to remove the JobTrackerInstrumentation.killed{Map/Reduce} API since in framework we do the metering as part of failed API., Straight forward patch., Hmm... shouldn't we fix metrics to correctly record KILLED tasks separately from FAILED ones? The proposal in this jira seems like the wrong direction... we probably need JobCounter.NUM_KILLED_{MAPS|REDUCES} counters too?, Patch fixing fail and kill task metrics., Patch looks fine to me.
