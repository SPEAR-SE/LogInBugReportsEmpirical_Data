This message is automatically generated., Test failures are because of MAPREDUCE-1834 and MAPREDUCE-1925, Some comments:
(1) In DumpTypedBytes.java, LoadTypedBytes.java and in HadoopStreaming.java, in printUsage(), "$HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-streaming.jar" is mentioned, which is not the correct path of streaming jar. May be it is better to just say hadoop-streaming.jar instead of giving path.
(2) In DumpTypedBytes.java, in "if (args.length == 0)", before printUsage() call, printing an error message like "too few arguments to dumptb" would be useful.
(3) Would it be better to say in printUsage() in HadoopStreaming.java as "[streamjob]" to signify that streamjob option is optional ?
(4) Description of options/arguments is missing in printUsage() in LoadTypedBytes and DumpTypedBytes. You can give the same description provided printUsage() of HadoopStreaming.java. For dumptb, should we say that the input can be either text file or sequence file ?

Will let you know offline some very minor nits., Patch incorporates review comments.
, Ran test-patch and ant test on my machine. All tests passed except the known failures (MAPREDUCE-1834 and MAPREDUCE-1925), Patch looks good.
