[As Ramya mentioned offline to me, this happens only in a narrow window when jobqueue_details.jsp is accessed after JT is started and before scheduler gets started and is not visible afterwards.

This doesn't have any side effects and can be easily fixed by a null check for jobQueuesManager in CapacityTaskScheduler.getJobs(String queue)., Attaching the screenshot, eventhough i have a null check on the  jobqueue manager, the same error is getting reported and the scheduler fails to start. ]
