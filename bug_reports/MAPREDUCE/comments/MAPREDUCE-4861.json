This message is automatically generated., Daryn, the code has been copied to yarn.server.rm.security.DelegationTokenRenewer and the corresponding tests have been copied to rm.security.TestDelegationTokenRenewer (except one test - testing renewal after close()). Do you suggest I add the missing test before deleting these?

The copied code suffers from issues similar to MAPREDUCE-4860. However, I still think o.a.h.fs.DelegationTokenRenewer can be re-used here instead.

This message is automatically generated., Looks like I ran the wrong TestDelegationTokenRenewer locally before uploading. Taking a closer look, I don't think the new test applies to YARN as the Renewer can't be stopped and restarted. Shall upload the first patch again., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
