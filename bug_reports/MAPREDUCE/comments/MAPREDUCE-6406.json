There is a description mismatch with the default value in mapred-default.xml for the same configuration, can you correct the same as part of this patch?

{code:xml}
<property>
  <name>mapreduce.fileoutputcommitter.algorithm.version</name>
  <value>2</value>
  <description>The file output committer algorithm version
  valid algorithm version number: 1 or 2
  default to 1, which is the original algorithm
{code}
, - Update mapred-default.xml based on Devaraj's feedback, \\
