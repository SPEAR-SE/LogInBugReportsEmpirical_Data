[Unfortunately I can't seem to reproduce this running "ant javadoc" from my local build... anyone got any ideas?, Looks like same issue as MAPREDUCE-1947 (which is about test-patch), Aha, I see the issue. The doclet tag in build.xml refers to hadoop-common-${version} rather than hadoop-common-${hadoop-common.version}. So, on nightly, where the version includes a timestamp, it doesn't put the right common jar on the docletpath and fails., This patch fixes the issue for me (applies against both 22 and trunk), +1, seems reasonable., Committed to trunk and branch, will kick off another build. Thanks Arun, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #609 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/609/])
