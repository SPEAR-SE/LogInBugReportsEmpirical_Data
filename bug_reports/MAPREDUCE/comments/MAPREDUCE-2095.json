[Here's a patch that uses the existing capability of Rumen to read compressed traces., Compressed trace for a WordCount Job needed by the unit-test introduced by the patch for this ticket. This
needs to go into {{src/contrib/gridmix/src/test/data}} in the source-tree., An updated version of the patch, now includes a unit-test. This depends on the compressed WordCount
trace uploaded earlier (both need to be committed together)., The updated patch includes a unit-test that produces the following (snipped) results with "ant test":

{quote}, Reviewed the patch and over all it looks good. However, please make sure to add java doc information for test method before commit.
+1, Code changes look fine to me.

Some minor comments on the testcase:
(1) io.close() can be moved to finally block.
(2) Also, please delete the contents of rootTempDir in the finally block.
(3) Please add some javadoc to the testcase.
(4) Please include the data file wordcount.json.gz in the patch so that committer need not have to remember the path where it is to be committed., Updated version of the patch incorporating comments from Ravi and Vinay.

Even with {{diff --text}} the patch does not contain the binary data file. I will have to coordinate with
the committer to ensure that both the pieces are checked in., Changes look good to me.

Attaching patch merging with the gzipped data file. Patch is generated using "git diff --text --no-prefix HEAD"., I just committed this. Thanks Ranjit !, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
