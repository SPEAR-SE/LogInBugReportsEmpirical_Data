[I'm likely misunderstanding, but won't this prevent hadoop working on machines with only a loopback?  [I'm thinking primarily of single node clusters on laptops on an airplane.]  It would also be interesting to see how Solaris Zones would interpret this changes., Even I thought so, but when I verified it("http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/net/InetAddress.html#isAnyLocalAddress()"), I realized that this method checks if the InetAddress in a wildcard addresses only and not the loopback/localhost addresses. So I guess single node clusters will still work fine. Steve?, That's correct, loopback still works happily. All we need to check for is the {{isAnyLocalAddress()}}  value, and not {{isLoopbackAddress()}}, which is different. Something like (from a TT subclass that has this test and did find my error) :-

{code}
        if(jobTrackAddr.getAddress().isAnyLocalAddress()) {
            throw new IOException("Cannot start the Task Tracker as it has been started with "
            + "mapred.job.tracker set to icp://"+getJobTrackerAddress()+"/");
        }
{code}

Allen, if you fly with colleagues you could set up a WLAN and run work across everyone's machines, though someone needs to bring up a DNS server unless Hadoop works with Bonjour. Me, I stick to virtualized linux images with hand-edited {{/etc/hosts}} files, This is probably stale, especially with HARM.]
