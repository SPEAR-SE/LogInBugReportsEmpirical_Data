[ - When AM launches a container, NM will return a binary blob per service keyed by service-id. For MR shuffle case, it will return the shuffle service's port.
 - AM will get the address for the needed service-id and stores it in the TaskAttemptImpl so as to use it when it
creates the MapTaskCompletionEvents for the reduces (in TaskImpl).
 - I still need to investigate persisting to the task log a bit to know for sure how to handle this.
, bq. I still need to investigate persisting to the task log a bit to know for sure how to handle this.
AM restart is achieved through reading job-history logs. So we can store the shuffle address also there - that's the part of the code that you may want to look at.

We can definitely separate out the restart-related fixes into another JIRA issue, if that helps., Adding in a first patch for this issue.  I have manually verified that mapreduce.shuffle.port in mapred-site.xml is honored and workes, but I still need to update/add unit tests to verify more of the functionality.  I am posting the patch to get feedback on it sooner rather then later.

It is also lacking persisting and restoring the ports during restart.  That will probably be done on a different JIRA., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Proceeding with review after patching the patch. It mostly looks clean, great job, I have only a few comments:

TaskAttemptEvent.java
 - "This is only valid if the type of the event is TA_CONTAINER_LAUNCHED": This clearly seems to tell us (:)) that we need a subclass of TaskAttemptEvent - TaskAttemptContainerLaunchedEvent. We can put the shuffle-port as a payload of that event. Once you do that, the rest of the changes to TaskAttempt.java can be dropped.

TaskAttemptImpl.java
 - TODO in  public TaskAttemptReport getReport(): We don't need it here, instead we need this information in TaskCompletionEvents returned to client. Can you get this returned via {{MRClientService.getTaskCompletionEvents()}}?

ContainersLauncherImpl:
 - We should probably not have the default value to be 8080 here, if the response to ContainerLaunch doesn't have the port, we should fail the task then and there itself.

Integration test:
 - To test this patch's integration, you should probably just set this port to a non-default value say 8081 in TestMRJobs before starting MiniMRYarnCluster. Either that or change MiniMRYarnCluster itself.

General: Please wrap around lines longer than 80 characters., @Vinod

I think I have the new patch ready, I just want to clarify a few things before going forward with it.

I added in the subclass but I am not sure what changes to TaskAttempt.java can be dropped.  Did you mean the other changes to TaskAttemptEvent.java can be dropped?


The TODO should have been deleted a while ago.  It was there before I understood the code, and I was just marking where similar data was being used.  Do you think I need to add something to the TaskCompletion events returned to the client?, bq. I added in the subclass but I am not sure what changes to TaskAttempt.java can be dropped.

Sorry, my mistake, I meant "TaskAttemptEvent.java" will no longer need any changes.

bq. The TODO should have been deleted a while ago. It was there before I understood the code, and I was just marking where similar data was being used. Do you think I need to add something to the TaskCompletion events returned to the client?
I just checked, you changes automatically return correct MapOutputServerAddress to the clients also. Nothing to do here., Great.  I will have the patch uploaded very soon.  By changing the TaskAttemptEvent to a different class it exposed that I had not handled the start container event consistently everywhere it was sent.  I missed app master recovery, local mode, and MRApp test mode.  So I have updated them all.

Also the unit test changes you wanted are more stubbed out then I expected.  MRApp uses a MockContainerLauncher, which does not really launch anything.  It does not talk to the TaskTracker so setting the config value will not really test anything I changed.  I reverted my change to the test because of that.  I have tested it manually and I can see how it would be nice to have a unit test to verify that, but that would require some deep changes to MRApp to make that work., This patch addresses Vinod's comments., bq.

Excellent! That did help after all :)

I actually mentioned TestMRJobs or MiniMRYarnCluster in my comment. So you could set the port number to 8081/8082 in MiniMRYarnCluster where shuffle server itself is set (MiniMRYarnCluster.java +75). That should be enough - TestMRJobs, TestMRJobsWithHistoryService etc will automatically test your code.

Updating patch with very minor changes, hope that's fine.
 - Modified MiniMRYarnCluster to start shuffle on 8083 (non-default value).
 - Replaced 8080 with a constant DEFAULT_SHUFFLE_PORT and renamed SHUFFLE_PORT to be SHUFFLE_PORT_CONFIG_KEY
 - Fixed a few log messages and wrapped around a couple of lines longer than 80 chars.
