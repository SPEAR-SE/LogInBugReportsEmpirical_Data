[In this screen shots, this is single node cluster 8 GB total memory. The default queue capacity is 20% which would be 1638MB allocated to it.  You will see that its currently using 2G so the usage is 125% - which is the utilization., screenshot after changing usedCapacity to be defined as utilization was. This is similar to how 0.20.X or 1.0 has used capacity defined., after thinking about this more. I changed the bar graphs to use the absolute capacities rather then the relative capacity/max capacity. The reason is that max capacity is not relative to capacity so having the graph show up properly when used capacity > capacity when max capacity configured to be > capacity is not possible in a fashion that shows up both capacity and max capacity properly.  

Another issue with using the relative ones is if max capacity is < capacity:
root queue = 100%
root.test: cap = 20%, max capacity = 100%, absolute cap = 20%, absolute max = 100%
root.test.a1: cap = 80%, max capacity = 20%, absolute cap = 16%, absolute max = 20%

The above should be a valid config but the graph would totally be messed up if displaying capacity 80% and max capacity 20%.

I also changed used capacity to be what utilization was defined as. I think this will make more sense to the user and matches what was in 0.20.X/1.0.  I removed utilization and added an absolute used capacity that can be used by the bar graphs. 

While I was in there I also changed it so that instead of opening all the divs and then closing the leaf queue ones, now everything starts closed and we only open the parent queues.  , screen shot with it using absolute capacities
, fix web services documentation.  Note this patch also fixes a bug where you can't configured max capacity < capacity., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch looks pretty good.  Some comments:

* CSQueueUtils.java seems to have been reformatted, which adds a lot of diffs to the patch that aren't necessary
* In CSQueueUtils.checkAbsoluteCapacities(), do we need to worry about floating point precision when comparing absMaxCapacity with absCapacity?  Wondering if we need a tolerance there to handle floating point computation errors.
* Super-Nit: In ParentQueue.java and LeafQueue.java, we should add the @Override decorator to setUsedCapacity() and setAbsoluteUsedCapacity(), Thanks for the review Jason, will upload patch with fixes shortly., changes from review comments., +1 (non-binding), looks good to me., +1 overall.
