[We store out the locations separately during submission anyway, so I guess this was done for saving the size of metadata written during submission. It has been this way since 0.18.

We can document it, but were you looking for location info from inside a record reader? How were you planning to use it?, My understanding is that FileSplit is not normally serialized -- internally, org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.split.JobSplit.SplitMetaInfo is used instead.

In my case I was writing FileSplits (actually, a subclass) to a file and then reloading it elsewhere in the code (a simple input format that just reads splits prepared by complex input selection code).  But I would say that is independent of this bug: either FileSplit should not be Writable, or it should implement serialization properly, or the reason and the fact of information loss should be clearly documented., Eh, never mind "not normally serialized", I just meant to say I realize that the hosts are handled correctly by SplitMetaInfo., Yeah we should document that the hosts won't be serialized. If anyone wishes to serialize hosts they'll have to extend and enhance the class to do so, or write their own complete implementation.

Would you like to contribute a doc fix for this?]
