[Simple patch., Zhihong, MR-4441 already addressed this, and has been committed to trunk and branch-2., Duplicate of MR-4441, The link to MAPREDUCE-4441 was added to MAPREDUCE-3451 just now, right ?
I didn't see it earlier., Hi Zhihong,

Yes. My mistake, I missed adding the link earlier and added only after seeing this JIRA. Sorry for the trouble. Thanks a lot for the patch, though. , Welcome.
I should paid more attention to my Inbox :-)]
