[This is a compiled eclipse-plugin for Hadoop 0.20.1. Tested on Eclipse 3.5 on Linux., Plugin has been working for me, but now all of a sudden I have no Hadoop options as if the plugin never existed and my HDFS connections are gone?
Plugin is still sitting in my eclipse_home...
When I look in the "Usage Data Collector --> Preview" I see a bunch of these errors: "Could not acquire children from extension: org.apache.hadoop.eclipse.views.dfscontent".
Any ideas how to fix this?, This is a patch that resolves the issue at both the build and runtime., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

* Since this is proposed for the 0.20 branch and Hudson (automated testing) will attempt to apply it to trunk, the {{test-patch}} target must be run manually. Directions are in the prenominate wiki, Hi Chris

I've removed the @author statement and have subsequently found the HowToContribute WikiPage, so I am in the process of testing it locally to confirm the patch will be accepted before I move this JIRA into Patch Available again., Moving to "Patch Available" - There is no supporting test as this resolves an issue with the build. The Build itself is the test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch causes the build to [fail|http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Mapreduce-Patch-h6.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/292/console], specifically:
{noformat}
     [exec] compile:
     [exec]      [echo] contrib: eclipse-plugin 
     [exec]     [javac] Compiling 45 source files to /grid/0/hudson/hudson-slave/workspace/Mapreduce-Patch-h6.grid.sp2.yahoo.net/trunk\
            /build/contrib/eclipse-plugin/classes

     [exec]     [javac] symbol  : class JavaApplicationLaunchShortcut
     [exec]     [javac] location: package org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.launchConfigurations
     [exec]     [javac] import org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.launchConfigurations.JavaApplicationLaunchShortcut;
{noformat}, This failure is a little weird as I get no such error when I run the apply-patch locally against the MapReduce project trunk. The only -1 I get is for lack of contrib tests, everything else is +1.

The only thing I can think of is the eclipse.home that Hudson is using is using a version of Eclipse older than 3.4. With Eclipse 3.4 and 3.5, the plugins folder contains org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui_3.3.1.v20080730_r341.jar which contains org.eclipse.jdt.debug.ui.launchConfigurations.JavaApplicationLaunchShortcut. 

If the file exists, it is specifically included  in the src/contrib/eclipse-plugin/build.xml script and should therefore work, as you can see below :

<project default="jar" name="eclipse-plugin">

  <import file="../build-contrib.xml"/>

  <path id="eclipse-sdk-jars">
    <fileset dir="${eclipse.home}/plugins/">
      <include name="org.eclipse.ui*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.jdt*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.core*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.equinox*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.debug*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.osgi*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.swt*.jar"/>
      <include name="org.eclipse.jface*.jar"/>

      <include name="org.eclipse.team.cvs.ssh2*.jar"/>
      <include name="com.jcraft.jsch*.jar"/>
    </fileset> 
  </path>
