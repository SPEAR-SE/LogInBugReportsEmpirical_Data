[Devaraj, Task Progress on the JobHistory UI will be fixed by MR2676 (removes progress). Looks like it works on the AM UI., Siddharth, It is working fine on the AM UI. In RM UI, it is showing as 0% for all applications., was referring to TaskProgress...  App progress is broken., Closing this as duplicate in favour of MAPREDUCE-3078 and MAPREDUCE-2676 which are fixing the issues separately.]
