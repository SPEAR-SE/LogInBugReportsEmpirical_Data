[@karam,
 Is speculative execution turned off with all the tests?, Yes Mahadev, this was without speculative execution.

I requested Karam to file this to look at any reduce-task side shutdown bug., We ran into this again, and it turns out this is a GridMix bug. The task code duly failed because of a datanode issues, but one of the threads in the GridMix's job - LoadJob.StatusReporter - is hanging., Making LoadJob.StatusReporter a daemon thread, as this was the thread that was hanging the JVM. Also, set ResourceUsageMatcherRunner to be a daemon thread, just in case.

Amar/Ravi, please see if this okay. Thanks!, Vinod,
Making Gridmix threads as daemon threads might not solve the root cause of this issue. Imagine user code spawning off non-daemon threads. I guess, the correct fix should force the task's jvm to exit once the task is done and ready to close. It should not matter what threads are running. Thoughts?  , Hitesh - can you please take a look since you are already working on related areas?

Currently the TT sends SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL..., This is blocking gridmix, any eta?, Patch basically changes how containers are killed. It now triggers a sigterm before a delayed sigkill. 

Tweaked the handling of getting the pid slightly so that it can still be obtained after the command completes. This does not really imply that we can actually get the pid but just implies we can get to the executor/process object which in turn may allow us to get the pid.

Requires some testing to see if this addresses the underlying issues. 

@Karam, could you give it a try?  , Okay, this patch is still not going to help. The main bug is that the task code is not reporting the AM that it got an exception. If the task had reported, AM would have known to go ahead with cleaning up this task.

We still need SIGTERM followed by SIGKILL to properly cleanup tasks, but that is not going to solve the current problem. I'll create a separate ticket for that., My earlier suspicion that a non-daemon thread created by user's code hanging the JVM also turned wrong. In that case, eventually the child heads for shutdown, kills the umbilical client which in turns makes Task's reporter thread to sys-exit with 65 exit-code after about 10 seconds.

Something else happened in this case - may be the DFSClient hung and caused the JVM to get stuck.

Attaching patch that should fix such cases. For non-daemon hanging threads, this will avoid the 10 seconds delay which I confirmed with the test., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Patch with respect to change in YarnChild looks good. Verified tests show the time elapsed change with the fix although would be preferable to have a test that errors out without this fix ( which may not be that trivial to implement )., Thanks for the review Hitesh. Yes I thought of having the test like that, but it is way too much effort. The discernible delay in the failure clearly validates it for me, will stick to that., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23., Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1135 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1135/])
