 Can you take a look at the failing test?

thanks, The failing test was indicating an underlying problem with the first patch: passing the Cluster object to the Job causes the configuration objects to get out of sync (which is what MAPREDUCE-1788 was addressing) so the YARNRunner (or LocalJobRunner) would use the configuration from the Cluster, which would not reflect any changes made to it during job submission (e.g. setting distributed cache properties). So instead this patch updates the Cluster object in the JobClient to be the one used for job submission.

All tests pass for me now., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
