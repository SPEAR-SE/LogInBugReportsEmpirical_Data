[Through experimentation, only two different test method orders were shown to succeed.
|testFormatWithCustomSeparator|
|testCompress|
|testFormat|

|testFormat|
|testFormatWithCustomSeparator|
|testCompress|

All other orders produced failures. Thus the inter-dependency is that _testCompress_ must be run *immediately after* _testFormatWithCustomSeparator_.

*Dependencies Identified*
* All tests verify success by reading input from the same test file test.txt
* _testCompress_ relies on having the same custom separator as _testFormatWithCustomSeparator_
* _testCompress_ actually writes a file name test.txt.deflate, Thanks Jon. Minor nits: 
- in testCompress(), you didn't have to remove separator. I'd rather check \u0001 than \t.
- {code} output += out + "\n"; {code}
- Do you think we should clean up the output files in an @After ? Or do you think its more useful to have them around after the test for debugging? I could go either way.

bq. in testCompress(), you didn't have to remove separator. I'd rather check \u0001 than \t.
It's true that removing the separator wasn't technically part of this JIRA, but I chose to take it out since the custom separator test was already testing that.

That sounds reasonable. Ok. Lets just go with the first patch. It looks good to me. +1. Thanks for it. Please check it in.
