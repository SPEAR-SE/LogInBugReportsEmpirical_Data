[I discovered this while testing on Windows, where file locking is enforced more strictly.  The DistCp tests would fail sporadically due to not being able to delete the temp files.  I have a patch in progress., Here is a patch with the following changes:

# {{RetriableFileCopyCommand}} - This is just code clean-up.  The {{copyBytes}} private method accepted a flag as an argument to control whether or not to close the streams after copying.  This method was only ever called from {{copyToTmpFile}} with a hard-coded true.  I removed the flag from the method signature and changed the code so that it closes the streams unconditionally.
# {{ThrottledInputStream}} - Override {{close}} so that it closes the wrapped stream.
# {{TestIntegration}} - This code was not creating the target file correctly.  {{target}} contains a fully qualified path.  Inside {{createFiles}}, it prepends the test root again.  This would be 2 fully qualified paths appended to each other.  On Windows, the result would look like C:\project\target\C:\project\target.  The second ':' makes the filename invalid.

With this patch, all DistCp tests pass consistently on Mac and Windows.
