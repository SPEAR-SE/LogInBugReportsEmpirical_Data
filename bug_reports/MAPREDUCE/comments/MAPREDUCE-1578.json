This message is automatically generated., +1 the patch looks good. I have been thinking about moving out HarFileSystem to mapreduce and get it into contrib or some seperate tools jar so that its not part of the core release. We might want to do that ASAP. We can commit this for now, but moving it out of core is very essential for folks to use Har!, I have committed this.
