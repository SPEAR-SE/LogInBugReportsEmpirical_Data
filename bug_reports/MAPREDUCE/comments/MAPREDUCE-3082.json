This message is automatically generated., The patch applies to hadoop tools directory and not to the mapreduce directory and it seems like that is the reason the patch cannot be applied cleanly. Wondering if I should create a new JIRA under common for this to work?, Is there a reason that you are doing

{code}
if (!parentPath.isAbsolute()) {
    parentPath= new Path(parentPath.getFileSystem(getConf()).getWorkingDirectory(), args[i+1]);
}
{code}

instead of


{code}
if (!parentPath.isAbsolute()) {
    parentPath= parentPath.getFileSystem(getConf()).makeQualified(parentPath);
}
{code}
, Bobby,

This message is automatically generated., I am getting test failures on that test now.  Perhaps you can run it again and see if you can determine what is happening., If the unit tests are run from hadoop-tools, they do fail, however, that used to be the case even before this change. I thought there was a JIRA to address that issue, but could not find it. If the unit tests are run from base directory, it passes., OK You are correct about that.  I ran it from the base and it looks good.  Thanks +1, Thanks John,  I put this into trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2067 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2067/])
