This message is automatically generated., [~zhaoyunjiong] The patch looks good. Can you post a patch against trunk for QA to be able to apply it. Also, I was wondering if it would be possible to add a test?, No need for trunk. In hadoop 2.0, the problem doesn't exist.
It's very difficult to test a thread safe problem, even it's not thread safe, in most case it will pass it., My bad - read the branch name wrong. I applied the patch locally, and verified that the tests that directly use {{DefaultTaskController}} pass - TestTaskTrackerLocalization, TestJvmManager, TestTaskEnvironment.

+1, Uploading the patch from MAPREDUCE-4964 as that solves this issue in a simpler/cleaner way. The discussion on that JIRA has all the details.

Applied the patch to latest branch-1 and it applies cleanly. Also, verified TestJobLocalizer passes., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1. As per discussion in MAPREDUCE-4964 the latest patch seems a better way of doing it., Thanks Karthik. Committed to branch-1. Arun, thanks for double checking on this one., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
