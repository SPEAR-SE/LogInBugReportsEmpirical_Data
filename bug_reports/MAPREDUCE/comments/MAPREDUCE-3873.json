[*HostsFileReader#readFileToSet* reading entries from the file and adding those entries to set. This entry can be either an *IP Address* or a *hostname*. However while validating a hostname,checking whether the hostname is part of set of entries excluded. So just comparing *hostname* with *IP address*, which returns false. 

I think, while adding entries to set in *HostsFileReader#readFileToSet*, we should add the hostname of the entry, rather than just adding it., I observed the same, but this is minor., same is observed for "yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.include-path" configuration., The patch will support that we config either hostname or ip in the "yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.exclude-path" and yarn.resourcemanager.nodes.include-path file., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The modified function:
  public boolean isValidNode(String hostName) {
    synchronized (hostsReader) {
      Set<String> hostsList = hostsReader.getHosts();
      Set<String> excludeList = hostsReader.getExcludedHosts();

      String ip = NetUtils.normalizeHostName(hostName);

and the function NetUtils.normalizeHostName(hostName) can not be mocked.
So, I think this patch do not need provide the unit testcase., Patch looks good. +1.

It is easy to write a test, I already have one. Let me upload the patch with a test case., Patch with tests. Tests fail without the fix and pass with.

  Thanks for your testCase. TestResourceTrackerService is very good. At the beginning, I only focus on the NodesListManager:isValidNode function., Vinod and Xiequiming,
