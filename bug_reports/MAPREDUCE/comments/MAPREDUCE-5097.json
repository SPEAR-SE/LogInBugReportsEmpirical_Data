[Attached tiny patch (MAPREDUCE-5097.patch).

Also tried to show the test case scenario that fails without the patch (MAPREDUCE-5097-ugly-test.patch). It is ugly: it actually just shows that when job classes are not in classpath then adding the jar using addArchiveToClassPath has no effect. The test should be better. I will try to figure one out when I have more time.. if this is really needed: the fix is pretty simple (if I got it right)., oh, and to try test you need to build examples jar after applying patch, so that you have jar to test on. It is ugly, I know :( and is not meant for committing. Only the patch with the fix (unless I add good test)., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
