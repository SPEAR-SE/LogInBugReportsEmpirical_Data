[The Eclipse-plugin provides functionality that allows users to navigate and interact (put/get) with the HDFS as well as write and run Map/Reduce jobs on Hadoop Clusters. With that said, I feel that the Common Project is a more suitable home for the component. Whatever is decided, the code and the JIRA component need to belong to the same component, otherwise people are going to get confused (as I was)., I moved all the open issues to the MAPREDUCE project, given its dependencies.]
