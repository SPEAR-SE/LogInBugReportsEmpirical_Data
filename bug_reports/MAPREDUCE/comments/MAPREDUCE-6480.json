[The patch takes care of #1 by refactoring a bunch of code to seed the list from the aggregated log files and filter out any that haven't finished aggregating according to the RM.

We can do #2 in a followup YARN JIRA., \\

This message was automatically generated., One of the checkstyle warnings is that {{finishTime}} hides a field here:
{code:java}
public void setFinishTime(long finishTime) {
  this.finishTime = finishTime;
}
{code}
but this is pretty standard practice for a setter, isn't it?, [~rkanter] the overall approach looks good. 
Some questions and comments.

Re checkAggregatedStatus and various LogAggregationStatus states
1. a. Looks like TIMED_OUT state will be considered eligible for logaggregation. That seems the right thing to do
1. b. Similarly FAILED is not considered for log aggregation while earlier it was, right? Should it also be considered for aggregation? Looking at the description it indicates some log has error in aggreation. Are we not considering it because it may cause some logs to be left behind? If thats the reason I am ok with the current patch approach. Just want to confirm.

2.  If a new non terminal LogAggregationStatus gets added to the enum we will not filter it out in checkAggregatedStatus. Is that a problem that we accidentally process it? If so we should extract a function and add a unit test case to catch those newly added states and explicitly fail the unit test.

3. consider reversing the conditions for the user != null in AppInfo#equals to make it easier to read
{noformat}
return user != null ? user.equals(appInfo.user) : appInfo.user == null;
{noformat}

4. consider adding log lines when we skip an application because the maxTotalSize is exceeded and also when we get an IOException. 
5. FileWriter import is now unused
6. consider seedAndCheckFiles -> checkFilesAndSeedApps
7. consider checkAggregatedStatus -> filterAppsByAggregatedStatus

8. In seedAndCheckFiles we have a catch for the outer iteration. This could potentially break out of the loop on first app with an error and not process any more apps for that user. Should it instead be like the old way where we wrap the innermost
{noformat} FileStatus[] files = fs.listStatus(appLogPath); {noformat}
That will also match the comment {noformat} // Ignore any apps we can't read {noformat}

TestHadoopArchiveLogs
8. Consider extracting out System.getProperty("user.name") into a variable to avoid repeated calls

nits:
9. Formatting inconsistency in in the findbugs exclude
, 003 patch addresses Anubhav's comments:

1. Ya.  For FAILED, we don't know why, so I figured it was safest to just not do anything to the logs.  For TIMED_OUT, it seemed like the idea is that nothing bad happened, but we're not expecting any more logs.

2. Done

3. This was generated by IntelliJ.  I'd rather leave it in as-is to be safe.

4. I've added a {{-verbose}} option, which prints out a lot more details about what's happening.

5. Done

6. Done

7. Done

8. I think we should do both.  You're right that we could break out if there's an error with just one app.  At the same time, if the user running the tool doesn't have permission to access the logs for a specific user, we don't want to keep trying over and over again.

8 (#2). Done

9. Done, \\
