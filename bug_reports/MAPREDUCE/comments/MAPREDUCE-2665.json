This message is automatically generated., I am a bit confused by the changes, and it might just be me so if you could clarify a few things I would appreciate it.

Doesn't NetUtils.getHostname() just return the name of the host we currently are on, and doesn't WebApp.getPort() just return the port number that the web app is listening on and we currently are to thorough the web browser?  If so why are these changes needed at all because I am already connected to that box on that port.  I can just grab it from the browser address bar?  Unless of course this is actually going through a proxy of some sort., Having the hostname anad port is redundant information in the normal use case since this can be found in the browser
address bar. Closing this ticket as wont fix to document the reason.]
