[Patch is available. Will upload for review soon., Since this page is controlled by the MRAppMaster and not YARN, moving this to the MAPREDUCE project., When creating patch, realized that there's a similar fix is already in. Marked this as dup.

My fix was to add a closing block: " ._()". which is similar to Thomas's addition of " .tbody()".
