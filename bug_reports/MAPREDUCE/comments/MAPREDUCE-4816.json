[Hi Jason, I looked into this issue. The cause of the exception is that when a job is at a FAILED state, it should ignore further JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED events. While in the version 0.23.5, the trasition from FAILED state with JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED event is not declared in its state machine and thus throws the exception.

Actually, besides JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED, other events such as JOB_TASK_COMPLETED, JOB_MAP_TASK_RESCHEDULED also possibly to happen at the FAILED state and should also be declared in the state machine. 

I checked the trunk version.  And there seems to be some refactor done with the JobState -> JobStateInternal and already fix the transition problem mentioned above.

If necessary, I would back port the trasition fixes to these versions such as 2.0.2-alpha.
