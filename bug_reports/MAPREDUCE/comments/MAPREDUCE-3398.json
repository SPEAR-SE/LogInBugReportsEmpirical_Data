[Some options to fix this.
1. Change the NM and RM interaction - to have the RM wait for all NMs to notify the RM about contianer / app completion (or timeout). This would pretty much be a reversal of the current mechanism where the RM is responsible for app completion. Would be risky - the RM should not have to wait for NMs.
2. Have the NMs run as a proxy user - has a lot of operational issues, and possibly security concerns.
3. Aggregate logs as the NM user - this breaks the CLI.
4. The NMs asks for application token renewal while log aggregation is still to complete. This seems like the best option. Credit to Vinod for suggesting it., +1 for (4) ;), If security and log aggregation are enabled, the NM will send out an app keep alive request when a token is about to expire.
The RM takes care of the first keep-alive.
If the RM does not get a keep-alive request within the keep-alive timeout, the token will be cancelled.

Tested on a secure cluster - to check for logs being aggregated and token renewal requests from the NM., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

 How does the NM know which application to add to ask RM to keep alive? How does the NM detect applications that are about to expire the tokens?

Can you point me to the code in the patch?, The NM adds apps to the keep-alive list when it gets a FINISH_APPLICATION from the resource manager (Around line 452 of the patch - in {{NodeStatusUpdaterImpl}}). It uses the configured token-renewal timeout set via configuration - the same value that is used by the RM. Token renewal should only be happening if security and log-aggregation are enabled., assertTrue("Renewal of canceled token didn't fail", false);
  - could be replaced with a fail()

spelling mistake - DelayedTokenCacneller

Should we document that renewal/keep-alive time should always be 2x of node heartbeat time? 

Apart from the above minor nits, patch looks good.

 The patch looks good. One minor nit, can you please add the config option in yarn-default.xml and add a description to it? Also, do you have an open jira to document the whole logging story? Accessing user logs and admin help for configuring them would be an important thing to document., Few comments on the patch.

NodeStatusPBImpl.setKeepAliveApplications(): clears containerStatuses? (!)

I guess we can knock off YarnConfiguration.RM_DELEGATION_TOKEN_KEEPALIVE_TIME_MS altogether to instead use the NM-expiry interval itself. This configuration anyways needs to capped by the expiry interval. We may need it only if we ever want to lessen the keep-alive, but with the token-expiry usually in the range of 24 hours, we will hardly ever need to lessen it.

After doing the above, we can drop the documentation changes too. removal-interval-ms doesn't need to be documented.

NodeStatusUpdaterImpl:
 - createKeepAliveApplicationList(): The two loops can be rolled into one, a single loop iterating over appTokenKeepAliveMap?

DelegationTokenRenewer:
 - May I suggesting renaming DelegationTokenRenewer.removeApplication() to applicationFinished() and removeApplicationInternal() to removeApplicationFromRenewal()?, Updated patch based on review comments., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
