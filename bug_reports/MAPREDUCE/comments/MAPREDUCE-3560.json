[Sid, can you please take a look? Thanks!, I ran into this and took a quick look.  The test is failing because the test created an RM context without a delegation token renewer but RMNodeImpl assumes the context will always have one in StatusUpdateWhenHealthyTransition().  Looks like we either need to avoid using it there if it's null or mock up a DelegationTokenRenewer when setting up the test., Patch mocks the DelegationTokenRenewer in the failing test., +1 lgtm.  Patch is exactly how I tried fixing it locally., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
