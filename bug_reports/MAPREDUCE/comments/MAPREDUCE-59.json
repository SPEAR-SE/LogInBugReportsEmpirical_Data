[we'd need JobTracker.killJob() to return something other than void() in such a situation, or throw a subclass of IOException. 

Having the client look for the job and failing if it is not there would leave open a race condition., We already currently print:

{{Could not find job <JOB ID>}}

If the provided Job ID does not exist.

Resolving as 'Invalid'.]
