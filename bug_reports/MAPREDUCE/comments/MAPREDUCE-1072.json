[Since there may be incentive to keep EventWriter package private, it would make sense to move the VERSION to a specific Version object., If we intend to support the jobhistory format as a public format, then I think what's more critical than making this constant public is to fully document the format, and, in that document, declare the stability of this format.  This is not an API issue, but a data format issue, to permit independent implementations.  Or am I missing your point?, +1 on the thought. We are investing in a whole tool chain based on JobHistory, and we want to make sure the format is public stable. 

This jira tries to address a related but slightly different issue where we want to expose those public stable parts of the format as Java elements. Calling such things out would make developers conscious that these are part of public contract (eg marking the Version class "public, stable")., > eg marking the Version class "public, stable"

We might actually go with "public evolving" for a release first, to make sure we've got things right., bq. We might actually go with "public evolving" for a release first, to make sure we've got things right.
