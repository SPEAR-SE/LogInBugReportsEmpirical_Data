This message is automatically generated., Even the command line "queue -list" returns empty, we should fix "getRootQueues()" too.

Regarding the solution, it seems wrong that we are adding root queue also to the list. For better or worse, CapacityScheduler introduced the concept of a root queue which is *hidden* from users. With the patch, we are now exposing the root queue to the users. Instead if we change FifoScheduler to also have root->default queue hierarchy, this will be automatically solved, what do you think? Granted, we will need to fix some tests..]
