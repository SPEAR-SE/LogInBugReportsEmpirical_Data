This message is automatically generated., I believe the javadoc warnings are from HADOOP-8887 which added @goal and @phase tags that are generating warnings during javadoc generation., The javadoc warnings are because there are -4 of them, that means there are 4 less then the script expected :)  Someone fixed some and did not update it., Still reviewing but one request would be to extend TestFetchFailure to: make sure the tasks it returns are truly map tasks and then change to job.getMapAttemptCompletionEvents(0, 3) so that it makes sure the reducer is not included., Thanks for the review, Tom.  Updated the test case., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks good overall. Tests too. Minor nit: Two unused imports in TaskAttempListenerImpl after your patch, can remove them., Thanks for the review, Vinod.
