This message is automatically generated., Patch is for MR-279 branch, +1 the patch looks fairly simple and straight forward even without tests, but it would be nice to have a unit test or two to verify that it works., Jeffrey, the patch looks good.

I think this is an appropriate time to remove the copy of SleepJob in mrv2, it's always bugged me.

Also, will the same patch apply to trunk - can you pls check? Else, I can wait for the merge and just commit to trunk. Thoughts? Thanks., Bobby Evans is actually currently working on removing the extra SleepJob - I believe there are some issues that need to be resolved there (in a separate Jira).

As far as trunk, it does look like it has the same issue, so I'll post a patch for that as well., As requested, here is a patch for trunk (which only applies to the one SleepJob.java file), I just committed this to both trunk and MR-279. Thanks Jeffrey!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #766 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/766/])
