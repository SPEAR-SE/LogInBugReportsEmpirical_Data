[This performance problem prevents the AM from reliably supporting very large jobs (i.e.: tens of thousands of maps and thousands of reducers) because it can take too long to serve up requests and other clients end up being ignored and timeout.  If the same task times out enough attempts then the whole job fails., Sample stacktrace from one of the many IPC server threads waiting for a lock during type-conversion of the map completion events:

{noformat}, Attaching a patch that works around the problem by caching the type conversion of the map completion event.

It's a bit messy since previously we relied on the fact that updating the task completion event during a fetch failure implicitly updated map completion event since they were the same object.  When it's cached separately, we need a way to quickly lookup the cached map event from the task event so it can be updated as well.

Manually tested this on a large cluster, and it seems to make things better wrt. a thundering herd of reducers trying to connect.

A cleaner fix would be to convert TaskUmbilicalProtocol to use TaskAttemptCompletionEvents directly so we don't need to convert them at all except when honoring the org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.Job.getTaskAttemptCompletionEvents interface which is unlikely to be called in a performance-critical scenario.

There's also the performance issue of the locking within the PBImpl classes, but that's an issue probably best left to another JIRA., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The change looks good to me. Jason, could you please post a patch for branch-0.23 as well.

Agreed. TaskUmbilical using TaskAttemptCompletionEvents seems like a longer term change - the conversions ends up getting pushed to individual tasks, unless Task itself is change to work with mrv2 constructs., Thanks for the review, Sidd.

The javadoc warning is unrelated.  I ran the unit tests in hadoop-mapreduce-client-app and hadoop-mapreduce-client-hs and they all passed.  I also started up a pseudo-distributed cluster and ran wordcount and terasort jobs successfully., +1. Looks good. Committing this., Committed to trunk, branch-2 and branch-0.23.
