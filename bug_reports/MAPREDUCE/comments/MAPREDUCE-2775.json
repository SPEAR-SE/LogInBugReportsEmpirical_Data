[Instead of throwing the IOException, sending the decommisioned signal which will shutdown the Nodemanager.

Additionally one more problem has been addressed in this patch, when some exception occurs in communication with resourcemanager,
the StatusUpdater thread in the NodeStatusUpdaterImpl will get exited and not started again, in this case nodemanager will not send the heartbeat., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Reviewing the patch, have some comments.,  - We can consolidate Reboot and Decommission into a single enum say RMCommand.
 - Instead of making NM static and calling shutDown, you can use {{ServiceStateChangeListener}} interfacer to register NodeManager as the listener for state-changes of {{NodeStatusUpdater}}
 - In the same way, when {{NodeStatusUpdater}} encounters an exception, it can shut itself down, thereby bringing down the NM also.
 - Regarding the tests, I'd be happy if we have a more integrated test. Here's what I think is really useful. Start the existing MockRM object with AdminService started, create and rewrite the host-file in the test, decommission a node via refreshNodes() and then validate that the node is decomissioned?
 - Also, we can add one more test to verify that the Node indeed goes down when it gets the Decommission command from RM. Start a NodeManager, mock the heartbeat and send a Decommission command and verify that the NM stops.

I also want to make sure the test-suite is complete and 'd like to test the decommissioning feature on my single node setup. 'Coz we've never tested this ever, end to end in YARN - checking that containers are killed, NM is down properly, RM UI is updated with the decommissioned node count etc.

In the mean while, please see if you can add tests for one/more of the above. Thanks again!, Cancelling patch while Vinod's comments are addressed., Thanks for the comments Vinod.

# The NM should stop for 'REBOOT' also, this will solve MAPREDUCE-3034 for now., Updated patch with my comments.

This message is automatically generated., This needs a little bit more of effort: Hopefully the final set of comments:
 - Shall we rename {{NodeAction.DECOMMISSION}} to {{SHUTDOWN}}}?
 - Need to send a {{SHUTDOWN}} command to the nodes even if it is invalid at the RM at the time of registration. This is a very common case, we exclude the node even before we start the cluster.
 - Please also add a test for the above.
 - If the node is not valid, the correct component to send a {{RMNodeEventType.DECOMMISSION}} event to {{RMNode}} is {{NodeListManager}}. We can move this code out of {{ResourceTrackerService}} into {{NodeListManager.refreshNodes()}} - sending events to all nodes that get decomissioned during {{refreshNodes()}}. This will also ensure that the decomissioned-node-count gets incremented immediately instead of waiting for all the nodes to reach RM. Your tests in {{TestResourceTrackerService}} also simplify a bit.
 - {{TestNodeStatusUpdater}}: The two second sleeps are error prone. I think it should simply wait till heartBeatID becomes more than 3 or a timeout
 - Similarly in {{TestNMExpiry}}, you should spin around till lost-nodes' count becomes two or a timeout happens.
 - {{TestResourceTrackerService}} is good work!
   -- {{checkDecommissionedNMCount()}}: Again spin till the correct count or a timeout occurs., bq. If the node is not valid, the correct component to send a RMNodeEventType.DECOMMISSION event to RMNode is NodeListManager. We can move this code out of ResourceTrackerService into NodeListManager.refreshNodes() - sending events to all nodes that get decomissioned during refreshNodes(). This will also ensure that the decomissioned-node-count gets incremented immediately instead of waiting for all the nodes to reach RM. Your tests in TestResourceTrackerService also simplify a bit.

That seems like an involved change... the current fix is simpler? i.e. check each h/b and send it to the NM only when it sends a h/b ?

+1, please fix this. Thread.sleep is usually indicative of something wrong., Hi Vinod and Arun, Thanks for the comments,

{quote}
Shall we rename NodeAction.DECOMMISSION to SHUTDOWN}?{quote}

This would be a good idea. We can generalize it.

{quote}
Need to send a SHUTDOWN command to the nodes even if it is invalid at the RM at the time of registration. This is a very common case, we exclude the node even before we start the cluster.
Please also add a test for the above.{quote}
It is already shutting down if it is excluded node by throwing IOException. This can be done by sending the shutdown command as part of RegisterNodeManagerResponse instead of IOException.

I agree with Aruns comments on this, and in this case, we either need to establish a new communication between RM and NM other than heartbeat for generating events.

Yes, I will address this problem., I have updated the patch as per the above comments. Please review this., Devaraj, the patch looks good. But you seemed to have missed some files (ClusterMetrics.java) etc.

Also, please move NodeAction to yarn-server-common, it shouldn't be in yarn-api since it's internal. It should be in ./hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server/hadoop-yarn-server-common/src/main/proto/yarn_server_common_protos.proto

, I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Devaraj K!

Thanks for the patch-rebase, Arun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #97 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/97/])
    MAPREDUCE-2775. Fixed ResourceManager and NodeManager to force a decommissioned node to shutdown. Contributed by Devaraj K.
