[Sharad, I think you/Vinod were looking at this... can you please check? Thanks., This is due a bug in Job level node blacklisting. Indirectly it is related to how AM and RM keeps the request table. I will provide the fix shortly., Sharad - is this still valid? Thanks., Yes this bug is valid but only appears if job level node blacklisting is enabled.

sigh! I may not have the bandwidth to work on this in short term. feel free if someone else wants to take this up. thanks!, No worries, can you pls provide more info and I can get someone else to take this up? Thanks., I know the details, I was the one who originally ran into this while running YARN on a cluster :)

This message is automatically generated., Sorry, took time, it's an involved change. Mostly looks good. Few comments:

RMContainerRequestor:
 - Make the constructor with event-argument invoke the other constructor.
 - {{containerFailedOnHost()}}:
   -- Do we need to remove the rack entries from ask and remoteRequestTable also? (The TODO at the end)
   -- Use {{BuilderUtils.newResourceRequest()}} for constructing zeroedRequest.
 - {{getFilteredContainerRequest()}}: Why look for both IP addresses and host-names to check if they are/aren't blacklisted?

RMContainerAllocator:
 - Checks for illegal resource size (allocated.getResource().getMemory() < mapResourceReqt || maps.isEmpty()) can be moved one level up from so that we don't need to do multiple times in both _assign()_ and _getContainerReqToReplace()_?
 - Log message: "Could not find a valid request to which this allocated container maps to". Also add that this container is going to be released?

Test: It is not clear to me why we need five iterations in that loop, is it possible to make it deterministic or more explicit?

What about current running tasks, do we want to kill them too if we mark the node for blacklisting?

General: Wrap lines longer than 80 chars, only those which the patch touches of course :), bq. Do we need to remove the rack entries from ask and remoteRequestTable also? (The TODO at the end) 

I don't believe we should be blacklisting a rack based on a single node's failure. This probably needs a bit more thought in terms of how we decide to blacklist racks. Node failures could be co-related to rack/switch failures. I updated the comment with some more information on what we need to account for when blacklisting a rack and I will probably open a jira which we can use a discussion board on what approach should we apply when trying to blacklist a rack.

bq. getFilteredContainerRequest(): Why look for both IP addresses and host-names to check if they are/aren't blacklisted? 

Had added that as there was some confusion in the code in terms of handling hostnames and ips. Given that now containers are also using hostnames, all code in the allocator/requestor has now been changed to use hostnames only. 

bq. Test: It is not clear to me why we need five iterations in that loop, is it possible to make it deterministic or more explicit?

Was required as nodes blacklisted by AM could still be assigned back to it by the RM. Changed the code around a bit to mark the blacklisted nodes as not healthy and make the test more cleaner and deterministic.
