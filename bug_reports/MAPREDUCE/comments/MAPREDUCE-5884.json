[I tried to fix this general inconsistency in past.  The full principal should be used for validating token operations.  If one specifies a specific principal (ex. user/host@REALM), it shouldn't be expected behavior for "user" from anywhere to have privileges to the token.  The JHS should be fixed., Thanks Daryn for the confirmation.
