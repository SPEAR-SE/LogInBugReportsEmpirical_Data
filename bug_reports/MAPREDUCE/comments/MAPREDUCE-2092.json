[This is because HADOOP-6951 just got committed, but MAPREDUCE-2067 is not yet committed. I believe Tom White said that he'd be doing that (and HDFS-1399) soon, probably today.

Aaron, Please feel free to close this one then.
BTW, I have looked at MAPREDUCE-2067 and as a tiny suggestion: it makes sense to name patches with {{.patch}} suffix. Digital suffixes are especially painful, because they drive browsers crazy, normally., HADOOP-6951 has now been reverted and I confirmed MapReduce trunk now compiles. Sorry for the noise.]
