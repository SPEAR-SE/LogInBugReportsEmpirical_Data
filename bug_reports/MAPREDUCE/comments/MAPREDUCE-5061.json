[Maybe = is not a good idea for separator as that would break the backward compatibility, so a smart regexp seems to be more appropriate. , FileInputFormat.java contains 
  // This method escapes commas in the glob pattern of the given paths.
  private static String[] getPathStrings(String commaSeparatedPaths) {..}

we can  make that method public and possibly do following in the MultipleInputs.addInputPath(..)

for (String p : FileInputFormat.getPathStrings(path)) {
  //add the path p , it will not have commas
}, spoke too soon, FileInputFormat.getPathStrings(..) does not work if path contained braces., What do you guys think about an escape approach (e.g. "{a\,b}")?]
