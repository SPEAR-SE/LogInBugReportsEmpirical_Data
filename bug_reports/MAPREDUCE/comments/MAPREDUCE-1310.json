[Hive expects delimiter characters expressed as octal values to be exactly three digits, and do not require an additional '0' prefix character. As a result, octal strings such as {{'\01'}} generated by Sqoop do not get parsed correctly by Hive.

This patch adds a new test case file; committing this requires running:

{code}
svn add src/contrib/sqoop/src/test/org/apache/hadoop/sqoop/hive/TestTableDefWriter.java
{code}, Note that the method where octal values are parsed (tracing through the parsing of CREATE TABLE statements in Hive) is {{org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.parse.BaseSemanticAnalyzer.unescapeSQLString()}}., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failures are unrelated -- it looks like Hudson's classpath is broken., I've just committed this. Thanks Aaron!

bq. Test failures are unrelated - it looks like Hudson's classpath is broken. 

Subsequent patch builds on this machine have not had any NoClassDefFoundErrors, so I'm not sure if the problem is still there. , Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #197 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/197/])
