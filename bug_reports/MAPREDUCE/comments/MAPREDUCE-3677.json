["hadoop.security.authorization" is for secue RPC accessibility. I am not sure why you need to start nodemanager as root. But I did investigation based on Hadoop 0.23.10.
 I change hadoop/bin/yarn a little bit. I am using Java 1.7.0_45 and it reports illegal argument "-jvm".  I comment following lines in hadoop/bin/yarn:

  #if [[ $EUID -eq 0 ]]; then
   # YARN_OPTS="$YARN_OPTS -jvm server $YARN_NODEMANAGER_OPTS"
  #else
    YARN_OPTS="$YARN_OPTS -server $YARN_NODEMANAGER_OPTS"
  #fi
 
It works fine. Feel free to make any comments. If there is no response, I will close this JIRA in 3 days., Since there is no response for 3 days. I will close this issue. Reopen if necessary.]
