[Is this possibly that clock of JobTracker is not synchronized with that of DFS and differs by few hours?, So here is what might have happened. Consider the following sequence of events
||Time||Event||
|x|delete threads runs once|
|x + 20| job completes|
|x + 60 | delete thread runs and finds that job has completed 40 mins so ignores it|
|x + 120| delete thread runs and deletes the job status|

So from the time the job completed, its {{(x + 120) -  (x + 20) = 1hr 40mins}}. We should decrease the check interval. , Ah, beautiful!

But no matter how much we decrease the check interval, this situation is always bound to happen. I think it should be enough to simply document that jobs will be retained for any time between _mapred.job.tracker.persist.jobstatus.hours_ and _(mapred.job.tracker.persist.jobstatus.hours + THREAD_SLEEPT_TIME)_. Thoughts?, +1 on fixing the documentation., It would appear this documentation bug is also present in all the accompanying vendor documentation too.  Not sure we care now though.]
