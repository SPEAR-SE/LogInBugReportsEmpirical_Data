[We can move these to debug level under an if (LOG.isDebugEnabled()) check., Attaching patch by changing the log statements to debug level., +1., Ravi,
Can you please check JobTracker, JobInProgress and TaskInProgress for similar cases?, Checked JobTracker, JobInProgress and TaskInProgress. I don't see any other similar cases there., +1, When testing mumak, we also found that a few LOG.debug() statements include unnecessary string concatenation operations. This is probably a good place to fix those too. I will upload a updated patch shortly., Revision to my previous statement: 

When testing mumak, we found 24% of the cpu time is spent in string concatenation operations in the LOG.debug() statement in ResourceEstimator.getEstimatedTotalMapOutputSize(), Canceling patch to take care of Hong's new patch., +1 for Hong's patch.

This message is automatically generated., The -1 from tests is expected because this is only a change to log lines and hence no tests were included. I will commit this patch now.

It is surprising though that we are getting a +1 overall while tests failed. Clearly something to fix urgently. I will open a separate JIRA for that., bq.

HADOOP-6341., I committed this to trunk. Thanks, Ravi and Hong !, Attaching a patch for Hadoop 0.20. (Not for commit)., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #101 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/101/])
    . Reduce verbosity of log lines in some Map/Reduce classes to avoid filling up jobtracker logs on a busy cluster. Contributed by Ravi Gummadi and Hong Tang.
, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #127 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/127/])
    . Reduce verbosity of log lines in some Map/Reduce classes to avoid filling up jobtracker logs on a busy cluster. Contributed by Ravi Gummadi and Hong Tang.
, I agree that this does not need unit testing, because we are just changing the log level of the items, but we do need to test have tests for log entries when we can.  We rely on logging to help debug issues in the wild and need to have assurance that they are working correctly.  Thanks., Let's get this fixed in the 0.20 branch too please. :)]
