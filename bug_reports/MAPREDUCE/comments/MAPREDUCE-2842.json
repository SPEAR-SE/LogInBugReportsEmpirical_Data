[Alejandro - can you pls put forth a min. subset for step1 and then the rest? Tx, The proposal is that artifact/module names would be:

{code}
trunk/:
  mapreduce -> hadoop-mapreduce

trunk/hadoop-mapreduce/:
  mr-client -> hadoop-mr-client
  yarn -> hadoop-yarn

trunk/hadoop-mapreduce/hadoop-yarn:
  yarn-api -> hadoop-yarn-api
  yarn-common -> hadoop-yarn-common
  yarn-server -> hadoop-yarn-server

trunk/mapreduce/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-server:
  yarn-server-common -> hadoop-yarn-server-common
  yarn-server-nodemanager -> hadoop-yarn-server-nodemanager
  yarn-server-resourcemanager -> hadoop-yarn-server-resourcemanager
  yarn-server-tests -> hadoop-yarn-server-tests
{code}
, Stale or fixed. take your pick. still closing this.]
