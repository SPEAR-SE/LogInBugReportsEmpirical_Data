[I found this issue was broken by the behavior change of {{RawLocalFileSystem#mkdir}} introduced by HADOOP-11347. We should fix the test case., It looks like {{RawLocalFileSystem#umask}} is not initialized in the test, which cause the NPE. Maybe we should call {{fs.initialize(FsConstants.LOCAL_FS_URI, conf);}} instead of  {{fs.setConf(conf);}} so {{umask}} will be initialized., thanks [~zxu] for taking a look into this issue and thanks [~ajisakaa] for reporting..Attached the patch ..Kindly review.., \\
