This message is automatically generated., Looking at Job.getTaskCompletionEvents(int) in Hadoop 1, it delegates to JobClient.getTaskCompletionEvents(int) which caps the max number of event to 10. Unless I'm missing something we should be doing the same here, thus not only providing API compat but behavior compat., That's a good point; not sure why I didn't see that it was 10 before.  

New patch uses {{10}} instead of {{Integer.MAX_VALUE}}, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1. not very happy about the try/catch/rethrow-as-runtime for the interrupted-exception but I cannot think a better way of handling this as it is produced by the UGI.doAs() call in the getTaskCompletionEvents(int, int)., Thanks Robert.
