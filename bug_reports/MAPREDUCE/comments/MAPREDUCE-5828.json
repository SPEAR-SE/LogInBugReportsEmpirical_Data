[The problem is that testControlledJob() runs first but exits before the job finishes. The next test starts, tries to cleanup test output directories but fails on Windows because the earlier process is still alive. The second test now fails with an error that the output directory already exists.

Here's a simple patch that makes testControlledJob() wait till the job finishes. The test passes on JDK 7 + Windows after this patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
