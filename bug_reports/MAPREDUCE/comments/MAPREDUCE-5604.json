[I'm attaching a patch that applies the same fix we've used in similar cases: use the simple class name instead of the fullly qualified class name so that the testing directory is shorter., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12611259/MAPREDUCE-5604.1.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:green}+1 @author{color}.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    {color:green}+1 tests included{color}.  The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files.

    {color:red}-1 javac{color:red}.  The patch appears to cause the build to fail.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/4160//console

This message is automatically generated., +1. Change looks good to me., bq. -1 javac. The patch appears to cause the build to fail.

This is unrelated to the patch.  It looks like another problem with the Jenkins server being overloaded:

{code}
Error occurred during initialization of VM
Cannot create VM thread. Out of system resources.
{code}
, +1 patch looks good.

Since this only changes a test, the build failure is obviously unrelated., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4686 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4686/])
