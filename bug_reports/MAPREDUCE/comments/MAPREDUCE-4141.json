[need both this patch and HADOOP-8284 to address the issue, please commit both at the same time.

I've tested this out with a full build and clover test. It was able to generate clover output and view in a browser fine. Fixed the issue with pb changes (itself has code gen phase) by pushing clover into process-sources phase - which makes more sense anyway. I also tested generating the distro and it gen'd that fine as well (w/o including clover jar), -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
