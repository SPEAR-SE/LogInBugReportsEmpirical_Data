[Jason - can you please take a look at this asap? Thanks., Patch to call JvmMetrics.initSingleton() instead of JvmMetrics.create() to prevent multiple instantiations.  No additional unit tests since this is fixing existing tests., I manually ran the TestRMContainerAllocator tests, and they pass after applying the patch.  I also re-ran the metrics tests to verify the ResourceManager is still reporting JVM metrics.

Not sure why Jenkins didn't catch this failure back on MAPREDUCE-3964.  Apparently it doesn't run these tests?, The patch looks good to me.  I am rerunning all of the MR tests now, because for some reason Jenkins missed this test failure. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Test failures appear to be another occurrence of MAPREDUCE-3729 rather than a result of this patch.  I was unable to reproduce the problem locally.  All of the test failures are of the form:

{noformat}
chmod: cannot access `/tmp/hadoop-jenkins/mapred/staging/jenkins-1903973876/.staging/job_local_0001': No such file or directory
{noformat}, All of the mapreduce tests passed when I ran them manually +1, Thanks Arun for finding this bug.  Thaks Jason for the quick turn around on the patch.
