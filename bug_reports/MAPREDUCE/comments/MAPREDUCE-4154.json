[Example of streaming job that succeeds with 1.0.2 - 

sudo -u templeton hadoop fs -rmr /tmp/t.out; sudo -u templeton /usr/bin/hadoop jar /usr/lib/hadoop/contrib/streaming/hadoop-streaming-1.0.2.jar -input /tmp/nums.txt -output /tmp/t.out -mapper *'/bin/ls no_such-file-12e3'* -reducer /usr/bin/wc
, Patch for hadoop-1 line. Seems like the fix is already there in trunk via MAPREDUCE-3790.  Alternative is to backport the patch for MAPREDUCE-3790 into hadoop-1.. , The actual fix in the patch is the same as in MAPREDUCE-3790, just going to pull this one in.  

+1 thanks Devaraj!, committed this to branch-1., I think we should put this into 1.0.3. Thoughts?, bq. I think we should put this into 1.0.3. Thoughts?
+1, +1 on 1.0.3. I think this fixes other cases where the pipe shuts down before we've finished gathering the output from the reducer. , I just committed this back to 1.0.3 and moved the log in the branch-1/CHANGES.txt., +1.  Thanks, Owen and Devaraj., Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.0.3.]
