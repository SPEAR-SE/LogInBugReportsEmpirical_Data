[Which job scheduler are you using? The choice of tasks to preempt is entirely up to the scheduler, so you should mark the issue as belonging to the particular scheduler that you're using., Actually, looking at your email address, I have a good idea which scheduler you might be using :P. This is an issue that can be fixed through configuration, but you should talk to Joydeep about what the best way to deal with it is. If there is a change you want to make to preemption in trunk let me know though., Hi Adam,
Actually preemption does kill based on FairShare and minimal slots requirement. It doesn't kill tasks beyond your FairShare.
We can discuss this more.]
