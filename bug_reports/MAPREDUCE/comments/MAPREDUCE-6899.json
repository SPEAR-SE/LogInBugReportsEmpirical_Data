[The JobHistoryEventHandler is responsible for generating events for job history (i.e.: data needed by the job history server).  It is not control syslog.  The reason the logs aren't seen is because the MRAppMaster stop method does this:
{code}
  protected void shutdownTaskLog() {
    TaskLog.syncLogsShutdown(logSyncer);
  }

  @Override
  public void stop() {
    super.stop();
    shutdownTaskLog();
  }
{code}

and TaskLog.syncLogsShutdown calls LogManager.shutdown.  That stops all log4j log appenders, so any subsequent attempts to log will be ignored.]
