[Seems like the same problem is causing Apache HDFS build to fail [aspects compilation|http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/view/Hadoop/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/165/] :(

I'd suggest to move this to HADOOP instead of keeping it here., Anyone have any ideas on this? I thought it was something peculiar to the apache hudson, but I experienced the same thing on a local build machine - a bunch of tests failed in a row, then things revived for the rest of the test sequence., stale.]
