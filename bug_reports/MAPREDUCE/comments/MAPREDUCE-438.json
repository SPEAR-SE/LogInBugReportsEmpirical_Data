[Mixed usage of hostnames and IP addresses will cause problems even though the same namenode is being referenced. , This is likely still an issue.  I've fixed it on my 0.18.3 but not tried on anything more recent as I am locked into java 1.5.  Is anybody else besides me interested in fixing this?, I think it would be a very useful fix. Many times, the users that are affected by this don't know the actual cause.]
