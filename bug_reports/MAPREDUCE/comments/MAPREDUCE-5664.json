[Could you please provide sample xml files for processing as well as job configuration and relevant part of the MapReduce class so this could be reproduced? Also, please set the hadoop version in the Affects Version of the JIRA. This will greatly help someone reproduce this issue quickly., Looks like HADOOP-5254 and HADOOP-7462 has surfaced. Your classpath has an out of date XML parser on it, and this is being picked up in preference to the version of Xerces bundled with Java6 and Java7/

#1 as Jonathan says, can you specify which version of Hadoop this is arising on. If it is not Hadoop 1.2 or Hadoop 2.2, it's not going to be treated as a bug, as these contain what should be fixes for this problem.


HADOOP-5254 includes details on how to go about tracking the underlying issue, which is very much a configuration problem, You need to move up to a recent version of Hadoop: the fixes for your problem are already in the codebase. 

If you can't move up, look at HADOOP-5254 for one route as to how to go about identifying and working round the XML parser versioning issue *on your own machine*.
, Resolving as duplicate of HADOOP-5254 ; the issue here "using out of date XML parser" is handled in Hadoop 1.2+ . Upgrade Hadoop or configure the JVM to use the XML parser built in to java 1.6]
