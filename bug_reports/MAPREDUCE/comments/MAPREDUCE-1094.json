[+1 for the idea. But not sure if this is a blocker for 0.21. The sleep interval is still configurable, so if one wants faster initialization, the interval can be reduced., Maybe JobInitPoller can use wait(5s) instead of sleep(5s). When a JobInProgressListerner method invoked, notify JobInitPoller to avoid sleeping 5s if new jobs coming., Downgrading the priority for 0.21 as we have a reasonable workaround. Should be fixed for 0.22.]
