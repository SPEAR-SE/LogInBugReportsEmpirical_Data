[DNS.getDefaultHost() was return the host name of "localhost.localdomain" to TaskTrackerStatus.
And, http://localhost.localdomain:50030/machines.jsp is work on my local machine.

What is it all about? , I've seen this on linux boxes that don't know who they are, yet are on a semi-functional network with DNS.

an nslookup of the localhost.localdomain gets relayed to the DNS server, which then fails

>nslookup localhost.localdomain
Server:		192.168.1.1
Address:	192.168.1.1#53

** server can't find localhost.localdomain: NXDOMAIN

Presumably adding localhost.localdomain to /etc/hosts will make this problem go away -on that machine-. Where I've seen it on VMWare images, the machines were visible on the subnet -publishing an IPAddress would have worked., I have a newly built up Centos5.2 VM with minimal customisation -it defaults to a name locahost.localdomain

When deployed on a home network with no local DNS, just a relay to the outside world, it gets NXDOMAIN

in etc/hosts the entry is there

$ cat /etc/hosts
# Do not remove the following line, or various programs
# that require network functionality will fail.
127.0.0.1       localhost.localdomain   localhost
::1     localhost6.localdomain6 localhost6

nslookup fails, but operations like ssh localhost.localdomain do work. If the browser can't resolve http://localhost.localdomain:50060 then it may be set up to use a proxy, and the proxy is bailing out as there is no service on that system.

# it may be useful to have, as an option, the ability to use IPAddresses everywhere, rather than hostnames. 
# some diagnostics could add a requirement for non-local-host, fail if the hostname was just localhost/127.0.0.1
, The links have been fine for me since 0.20, when I began using Hadoop. Probably was resolved at some point.]
