[Seems very likely this is due to the recent commit of HDFS-2895., DFSClient, ClientProtocol etc. is is classified as private interface. The tests should be using FileSystem interface. We should create a bug to track this.

Vinod, can you please run a quick validation for this patch and commit it. I do not have my mapreduce env completely setup., +1. This looks good. I can confirm that the compilation passes with the patch and fails without.

Jenkins won't run these tests, but just submitting in case it catches any warnings. Will commit it post that., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12513493/MAPREDUCE-3818.txt
  against trunk revision .

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    +1 eclipse:eclipse.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    +1 findbugs.  The patch does not introduce any new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    +1 release audit.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    -1 core tests.  The patch failed these unit tests:
                  org.apache.hadoop.mapred.TestJobCounters

    +1 contrib tests.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/1796//console

This message is automatically generated., I suspect MAPREDUCE-3822 is tracking the same TestJobCounters issues.

In any case, the patch is fixing TestSubmitJob and should not affect TestJobCounters.

I am pushing this in., Just committed this to trunk. Will see if and when 0.23 needs it.

Thanks Suresh!, Integrated in Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit #1674 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Common-trunk-Commit/1674/])
