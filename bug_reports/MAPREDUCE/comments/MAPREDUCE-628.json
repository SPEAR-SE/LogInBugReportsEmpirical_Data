This message is automatically generated., Made this test as an unit test. 
This test creates data-local, rack-local and non-local maps and tests the internal data structures as the original test, but instead using the mock objects.
As a part of this test, also refactored the initTasks of FakeJobInProgress.initTasks to mimic initTasks of JobInProgress.
, Test Patch and all mapred tests passed with this patch, I just committed this. Thanks, Jothi!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #33 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/33/])
    . Improves the execution time of TestJobInProgress. Contributed by Jothi Padmanabhan.
, Modifes TestJobInProgress to use Fake Objects to test the functionality instead of running a full fledged job using the MiniMR clusters.]
