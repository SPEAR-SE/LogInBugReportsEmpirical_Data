[After turn on debug, got this in ApplicationMaster log:
DEBUG [IPC Server handler 0 on 36796] org.apache.hadoop.mapred.JobACLsManager: checkAccess job acls, jobOwner: yarn jobacl: VIEW_JOB user: user1

The jobOwner above is incorrect. It should be user1 since it was user1 who submitted the job.

This error is caused by an incorrect implementation in JobImpl, which has defined two 
user name fields:
username - user got from system property user.name, which is the container process owner
userName - the value is passed in via JobImpl constructor, which is the end user who has submitted the job
The JobImpl#checkAccess method should have used userName as the job owner, instead of username., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

The above test is failing due to the patch seems, Could you have a look into this test failure., Thank you Devaraj.

The test failed due to the test code passing in null value for userName parameter when initiating a JobImpl object. Attaching a new patch to fix this., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, [~eyang] - when resolving a JIRA as Fixed, we should add a FixVersion. , Also, for CHANGES.txt changes, we typically append at the end of the appropriate section. I just fixed up the CHANGES.txt entry for this JIRA in trunk, branch-2, branch-2.5 and branch-2.5.1. ]
