This message was automatically generated., As with HDFS-8362, it might be better to move into the hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce directory (where the majority of the tests are).  The mapred directory is probably for tests inherited from MR1., bq. it might be better to move into the hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-app/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce directory
Yes, thats sounds reasonable to be as well.
[~arshad.mohammad], can you post one more patch which moves the file itself instead of importing other things to current file. ?, moved TestMapreduceConfigFields to org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce package, Patch didnt include the deleted file. This will be considered as new file. not moved file.
Plz check again., \\

This message was automatically generated., now patch includes the deleted file also., Thanks  a lot [~vinayrpet]
At first I created patch including the deleted file but was not able to apply on another local trunk repo. So committed the patch locally and then generated the path and then i was able to apply the path on trunk. This why i included only one file.
Anyway I have created and submitted the patch again with both files., +1 for the latest patch.
Waiting for jenkins, \\
