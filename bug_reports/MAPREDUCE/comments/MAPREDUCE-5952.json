[Found while working on the test for MAPREDUCE-207, v01 patch for review., The fix seems reasonable to me.

[~kasha], no that was my rebase mistake. I replaced private renameMapOutputForReduce by a 'protected static', but the old method definition remained in the file due to the merge error. Attaching v03 with the private renameMapOutputForReduce finally deleted., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Looks like the new patch moves the method to a different line number in the file. Can we keep it in place for better history tracking? Sorry for the additional inconvenience. , [~kasha], the reason the method was moved because it's static in nature (does not need any instance fields) and I needed to make it static for easier testability. {{EventHandler}} is not a static inner class. Making it static will also move other methods around. Here is v04 that avoids moving {{renameMapOutputForReduce}} but it will remain an instance method., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks [~jira.shegalov]. Missed the fact that the method was moved out of the class. I agree with you making it static is a better approach; i.e., MAPREDUCE-5952.v03.patch.
