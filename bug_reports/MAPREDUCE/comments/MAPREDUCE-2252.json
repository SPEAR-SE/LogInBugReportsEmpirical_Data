[More generally we should probably register a jetty ErrorHandler which escapes the output of exception traces. org.mortbay.jetty.handler.ErrorHandler is the default and has this lack of escaping that causes the bug., I believe this is fixed by virtue of our upgrading jetty to 6.1.26, Sounds like it's not a problem anymore.]
