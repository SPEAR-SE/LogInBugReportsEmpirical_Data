[FileInputFormat does not require that the file is a plain text file broken into lines with carriage-return or linefeed used as line delimiters.  That's what TextInputFormat is for.

FileInputFormat is an abstract class that makes no assumptions about how the data in the file is formatted.  Concrete implementations that derive from FileInputFormat must implement the getRecordReader method which will dictate how the records are read from the file and therefore what the format must be for that particular input format., Closing this as FileInputFormat is not supposed to specify the specifics on the file format per the previous comment., Please add your comments to the javadoc.
That will help people understand the class better.

Either linefeed or carriage-return are used to signal end of line. Keys are
the position in the file, and values are the line of text..
