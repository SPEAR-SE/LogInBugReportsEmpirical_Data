[HADOOP-8899 added the classpath jar bundling logic to branch-1-win.  YARN-316 is porting that logic to YARN on branch-trunk-win.  While working on the YARN port, I discovered these issues with handling of environment variables and wildcards.  The YARN-316 patch will handle these cases for YARN.  I'm filing this jira to backport the same logic to branch-1-win., Expanding scope of target versions to include next unreleased 1.x version, 1.3.0.  HBase and others would benefit from having this code in branch-1, as per discussion on YARN-358.

[~ndimiduk], you mentioned needing this in 1.1.x.  Would it be acceptable for HBase to upgrade to 1.3.0 to pick up this change, or would it really need to be a new 1.1.x version?, As I consider this further, I don't think generating a temp jar is sufficient for our needs. What we want is the hbase-manifest.jar to be created a install time, once all of the path structures are resolved.

HBase's current minimum Hadoop version is at 1.1.2. I don't know what the future will hold.

Ping [~apurtell] for thoughts on both points.]
