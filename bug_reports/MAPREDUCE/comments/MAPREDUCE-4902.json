This message is automatically generated., +1, lgtm., Thanks, Albert.  I committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-0.23.

Note that in the future, please don't set the "Fix Version/s" field, as that is reserved for noting which versions actually contain the fix once committed.  The "Target Version/s" field is what should be set instead, as it indicates which versions are targeted to be fixed., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #476 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/476/])
