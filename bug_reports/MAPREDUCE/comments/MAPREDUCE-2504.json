[Patch. Fixes the condition to be 'stopped' OR 'interrupted'.
Unsets the interrupted status if it is set before calling handleEvent, The code looks correct but a bit too tricky for application (vs library) code. Need a bit more comment about ensuring all remaining events are handled in the event of interrupt from the stop method. I think we should probably refactor the event queue into the common event package and add some unit tests for it., Added some comments about the interrupt status reset.
, Removed part of the interrupted check + set which went in accidentally. , I just committed this to MR-279. thanks sid!]
