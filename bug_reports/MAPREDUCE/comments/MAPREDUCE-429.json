[Attached patch makes NONE the default and add the property to hadoop-default.xml, +1, because http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12349421/HADOOP-919.patch applied and successfully tested against trunk revision r498829., I agree that we should add a default value to hadoop-default.xml, but I don't think it sholuld be NONE, I think it should be FAILED, but that the output should be much more brief.  Folks shouldn't see the full stack dump for every  thread, but rather just a one-line message indicating that the task has failed.  The gory details should be available through the web ui and logs.  Perhaps the one-line message could even include a link to the gory details?, Another reduction that would be nice is to have a single lost task tracker event rather than losing all 300 map tasks that were stored on that machine. I'd much rather get a single line saying "task tracker node1234 lost" than 300 task failure reports., This is no longer a simple config file fix.  Someone else is welcome to pick it up., Without being aware of HADOOP-919, I've added 'jobclient.output.filter' to hadoop-default.xml (default value of 'FAILED') while on HADOOP-977; should we close this bug and open a new 'Improvement' bug to track Owen's request (i.e. add a TrackerFailure event) ?, This was not closed earlier. Closing out now, has gone stale.]
