[See my comments on YARN-151., I also need the data to graph in MAPREDUCE-4747. Probably not all of it, but some of it
, Let me clarify. Not the data on the RM page. But, on the job Page of the AM and the HS. This data is written onto the page, using Hamster. Hence, it affects 4747. No other reason! :), Hi Luke!

Here's a patch for using deferred rendering. However, it doesn't seem to produce a lot of difference with bDeferRender set to false. :( Could you please take a look?

The way I tested it was by producing 20000 fake jobs in the for loop. , Have you upgraded datatables as well? I think the bundled version is 1.7.5, which doesn't have the option. BTW, Can you use curl or wget to verify the server download speed? I want to rule whether if we hit the same jetty buffering issue for large output as in MAPREDUCE-4399., Thanks for that Luke! I *had* updated it in a separate branch and forgot to include it in the patch. Here's the whole branch. I generated this patch using git diff --binary --no-prefix --full-index . I have yet to figure out how to apply this using patch.

Nathan had suggested me to use YSlow and fix the bad grade it gave. I put in a few improvements:
1. Combined multiple Javascript files so that fewer HTTP connections are opened.
2. Static content is being sent with the "Expires" header set to an year from when the request is made.
3. Datatables upgraded and deferred rendering.

Its taking about 8 seconds to render the 20000 fake jobs. An improvement from 11 seconds but still leaves something to be desired.

Questions:
1. Should I combine all the JS files? Or only the well known jquery, jquery-ui and jquery-datatables libraries?
2. Should I version the static directory? I didn't feel the need because a refresh on the client browser can be made to refetch the un-expired content anyway.
3. Is there anything else we should be doing?, There is no need to combine the js files, as these requests should be a fraction of the that 8 seconds and mostly cached. Can you post the entire profile of the request? I recall that you said on YARN-151, 20k rows only takes 1 second to render with deferred rendering.

BTW, git apply <patch> would work., And curling:
$ time curl --compressed --socks5 someSocksServer:port http://someJobHistoryServer:19888/jobhistory > file
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed
100  465k    0  465k    0     0   152k      0 --:--:--  0:00:03 --:--:--  159k

real	0m3.074s
user	0m0.046s
sys	0m0.031s

So curling is pretty fast. It resulted in a 13Mb file after decompression. 
, Thanks for the prompt reply Luke! The above curl was from a remote JHS. The 11 second time was from a dev-box local psuedo-distributed cluster. I am wondering if there are some DataTables options we are using which is making it slower? For instance, in the test file I created, I hadn't made any of the fields searchable. 
, What's the number without --compressed? Please also test against the local dev box. I don't think browsers are requesting compressed out by default., Hi Luke!

For 20000 jobs
$ time curl localhost:19888/jobhistory > file
  % Total    % Received % Xferd  Average Speed   Time    Time     Time  Current
                                 Dload  Upload   Total   Spent    Left  Speed

So I doubt that the Jetty server is having trouble streaming the data., This is the final patch for branch-0.23. It adds deferred rendering to the HS jobs page and HS Job Tasks page. Both of the tables on these pages can become pretty big.

I notice that you upgraded the themes for trunk, and a bit for 0.23 as well.  Could we try and get in MAPREDUCE-4221 first, so we don't have to deal as much with all of the themes?  I will try to get 4221 in today., Hi Bobby!

Yes! That makes sense. However I'm blocked by this JIRA on MAPREDUCE-4747, so I wouldn't want to wait too long., Uploading patches again. Please review and commit, The patch for trunk applies to branch-2 as well, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Please replace usage of StringBuffer with StringBuilder and use a more idiomatic usage for repeated append i.e., do not repeat the object unnecessarily., Also there does not appear to be any escaping when you are generating the JSON array.  This is mostly with the job name, which I have seen some very strange names, like with a '\n' in them, but it could also lead to a XSS if the name is maliciously formatted., Yes, anything contains the job name definitely needs to be escaped in the JSON stuff. Too bad I didn't have time to push out JSonnet :), Thanks Luke and Bobby for your reviews! I've incorporated your comments in these latest patches.

, It really should use escapeHtml (will already escape quotes) instead of escapeJavascript for the job names. Sigh., D-oh! Thanks Luke! I'll patch it in another JIRA (for deferred rendering in AM tasks page)., I've filed MAPREDUCE-4802 for this. I'll also patch the escape method over there., I am also experiencing this slowness on my set up. I am using Apache Hadoop 2.6.0 (comes as part of CDH-5.7.0). In my clusters, there are many jobs running and it reaches 20k applications with in 4-5 days. Though yarn log retention policy has been configured as 30 days, I am able to see max 20k applications. JHS UI is pulling max 20k applications and it is taking long time to load. Also, 

1. Is there a way to increase the count from 20K?
2. Is there a way to increase length of application name (being displayed in UI) as it is getting truncated?, I figured out how to increase the count using mapreduce.jobhistory.joblist.cache.size, but increasing job name length using mapreduce.jobhistory.jobname.limit is not working. It is not considering new value and still works based on old default value (50).

However, loading of JHS UI is slow.]
