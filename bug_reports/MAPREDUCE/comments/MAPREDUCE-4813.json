[Posting a rough patch for comment.  It adds a new, interal COMMITTING state to JobImpl.  It's missing the state transition tests for the new state and also breaks a fair number of tests that are confused by the new state.  I wanted to get this out there for initial comment in case this isn't the direction people think this should go., Started looking at the patch but realized a thing. When we fix MAPREDUCE-4815, commitJob won't be expensive anymore? We still need to make sure that a hung DFS move doesn't make the AM timeout, but I believe that is automatically handled via RPC timeouts for e.g., MAPREDUCE-4815 only addresses FileOutputCommitter and friends, but the committer is arbitrary user code.  It could be doing all sorts of things including connecting to databases, etc.  So I still think we need this, although the priority of it is reduced given how many things are built from FileOutputCommitter., Patch that fixes the unit test failures and adds some testing of the new COMMITTING state.  As a bonus, most of the tests in TestJobImpl actually test a JobImpl object rather than a mock of it.
, bq. So I still think we need this
Agreed, also we need a fix before MAPREDUCE-4815 is resolved. So let's get this in. Looking at the patch now., Some comments on the patch:
 - Similar to JobCommitFailedEvent, add an event class for JOB_COMMIT_COMPLETED.
 - JobImpl.checkJobCompleteSuccess() and corresponding return variables should be renamed to mean checkIfJobReadyForCommit(). Similary, checkJobForCompletion(job).
 - For now, we may be just be addressing MAPREDUCE-4815, but the same argument of committer being arbitrary user code is valid for other calls like abortJob, setupJob too. We will need states capturing those calls and put them on separate threads so that dispatches isn't blocked. We can do that later, but to be future-proof, let's move the committer-thread to a top-level service ala TaskCleaner. We may even re-purpose TaskCleanerImpl for this. Scope the effort and split it as you see fit.
 - Commit-thread interrupting and joining is only meaning-ful in the case of kill-during-commit. So let's move that code there. Also, earlier, we never supported kill-during-commit, but now we do and the patch is putting a 60second upper bound on commitJob() before abortJob(). Comparing this with 1.*, we do allow kill-during-commit as commit happens in a separate JVM. So interrupt and join seems fine, let's just put in a config so that we can tweak if ever there is a need.
 - The test looks good. Can you extend it to include kill-during-commit too. That will also validate that the dispatcher isn't blocked anymore because of long commit., Thanks for the review, Vinod!  I've attached a patch that hopefully addresses most of your comments.

I agree that abortJob, setupJob, etc. need to be handled as well, as those could take an arbitrary amount of time as well.  Adding a new top-level service, associated events for that service, and new state machine wait states will be a bit involved, and I'm keen on getting a fix for the now common case of long job commits.  If it's OK with you, I'd like to tackle that review comment in a separate JIRA., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Per Vinod's suggestions, I updated the patch to move all of the committer interactions in JobImpl to a separate CommitterEventHandler which was previously known as TaskCleaner.

The asynchronous processing of committer callbacks required adding new internal states to JobImpl, specifically:

* SETUP which occurs after INITED while processing the setupJob callback
* COMMITTING which occurs after RUNNING while processing the commitJob callback
* FAIL_ABORT which occurs prior to FAILED while proccessing the abortJob callback
* KILL_ABORT which occurs prior to KILLED while processing the abortJob callback

One significant shift with this rework is that the committer's setupJob call is now performed *after* INITED and after the job reports externally that it is RUNNING.  Previously it processed the setupJob callback synchronously within the MRAppMaster.start method, and this seemed like the cleanest way to handle the now asynchronous nature of the committer callback.

This message is automatically generated., I have gone through the state machine for JobImpl, and I think I have found a few issues.  I am not done with my review, but I wanted to give you a heads up on them.

It looks like it may be possible to get a JOB_START event after a JOB_KILL event.  This would be a very rare race condition where someone is trying to kill their job right after starting it.  I am not sure if it is even possible in practice, especially after this patch where the setup is removed from the critical path. So I would suggest that we file a minor JIRA to fix this at some point.

Also it looks like we need to handle JOB_MAP_TASK_RESCHEDULED and JOB_TASK_ATTEMPT_COMPLETED in the FAIL_ABORT state.  In the KILL_ABORT state we don't need to worry about them because the KILL_WAIT state should make sure all tasks have completed before going on, but there is no corresponding FAIL_WAIT state. , I have a few minor comments about CommitterEventHandler and one more serious one as well. When checking for the timeout we call context.getClock().getTime() twice.
{code}
// wait up to configured timeout for commit thread to finish
long timeoutTimestamp = context.getClock().getTime()
 + commitThreadCancelTimeoutMs;
long now = context.getClock().getTime();
{code}

I personally think it would be cleaner to call it once
{code}
// wait up to configured timeout for commit thread to finish
long now = context.getClock().getTime();
long timeoutTimestamp = now + commitThreadCancelTimeoutMs;
{code}

Also I noticed some inconsistencies in the error handling of various functions. In some places to get a message for an event we call {code}StringUtils.stringifyException(e){code} but in others it is just call {code}e.getMessage(){code} I am not sure if there is a reason for this or not, but I would prefer it to be consistent.

On a bit more serious note it looks like if we get any RuntimeException or Error while processing jobSetup, etc. the exception will be eaten.  We are not catching it and threadpool will likely just eat it.  This could result in a deadlock.  I would suggest at a minimum we catch all Exceptions instead of just IOException.
, Thanks for the review, Bobby.  Updated the patch to address the review comments:

* I went ahead and fixed the JOB_START in KILLED race since it's a one-line fix to ignore that event.
* I noticed that JOB_TASK_COMPLETED also needs to be handled in the FAIL_ABORT state.
* The commit cancel wait loop was busted, as it needs to recompute {{now}} within the loop to function properly.
* Standardized on StringUtils.stringifyException to report committer exceptions in diagnostics.  I had previously preserved the existing behavior, but I agree we should be consistent.
* Updated IOException to Exception within the try block of committer calls to make sure we don't "leak" exceptions and deadlock., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
