[This only seems to occur when security is enabled., Sorry, I was wrong.  It appears it will happen without security as well.  The problem is that the job token is rolled from scratch each time the AM starts up, so the subsequent AM attempt has no idea what job token was used by the previous attempt.  My non-secure cluster was only one node, and any node that launches a container for the new AM attempt will smash the old shuffle token with the new one.  Any node that only ran tasks for the old AM attempt will report shuffle verification failures from reduce tasks launched by the new AM attempt., This is complicated by the fact that the job token currently serves a dual-role to authenticate both the shuffle *and* the task umbilical.  The former is something that should persist across app attempts, while the latter should not.  We don't want old task attempts authenticating with the new app attempt, at least not at this point.  It would only serve to confuse the new app attempt.

Therefore I propose the following:

* The current job token remains primarily as-is for the authenticating of the task umbilical, and each AM attempt continues to generate its own job token.
* A new secret key, the shuffle secret, will be generated by the job client when the job is submitted as part of the job's credentials.  Each app attempt will extract the shuffle secret from the job's credentials and use it as the shared secret to authenticate the shuffle

Attaching the first draft of a patch that implements that proposal.  It needs unit tests, but I've manually tested that it can recover map tasks and successfully shuffle their data., Minor update to patch to fix some test failures, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Release audit warnings are unrelated to the patch., In my prelim security work, I once had the JobClient generate the secret and then later had the MR AM generate the tokens and reupload the tokens file into the submit directory. That was another hop to DFS and we changed that since, but this recovery code bug fell through. So there are multiple solutions:
 - Have a single secret but let the client generate it
 - Have a single secret but upload the tokens file for future app-attempts
 - Have multiple tokens

It's future proof to separate the task and shuffle security secrets, but not sure that is tied in directly to this one if we consider the reupload solution.

I don't feel strongly about any solution, but one thing we should keep in mind is to move as much stuff into the AM so that the client is thinner and enables us to do submits via web services., I thought about the upload-to-staging-for-future-attempts solution but it seemed passing the secret in the job credentials was a bit cleaner and avoided the extra HDFS operations.

As for splitting the job token into shuffle and task, I didn't want to change the current task authentication behavior.  Allowing an old task attempt to authenticate with a new app attempt seemed like it would be a problem waiting to happen.  But we need the shuffle secret to persist across app attempts, hence the push to split them as part of this change., Arun requested I make this a blocker for 2.0.4-alpha., Patch that adds a unit test to verify recovery does not try to recover if the shuffle secret was not provided as part of the job credentials.

I also fixed some tests in TestPipeApplication that had hardcoded the unexposed name of the job token which changed in the patch., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
