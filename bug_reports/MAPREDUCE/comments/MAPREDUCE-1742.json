[I think this is a blocker., Danny, Can you give more details on how you are hitting this? 
I strongly feel this is not broken because there are many unit tests and examples calling this api and none of them fail., I just ran some examples and I see number of reduce tasks being picked up properly., Danny, is this failing for you? If not, I think we can close the issue., This is no longer an issue for me.
I think it had to do with configuration changes between hadoop versions (i.e. the new 'mapreduce.job.maps')., Thanks Danny.
I'm resolving this as invalid.]
