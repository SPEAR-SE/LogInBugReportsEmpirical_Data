[See Jenkins test failure at https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/622/testReport/ . Fails on a clean trunk on my local box too., looks like the changes that went into trunk recently (aren't in branch 23 yet) broke this.  Investigating fix.  

HADOOP-7524 and MapReduce-2887 Change RPC to allow multiple protocols including multuple versions of the same protocol., Updated the nm and rm auditlogger tests to use the new RPC.getServer api.  tests pass now., Looks like the issue is only on trunk., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Though moving to the new API should work, I think this is a bug with the patch at HADOOP-7524, that should have been backwards compatible. Commenting there.

Also, in the patch, we can simply pass a null for the SecretManager instead of forcibly using ContainerTokenSecretManager., updated patch to pass null as secretmanager., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
