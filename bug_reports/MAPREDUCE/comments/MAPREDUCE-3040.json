[Thomas - look like MAPREDUCE-1788 broke it. Let me fix this. Apologies!, Fixed YarnClientProtocolProvider.java/YARNRunner to not make a copy of the user's job conf at construction time.

OTOH, ResoureMgrDelegate needs YarnConfiguration which I fixed too., TestMRJobsWithHistoryService still fails., Fixed MiniMRYarnCluster to set JH config - this was broken by MAPREDUCE-2925., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

, I merged this into branch-0.23.

I was surprised why we didn't see these failures before, and as it turns out, the patch builds aren't running any of these tests. These tests need the MRApp jar, which isn't generated if we only do "mvn test" like the patch builds. Will fix the test-patch script to run "mvn clean install test" for tests., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk #806 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk/806/])
