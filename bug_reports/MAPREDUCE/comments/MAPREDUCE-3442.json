[If we go down this path and if we have HADOOP-1201 in, then we can probably do away with pings from Tasks to the TaskTracker? ping IPC implementation basically checks for the existence of the taskID string in the tasks map in the TaskTracker & returns a boolean. This check can be done within the progress IPC method equally well., > then we can probably do away with pings from Tasks to the TaskTracker?

Yes, I think so.  The ping thread was required since progress was not reported from a separate thread, and hence was not reliable.  But with progress reports now sent from a separate thread, it should be possible to combine them with pings.  In case it's not obvious, the primary purpose of pings is to make sure that child processes die promptly when their parent dies, when their job is terminated, etc., Moved to MAPREDUCE, was in HDFS accidentally. Unsure yet if this is a problem today, will check later.]
