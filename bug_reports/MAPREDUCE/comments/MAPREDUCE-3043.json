I came across this issue while doing 0.23 backlog review.
Is this issue still a problem? It now appears that there is an accurate "Containers" link off of each Node page, which shows logs and information for containers running on that node.
Is this sufficient? Has the issue raised by this JIRA been resolved?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

Since there has been no response, I am assuming that it is okay to resolve this issue. Please reopen the JIRA if that is a wrong assumption., hi [~eepayne],
The issue looks to be resolved. Thanks for the update.]
