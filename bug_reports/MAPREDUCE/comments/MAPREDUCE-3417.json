[Also note that I tested with valid users and it still allows any user to view the job details even though the job view acls are set to only the job runner.  That was with security on and also used a http filter so that the user id actually shows up., One aspect of the issue I notice. There is a difference in hadoop.security.authentication=simple for accessing the tracking url via the proxy and accessing via the AM directly. The proxy address allows access for invalid users while the AM address disallows access for invalid users(proxy not forwarding on remote user for simple security?), Initial patch contains fixes for Jobhistory server and for working in simple authorization mode. Next patch will include fixes for AM., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I am about to review the patch. Jonathan, in the mean while, can you please outline the cluster tests you did for this? Thanks!, I have tried to access via the trackinging url both the AM and JHS job and task pages both with authorization off, simple authorization on, and kerberos authorization on. I have tested that the job owner always has access to those pages. I have tested non-owner with view acls (both via allAccess -> * and specific users). I have also tested this with both static http users as well as using a custom filter.
.
, Looks good overall. The fix for the main issue is fine. Haven't tested it myself, relying on your tests. Few minor comments: 
 - Instead of Hadoop authorization flag, we should instead be looking at YarnConfiguration#YARN_ACL_ENABLE. It is debatable whether we need a separate config item besides hadoop-auth flag, but let us resolve that separately and be consistent here.
 - Good job on the test! But we shouldn't be needing to set MRConfig.MR_ACLS_ENABLED as that is a MRV1 config which we don't want to use here at all.
 - Am not sure of the expected behavior of the proxy. Can Robert/Thomas pitch in?, bq. Instead of Hadoop authorization flag, we should instead be looking at YarnConfiguration#YARN_ACL_ENABLE. It is debatable whether we need a separate config item besides hadoop-auth flag, but let us resolve that separately and be consistent here.
After discussing with Vinod, the correct setting for now will be MRConfig.MR_ACLS_ENABLED. Since that is already checked in JobACLsManager, I just deleted the AUTHORIZATION check in JobImpl and CompletedJob
bq. Good job on the test! But we shouldn't be needing to set MRConfig.MR_ACLS_ENABLED as that is a MRV1 config which we don't want to use here at all.
As part of changes with first comment, now setting only MR_ACLS_ENABLED and removed AUTHORIZATION set in test code
bq. Am not sure of the expected behavior of the proxy. Can Robert/Thomas pitch in?
Will ping one of them to take a look at the proxy change, I just looked at the proxy changes and I am a bit confused why they are needed.  If security is enabled the proxy will try to warn the user that they may be connecting to something that is unsafe.  It should not change anything about sending the user name over to the AM.  All the changes seem to be doing is enabling warning people if the authentication is set to anything that does not evaluate to a boolean false, so it would be enabled for both kerberos and simple, iff simple is explicitly set., Removed the WebAppProxy changes and everything still works! Thanks, Bobby., Latest patch removed the unnecessary WebAppProxy changes and addressed comments from @Vinod., Patch looks good now. +1.

Will push this in when Jenkins comes back with its blessings., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
