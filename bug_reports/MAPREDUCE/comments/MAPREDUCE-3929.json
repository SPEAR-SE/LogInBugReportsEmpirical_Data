[The following are the inconsistencies or confusing output that I see. 

1. If the parent queue specifically defines a value in capacity-scheduler.xml, it shows up in its permitted operation and any of the children derived from it. If a parent queue derives this value (from its forefathers) this value will not be shown.
2. root even though is a parent queue, will show the operation it is allowed even if it is by omission, but none of the other parent queues show that.

Here is the output of a mapred -showacl command:
Queue  Operations
=====================
root  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
a  SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
a1  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
a2  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
b  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
c  
c1  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
c2  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS
d  ADMINISTER_QUEUE,SUBMIT_APPLICATIONS

Here, the root queue shows that it is allowed both AQ, and SA operations, but parent queue 'a' and 'c' do not list AQ. The reason parent queue 'a' lists SA is because it was specifically mentioned in the config. 

To me, it seems like either the parent queues should show all the operations it's child queues are allowed or not show anything. Making it such that the operations specifically listed in config will only be shown while the other operations (even though are allowed) wont be shown is confusing to the users.

This message is automatically generated., John - could you please add a simple testcase for this? 

Add a utility function (maybe in CSQueueUtils) and write a unit test for it.
