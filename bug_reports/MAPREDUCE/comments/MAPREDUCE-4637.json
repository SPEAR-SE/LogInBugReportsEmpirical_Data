The bugs seems to be in MRClientService.MRClientProtocolHandler#killTaskAttempt() where the handler is sent a TaskAttemptDiagnosticsUpdateEvent. However, in the UNASSIGNED state a TaskAttempt cannot handle this event, so it fails with an error. The simplest fix would be to allow a TaskAttemptDiagnosticsUpdateEvent in the UNASSIGNED state. The same bug occurs with the fail task command. 

This bug was found by Wing Yew Poon., Attaching the patch.

This message is automatically generated., Another option is to validate that a kill is only sent to RUNNING task-attempts. That seems a better option, no?, I think we should kill all the tasks irrespective of whatever state they are in. Isn't it?
, Looking at the state transition diagrams (attached) it's possible to kill a job, task or task attempt in any of their pre-running states: NEW, INITED/SCHEDULED/(UN)ASSIGNED. I don't see a reason to change that since users may have a reason to kill a task attempt before it is running. The bug here is that the unassigned state of the task attempt does not have a TA_DIAGNOSTICS_UPDATE transition which causes the kill to fail.

I just noticed that job has a JOB_DIAGNOSTIC_UPDATE transition from both the NEW and INITED states, so perhaps we should extend the patch to add a TA_DIAGNOSTICS_UPDATE from the NEW state of task attempt too for completeness., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Tom for sending the state diagram. It is very helpful.

I think its a good idea for adding TA_DIAGNOSTICS_UPDATE from the NEW state.

Arun,

Do you think its reasonable?

I can add this state in this patch itself or you want me to open another jira for that?

Thanks,
Mayank
, BTW you can generate the state diagram by following the instructions in YARN's README., Based on Tom's suggestion extending patch for the new state as well.

A kill seems to be a valid operation before an attempt starts. At a later point, maybe we should include diagnostic messages along with the actual event instead of 2 independent events.

The patch needs some minor changes though. There's an extra Diagnostic Event being generated from TaskImpl - which isn't required. The unit tests may be mocking more than they should, but I don't see that as being an issue., Thanks sid for the review, I updated the patch with your comments. I rebased the patch as well with the latest source.
