[I will take look at this issue. , There two GenericLoadGenerator classes in current Hadoop source code. 
  One is under org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce package. It has two documentation problems. Firstly, it does not actually parse the "-m" command line option but still show this option in the "Usage". Secondly, if user does not specify the input directory, it will create input data using RandomWriter with default setting( 10GB per map task and 10 map task per node). However, it does not show this option in the "Usage". 

  The other is under org.apache.hadoop.mapred package; It is an older version of GenericLoadGenerator. It has the second documentation problem described in above paragraph. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message was automatically generated., Mostly looks good to me. Two comments:
1. For mapred/GenericMRLoadGenerator, would you document that the number of map tasks specified by -m option is overridden when -indir is not specified?
2. 
{code}
+    "RandomWriter will be used to create input directory and data if \"-indir\"" +
{code}
{code}
+    "RandomWriter will be used to create input directory and data if [-indir]" +
{code}
Is there any reason to use different form for -indir?, Thank you for the review [~ajisakaa]. I will update this weekend.]
