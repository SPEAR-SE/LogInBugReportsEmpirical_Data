[Patch so YARNRunner adds {{PWD}} to the front of LD_LIBRARY_PATH.  Tested via a unit test in the patch and manually tested by running a job with -Dyarn.app.mapreduce.am.env='LD_DEBUG=libs' and examining the search path logs emitted from the dynamic linker., I think for uber mode to be complete transparent, the logic should be identical to {{TaskAttemptImpl}}.  Ie. use {{crossPlatformifyMREnv}} for LD_LIBRARY_PATH and also set SHELL., Thanks for the review, Daryn!  I updated the patch to match TaskAttemptImpl and also added SHELL settings to the AM env., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
