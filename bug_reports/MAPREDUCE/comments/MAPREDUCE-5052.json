[In REST API for job listing, startTime and finishTime are being fetched from the job history file name. To be precise it is calling FileNameIndexUtils.getIndexInfo(). So adding a submitTime field will result in startTime having no value(as the file name does not contain the startTime info) and submitTime having job submitted value which is currently available as part of file name.

Is there a way to get the startTime for each of the jobs as this is not available in the job history file name?, When a job is submitted to the system, RM will record the submit time. However, this job will be initialized till it is allowed to create a ApplicationMaster. This time point is recorded in JobImpl calss when the MRAppMaster starts. It is called "launchTime". In my opinion, 
a job's queuing time equals "launchTime - submitTime"; The "startTime" is ambiguous because it may refer to the startTime of the AM or the startTime of the first map task. If there is no objection, I suggest we put the "launchTime" there instead of "startTime".  
 , updated "startTime" to "submitTime" on RM WebUI page
add "submitTime" column on the JobHistory page, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The error caused by org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.v2.app.TestRMContainerAllocator is related to MAPREDUCE-3776, Hi Chen. Thanks for putting up a patch for this item. Will be very useful to many.
Couple of minor things based on my first pass of reading. Will add more details as I dive deeper into this.
  - Please update the documentation for the REST api to reflect code changes. Quick scan shows possible locations of updates
  -- hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/HistoryServerRest.apt.vm
  -- hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/MapredAppMasterRest.apt.vm
  -- hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/ResourceManagerRest.apt.vm
  -- hadoop-yarn-project/hadoop-yarn/hadoop-yarn-site/src/site/apt/WebServicesIntro.apt.vm
  - Still feel there is confusion about using the term launch time vs start time. Seems there is already a precedence in RM and AM for the term start time.
  - Assert description mismatch in _Assert.assertEquals("Queue name different after encoding and decoding", info.getLaunchTime(), parsedInfo.getLaunchTime());_
, updated HistoryServerRest.apt.vm
other vm files are not related to this patch.
I will file a jira if there is any vm file out of date, then update it., BTW, to avoid confusion, change LaunchTime to jobStartTime;
update the Assert description to "Job Start time different after encoding and decoding";, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

For jobs and applications that generated by Hadoop without this patch, the startTime will become "1969.12.31 16:00:00 PST" on the  http://hostname:port/jobhistory/app page. This is because history files' names generated by Hadoop without this patch do have startTime field.
