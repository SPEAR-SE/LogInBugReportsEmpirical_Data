[I understand this to be related to MAPREDUCE-1641 .  I am marking it as a duplication., The failure actually occurred because the user had entered the same URL both as an archive to be burst [ {{mapred.cache.archives}} ] and as an individual file [ {{mapred.cache.files}} ] .  I therefore mark this as a duplicate.]
