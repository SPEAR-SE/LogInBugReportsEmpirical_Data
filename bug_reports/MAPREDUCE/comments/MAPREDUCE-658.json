[Attaching patch that makes distcp to emit proper exception with meaningful error message in the case of 'source path does not exist'.
Also emits a meaningful error message in map if any of the source files is not accessible(dfs is not accessible or the file is deleted).

Please review and provide your comments., I suggest change the message "Either the dfs is ... " to "Either the file system is ... " since the file system may not be a dfs.  It may even be better to obtain the fs info from the src fs or the FNFE object., Attaching new patch with suggested changes., +1 patch looks good., {noformat}
