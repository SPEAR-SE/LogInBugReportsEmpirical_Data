{code}, This one job blocks gridmix whenever it happens., Attaching patch that should fix this.
 - Making sure that EventFetcher is shutdown properly.
 - Did the same for the Fetchers too which can cause a similar race condition and hang.

No tests, only fix is to makes the threads shutdown properly. Would've added if any of these had prior tests, unfortunately that isn't the case., Patch looks good. One minor change - can the {{join}} be timed - something like 5 seconds., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
