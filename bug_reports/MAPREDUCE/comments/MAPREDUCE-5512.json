[Attached is the TT stack dump and TT log., Attaching the patch.

My proposal for the fix is to make the dist cache cleanup thread a daemon. Based on the scan thru the code I think it should be safe to make this change. 

For the unittest, I added a test that validates the list of non-daemon threads. This is a more general test case but I think it will serve well to protect the codebase against regressions in this area. I was not able to come up with a nice way to simulate the condition from this bug without adding a test hook in the production code, so I moved away from this approach (we would have to start JT, stop JT, start JT again which would tell TT to reinit, and then stop JT, but last JT stop must have the right timing and run before TT#initialize() executes).

Slightly orthogonally, looking at the list of threads I had to whitelist, there might be some other candidate threads that could be made daemons, but I'd prefer not to make this change in the context of this Jira., +1 for the patch.  Thanks, Ivan., Thanks Chris for the review, will commit the patch shortly., Fix committed to branch-1 and branch-1-win. ]
