[Thanks for the report Sebastian, does this look like a dupe of MAPREDUCE-6238 to you? If so, can you try out the fix under review on it, and close this as dupe?, The issue looks like a duplicate to MAPREDUCE-6238 whereas the entry point is a little bit different.
I add the JARs not (all) via {{-libjars}} but via  {{TableMapReduceUtil.initTableReducerJob}} (HBase code) - which ends up in the same JobConfiguration property as the command line argument., For those how come around and have the same problem:

It can be work-arounded with getting away from local setup:
Adopt your pseudo-distributed setup as:
{{mapred-site.xml}} - set framework name not to be {{local}} but {{yarn}}
{code:xml}<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>mapreduce.framework.name</name>
    <value>yarn</value>
  </property>
</configuration>{code}

Ensure that your {{yarn-site.xml}} is ready to go:
{code:xml}<configuration>
  <property>
    <name>yarn.resourcemanager.hostname</name>
    <value>localhost</value>
  </property>
  <property>
    <name>yarn.nodemanager.aux-services</name>
    <value>mapreduce_shuffle</value>
  </property>
</configuration>{code}
