This message is automatically generated., Patch mostly looks good. Minor comments:
 - I see a bunch of other transitions missing in Application. Let's do all of that separately, the ignored transitions in the patch also may not really be ignored. Let's drop those changes.
 - TestApplication.WrappedApplication.finishContainer() can be renamed to containerFinished()

Also verified that all files are getting deleted properly now on my single-node secure setup., Update patch with review feedback., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
