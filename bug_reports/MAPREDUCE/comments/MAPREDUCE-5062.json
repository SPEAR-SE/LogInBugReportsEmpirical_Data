[It's the patch which is split from the one in YARN-378 and which is restricted in the scope of mapreduce. It includes the following features:

1. Defining the max attempts configuration in MRJobConfig and mapred-default.xml.

2. Sending the number through ApplicationSubmissionContext.

3. RM AM's reading the number from environment.

This message is automatically generated., Reviewed the MR changesfrom latest patch at YARN-378. Looks good.

I just made two edits to change the default mapreduce.am.max-attempts to be 4, to match the default at RM., Reverting the retry number to 1 as YARN-378 set that to 1 on RM side. I think we should change that, perhaps in a separate ticket.

I'm checking this in to unblock builds., I just committed this to trunk and branch-2. Thanks Zhijie!, Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3526 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3526/])
