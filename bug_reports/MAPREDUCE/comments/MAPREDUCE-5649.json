[Folks, is there any reason behind limiting this amount of memory to 2GB ?, I changed the code to make it long and it lowered the disk spills considerably when enough memory is given to reducers. There are some other places where Interger.MAX_VALUE is used which need be corrected. 

In MergeManagerImpl.java following code is changed to use Long value,

- int maxInMemReduce = (int)Math.min(
-        Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory() * maxRedPer, Integer.MAX_VALUE);

+long maxInMemReduce = Math.min(
+        (long)(Runtime.getRuntime().maxMemory() * maxRedPer), Long.MAX_VALUE);

I will submit the patch soon. 


, [~vgogate@gopivotal.com], [~milindb], are you going to submit the patch?, Sorry for putting it on a back-burner, but will submit the patch soon.  --Suhas, $ find . -name "*.java" | xargs grep -Eni "Runtime.*getRuntime.*maxMemory"

This message is automatically generated., [~jlowe], [~kasha], please review if you get a chance., In general looks OK to me.  Couple of nits:

We're taking a transient computation and storing it long-term apparently only for unit testing purposes.  I think we can unit test it in a way that doesn't require long-term storage.  We could allow createInMemorySegments to be overridden in a derived test class so we could spy on the parameters to verify the value comes out as expected.

This runtime exception message is not going to be very user-friendly.  I realize it did not originate with this patch, but since we're touching that code it would be nice to clean it up a bit:
{code}
+    if (maxRedPer > 1.0 || maxRedPer < 0.0) {
+      throw new RuntimeException(MRJobConfig.REDUCE_INPUT_BUFFER_PERCENT +
+          maxRedPer);
+    }
{code}
, Thanks for review, [~jlowe]! 002.patch , \\

, Pulled this into 2.6.1. Ran compilation and TestMergeManager before the push. Patch applied cleanly., Just pulled this into branch-2.7 (release 2.7.2) as it already exists in 2.6.1.

branch-2 patch applies cleanly. Ran compilation and TestMergeManager before the push.]
