Summary
-------

•I removed the Apps.toString(ApplicationId id) method from o.a.h.yarn.util.Apps.java
•The Apps.toString(ApplicationId id) method was used by webapp APIs.
•Since this toString method has an ApplicationId as it's parameter, I replaced every call to Apps.tostring(ApplicationId id) with a call to ApplicationId.toString().
•The result is that in the yarn UI pages, job names now have the form application_<epoch>_<job num> rather than app_<epoch>_<job num> (See Screenshot AppStringNowApplicationString.2011-09-09.PNG)


This addresses bug MAPREDUCE-2874.
