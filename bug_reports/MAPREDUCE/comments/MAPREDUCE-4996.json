[Did necessary steps as mentioned in the hadoop-0.23.5 docs. But cannot able to start resourcemanager. Please help, It looks like you classpath for the RM is not set up correctly and is missing hadoop common.  What part of the hadoop-0.23.5 docs did you follow?  If this is a documentation bug then we should fix it.]
