This message is automatically generated., Test failure is due to MAPREDUCE-1834.

bq. -1 tests included.
The patch removes unused code. So, no tests are added., There seems to be another config property "stream.debug" that is seen only in some unit tests. I don't know if it was added for some purpose earlier, but it doesn't seem to be used anywhere in source code. So can we remove that also in this patch itself ?, Patch removes stream.debug from testcases and unused stream.recordreader.compression from TestGZipInput. Also removes commented lines in some testcases., bq. unused stream.recordreader.compression from TestGZipInput.
When the test was added,  this configuration was read from StreamLineRecordReader. Now, the RecordReader no more exists., Patch looks good.
