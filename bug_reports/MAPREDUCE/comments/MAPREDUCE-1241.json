[Patch adds a mapred-queues-default.xml into the mapreduce jar (copied from the mapred-queues.xml in the conf/ dir). QueueManager now falls through to the -default version if mapred-queues.xml is not found on the classpath.

This message is automatically generated., Toggling hudson - TestJobHistory test appears to be flaky - I ran it locally and it passed, and it should be completely unrelated.

Regarding the release audit warning, it's for mapred-queues-default.xml. There's no apache license in it, since there isn't in other default XML configs. I think this is OK., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I can see not having the Apache license in the template files, but I think we should have it in the default files. Please add it to the new one., Adds license to mapred-queues-default.xml. Since we're now treating them as separate files, I also got rid of all of the documentation-y comments from -default., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
