This message is automatically generated., Well justification for no test. 
Could not think of any.This is a configuration dependent bug. 

Findbug warnings are not there in my code.

This message is automatically generated., The change looks good to me.  I also don't know what the findbugs is talking about.  As for the tests you could update the some of the integration tests that use the MiniMRYarnCluster to use an ephemeral port., This same bug is getting fixed as part of MAPREDUCE-2986, along with other ports. Mind closing this as duplicate?, MAPREDUCE-2986 , Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
