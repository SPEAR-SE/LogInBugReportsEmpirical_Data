[Attached patch removes maps/reduces count from "job -list" and thus avoids trips to each AM. I added this information instead in "job -status"

Also cleaned up the formatting of the list output. That was long due *smile*, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., A quick look at the patch seems good, but this is undoing some of the work done by MAPREDUCE-2789.  Could you please confirm with Ramya that they are OK with these changes. Ramya filed MAPREDUCE-2789 and I just want to be sure that they get a heads up on the change.  I will try to review the patch more fully., Thanks Robert. Yes, I did confirm offline with Ramya about this change before I even started this. The fact that we don't really have a choice because of the performance implications nails it, and she is okay with it as long as we surface it in job status.

Not a perfect solution, but there isn't a way out. We could add an option to print everything, say -verbose, but I'd like to defer it till it gets escalated., I just committed this.
