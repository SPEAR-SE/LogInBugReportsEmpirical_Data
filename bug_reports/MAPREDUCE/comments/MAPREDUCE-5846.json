This message is automatically generated., verified by running org.apache.hadoop.tools.rumen.TraceBuilder using a 2.4.0 jhist file.

Previously events like the following would fail:
 {"type":"JOB_QUEUE_CHANGED","event":{"org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.jobhistory.JobQueueChange":{"jobid":"job_1397355550089_1126","jobQueueName":"default"}}}
, Thanks Nathan!

I tested this by running a sleep job (and submitting it to a queue) and trying to run TraceBuilder on the folder. It failed. With your patch it works. I'll check it in shortly., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5558 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5558/])
