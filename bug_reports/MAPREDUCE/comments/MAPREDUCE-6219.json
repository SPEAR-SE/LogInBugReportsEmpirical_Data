[One idea: leverage HADOOP-10987 so FileInputFormat.listStatus can iterate the files in chunks and null any BlockLocation entries that are not needed during split computation (e.g.: BlockLocation.names).  We could also consider interning the strings that are being preserved, since a host is probably going to be seen many times across a large number of block locations.]
