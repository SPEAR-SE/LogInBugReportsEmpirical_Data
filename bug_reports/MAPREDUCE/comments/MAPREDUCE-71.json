[{{JobClient}} implements {{Tool}} and hence {{Configurable}}, so {{setConf()}} is a way to do late-binding configuration. To remove the empty constructor, you'd also need to pull this method, the few tests that use it, and run a risk of backwards compatibility. It may be better to have a {{verifyConfigured()}} method on various methods that throws an exception if the class is used before being configured., The JobClient is deprecated. The empty constructor seems to be used only for the ToolRunner so I'm inclined to think it is alright.]
