[Can we also use this same jira for adding any missing entries to the default xml files. For e.g., I see that job retirement related properties (mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.interval, mapred.jobtracker.retirejob.check) are not documented in mapred-default.xml., > Can we also use this same jira for adding any missing entries to the default xml files.

I'm okay with that.  But keep in mind that we should only put stuff into mapred-default.xml if:
 - it is intended as a site-wide, not a per-job, parameter; and
 - we expect to support the feature long-term.
, I'm going to close this as fixed, as there was a major effort to clean this up in 2.x due to the renaming of several config entries.]
