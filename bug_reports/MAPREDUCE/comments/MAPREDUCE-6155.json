[Fix for improved MapFile detection, See [MAPREDUCE-6155.001.patch|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12689130/MAPREDUCE-6155.001.patch].

Changed the way MapFiles are detected. Instead of just using the DATA file blindly when detecting a directory, it is now checked if the directory really has the structure of a MapFile. Plus, if the listStatus method gets a list of files from super.listStatus(), they are checked if they belong to MapFiles. In that case, they are replaced by their respective DATA files., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
