[Hey [~kamrul], are you still working on this issue?

Interested in finding a way to avoid using the .distcp.tmp file because if the target filesystem is S3, then using a .distcp.tmp file involves doing a rename from the tmp file to the final output name. Since renames on S3 require re-writing the file, this can cause a big performance hit for Distcp on S3.]
