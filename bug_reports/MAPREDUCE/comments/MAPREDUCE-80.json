[bq. makeCompactString should be deprecated
+1

bq. The makeEscapeCompactString should be refactored to a non-public class.
What will be reason for doing so? There might a user code that might need to stringify a local counter to write it to a file. The api to de-stringify can be used by the applications that process job logs externally and want to reconstruct the counter., The escaped compact format is only used for the log files. If there is another use, then we can make it public. In the mean time it just makes the public interface bigger and more confusing for users. 

However, it goes deeper than that. In particular, embedding various output formats in the Counters -> Groups -> Counters classes isn't necessary or good. It is better to have the different encodings in different classes that use the standard apis. , adding the requirement here to make the fromEscapedCompactString() API available. It is deprecated in 0.20. Hadoop vaidya contrib project uses it to parse the counter string from job history. (See HADOOP-5582 for more details. It is marked duplicate of this issue.). , This has gone stale as well, not a problem anymore.]
