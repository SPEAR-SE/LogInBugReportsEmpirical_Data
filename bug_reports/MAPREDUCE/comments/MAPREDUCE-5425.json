[Modified the JobHistoryServer.main() to call a package scoped static function that contains the previous contents of main.  This allows the testMain test to call the static function that returns a historyServer instance that can be shutdown.  The testMain test was not being shutdown and was running first in JDK7 which caused the other tests to fail., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for picking this up, Rob.  A few comments:

* I think launchJobHistoryServer would better reflect what the new method is doing.  testMain could be testLaunch to match.
* style nit: comment wraps beyond 80 characters -- not sure comment itself is necessary, Thanks for the review [~jlowe].

This message is automatically generated., Thanks, Rob.  After a second look I noticed something I should have the first time -- the test in question doesn't work properly.  If something in the job history startup does throw, it is calling System.exit directly.  The unit test needs to use ExitUtil.disableSystem and the launch function needs to use ExitUtil.terminate rather than System.exit directly.  Also there's an unused ShutdownHookManager import in TestJobHistoryServer., Jason,
I remove the unused import, and changed the System.exit() to a ExitUtil.terminate. The test itself already had the ExitUtil.disableSystemExit() call. , {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
