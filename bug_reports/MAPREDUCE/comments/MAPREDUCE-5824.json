[The reason is because in windows the path of file is something like : "C:\hadoop\..\". which can not pass StringUtils.unEscapeString() check.
We should use StringUtils.escapeString to escape the "\" for the path just like we did in FileInputFormat.setInputPaths() which can fix the test failure., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., This is an unfortunate burden on users - to make them explicitly escape input paths on Windows - but one that exists already.

Looks good, +1. The test passes after the patch. Checking this in., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Xuan!, To add more context, the (set|add)InputPath(..) methods in FileInputFormat classes can be used directly by users instead of explicit escaping of paths. The test though isn't creating a job, so mapreduce.lib.input.FIF methods cannot be used., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5488 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5488/])
