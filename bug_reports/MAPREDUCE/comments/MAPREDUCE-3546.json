[Todd,
Is this ticket a dup, if so can you close it?, Double checked with folks and this is not a dup, ignore my comment above, The version mismatch issue does seem to be solved by HADOOP-7934.  What's left are multiple binding warnings (all for the same SLF4J versions) which is being tracked by HADOOP-8005.  Any reason to keep this particular issue open?, Marking as duplicate per previous comment.]
