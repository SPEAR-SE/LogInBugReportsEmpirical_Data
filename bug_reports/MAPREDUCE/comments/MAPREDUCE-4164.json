[1. TaskReporter thread sends status updates/pings periodically to TaskTracker. If it needs to send the task progress, it sends STATUS_UPDATE message
to TaskTracker. Otherwise, it sends a PING signal to check if the TaskTracker is alive.

2. When the map/reduce phase is over, it calls stopCommunicationThread() which interrupts ping/statusupdate thread.

3. If the system was trying to communicate with the server at the time of interrupts, it breaks the connection to the
server.Since the interrupt was issued, the stream throws ClosedByInterruptException.

5. However in Client.java, Client keeps waiting for the response and it basically times out and re-throws this exception.

This was affecting our benchmarks, because this was causing task re-executed.
Now benchmarks look really good., I just committed this. Thank you Mayank., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #101 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/101/])
    MAPREDUCE-4164. Fix Communication exception thrown after task completion. Contributed by Mayank Bansal. (Revision 1329486)
