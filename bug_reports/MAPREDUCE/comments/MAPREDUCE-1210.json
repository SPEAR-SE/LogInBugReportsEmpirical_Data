[This is a feature. There are text files out there that only use \r as a line break. In particular old mac files have that format. The most that can be done is to include a switch to turn it off, but the switch must default to off for backwards compatibility., Thanks, Owen, for clarification. Seems like the most flexible solution would be to tell RLR what character(s) should be treated as line terminator.]
