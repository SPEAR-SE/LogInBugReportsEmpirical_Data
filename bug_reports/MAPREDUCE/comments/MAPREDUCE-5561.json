[I reproduced this.

According to the end of the attachment, it seems that CommitterEventHandler had transitioned jobInternalState from FAIL_ABORT to FAILED before assertion.

I think CommitterEventHandler might be stopped when failing the task and it start after assertion.
, The failure doesn't always occur on my environment (Mac OS X 10.8 + Java7). The test often successes but sometimes fails., We see TestJobImpl failing occasionally. As [~ajisakaa] pointed out, it looks like a race. 

IIUC, the purpose of the test is to ensure entering FAIL_ABORT doesn't hang. Given that we know the job is in FAIL_ABORT, the assert might not be necessary. [~jlowe], [~raviprakash] - thoughts? , Yes, the test is definitely racy.  There's no guarantee the job will be in the FAIL_ABORT state while when we look at it asynchronously.  A couple of approaches to fixing this:

# As [~kkambatl] points out, we can skip the FAIL_ABORT check.  The real purpose of this test is to verify we eventually get to the FAILED state without hanging when tasks fail.
# A more deterministic, explicit test for FAIL_ABORT would be to use an output committer with a barrier, similar to TestingOutputCommitter but with the barrier in the abortJob method, so we can guarantee the job will pause in the FAIL_ABORT state.  Then we can release the committer from the barrier and verify the job proceeds to failed.

, Trivial fix that drops the assert. Ran the test multiple times and haven't seen it fail - I know that doesn't say much.

[~jlowe], in this particular case, given the purpose of the test is to verify we eventually get to the FAILED state, I went ahead with the simpler approach. , +1, LGTM. I ran the test 3 times and haven't seen it fail., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., +1, lgtm.  It's a reasonable approach.

The test failure is unrelated and most likely caused by something like YARN-1183.  I tested the patch locally and it does not fail.  I'll commit this shortly., Thanks for the contribution, Karthik, and thanks for the review Akira!
