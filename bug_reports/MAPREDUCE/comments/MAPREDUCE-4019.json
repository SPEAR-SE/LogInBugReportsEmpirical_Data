Patch mostly looks good to me except few minor nits/doubts on the patch.

- Can we show the states as MAP, REDUCE in the usage info instead of having taskTypes map(likewise before mrv2 changes)?
- As of now there is no support for JOB_SETUP, JOB_CLEANUP. Do we need to display these also?, Thanks for your review Devaraj.

bq.Can we show the states as MAP, REDUCE in the usage info instead of having taskTypes map(likewise before mrv2 changes)?  
    As previously we have taskTypes as map and reduce, So I kept the same. 
    Do we also need to show the states as MAP and REDUCE? Based on your suggestion, I will change the patch.  

bq.As of now there is no support for JOB_SETUP, JOB_CLEANUP. Do we need to display these also?
    Yes, I think we no need to display these two. I will remove them in the next patch.
    
, I would suggest to have the task types are MAP and REDUCE instead of having as map, reduce and again getting from the taskTypes map., And also can you add some tests to demonstrate the issue., I have updated the patch with test case., +1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., This isn't a blocker for any release.

The issue is that you needed to specify "JOB_ID MAP running" instead of lower-case "map". We can improve this by making the enum check case-insensitive., Hi,
I wanted to help move this patch. I've made changes to remove JOB_SETUP,JOB_CLEANUP options. I've added code to validate task-type options at the beginning(CLI.run()) rather than passing it to other classes which would throw an exception somewhere down the call hierarchy(current implementation). I've also made the options for --list-attempt-ids case insensitive, so options 'map','reduce' will work. I've added couple of unit tests to test all these changes.Please note that I've reused some of the code from the previous patch contributed by B.Kumar., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks for picking up the torch on this, Ashwin.  Couple of comments:

* Whitespace was removed before/after a number of methods which would be nice to have back to match the style of the rest of the code
* getCluster should be named something like createCluster to indicate it is creating a new object each time it's called
* getTaskTypes() can simply be StringUtils.join(taskTypes, " "), Thanks Jason, patch updated. I forgot to mention this before,this patch doesn't apply to branch-23 .

, +1 for the 0.23 patch which will also apply to branch-2.
