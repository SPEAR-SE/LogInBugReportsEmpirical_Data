[In HADOOP-5726, we removed code related to pre-emption in an effort to simplify development of the capacity scheduler.

So, I suppose this issue is no longer applicable to the branch / trunk., Cancelling patch as it is both malformed (should not be absolute) and does not apply to any active branch.
