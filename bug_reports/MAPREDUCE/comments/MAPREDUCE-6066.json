[I will take a look., Can you post the job-configuration as well as the AM logs? Tx., Attached the job conf. Unfortunately the AM logs already got deleted (no log aggregation on this cluster). If it happens again I'll grab the AM logs., We also see this with Hadoop 2.6.0 using Capacity scheduler:
From job conf:
yarn.resourcemanager.scheduler.class = org.apache.hadoop.yarn.server.resourcemanager.scheduler.capacity.CapacityScheduler

Relevant section from the AM logs:

, This problem is interesting. I believe there are already many solutions from academic publications for this problem. Another corner case that we need to be careful is the case that if AM only get containers from a single NM, then we should allow speculative tasks run on the same node. 

Categorizing node becomes very important. What is the reason that causes this task (map or reduce) slow. Then, we can make more reasonable decision.]
