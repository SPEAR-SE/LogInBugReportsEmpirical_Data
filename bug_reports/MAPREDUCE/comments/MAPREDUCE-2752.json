[+1 patch looks good.
I have to manually fix dependency file to work around screwed up ivy-0.22.0-SNAPSHOT.xml (thanks Konstantin for pointing out about HDFS-2189 side effects).

ant compile-test doesn't work for contrib but it doesn't work with or without the patch: it seems broken nonetheless.

I'll commit it shortly., I have just committed it. Thanks Joep., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #62 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/62/])
    MAPREDUCE-2752. Build does not pass along properties to contrib builds. Contribured by Joep Rottinghuis.
