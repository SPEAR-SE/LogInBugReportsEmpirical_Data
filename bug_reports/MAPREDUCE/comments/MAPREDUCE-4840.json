[Patch attached. Disclaimer: the code compiles fine, but I didn't fully test it since I wrote this on a Windows box and trunk isn't really good with Windows these days., I agree. Would you be willing to provide a patch that deprecates this set of code?, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12555682/MAPREDUCE-4840.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:green}+1 @author{color}.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    {color:green}+1 tests included{color}.  The patch appears to include 1 new or modified test files.

      {color:red}-1 javac{color}.  The applied patch generated 2035 javac compiler warnings (more than the trunk's current 2013 warnings).

    {color:green}+1 javadoc{color}.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    {color:green}+1 eclipse:eclipse{color}.  The patch built with eclipse:eclipse.

    {color:red}-1 findbugs{color}.  The patch appears to introduce 1 new Findbugs (version 1.3.9) warnings.

    {color:green}+1 release audit{color}.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of release audit warnings.

    {color:green}+1 core tests{color}.  The patch passed unit tests in hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient.

    {color:green}+1 contrib tests{color}.  The patch passed contrib unit tests.

I actually got a bit confused earlier.

# The Skipping feature does work with the Old API presently, correct? Have you observed otherwise? MAPREDUCE-1932 was for supporting it in New API.
# The idea is to deprecate the feature, cause it won't be added to the new API and the concept is to be unsupported, in favor of user-end logic. The patch removes it directly without giving a deprecation first., Ah OK looks like I was the one confused. I don't believe it works, though as mentioned above I can't really test because of unrelated Windows problems. There's this code in TaskAttemptListenerImpl though:

{code}
  @Override
  public void reportNextRecordRange(TaskAttemptID taskAttemptID, Range range)
      throws IOException {
    // This is used when the feature of skipping records is enabled.

    // This call exists as a hadoop mapreduce legacy wherein all changes in
    // counters/progress/phase/output-size are reported through statusUpdate()
    // call but not the next record range information.
    throw new IOException("Not yet implemented.");
  }
{code}

So I guess the right thing to do is fix the implementation? Not sure if there's a JIRA tracking that., Note that the test for it (TestBadRecords) was disabled in MAPREDUCE-3582, \\
