, One minor related thing I see when running this test is some untracked files showing up in git. Probably a separate JIRA might be needed.

, +1 patch looks good and fixes the test on my box., Pushed the latest patch to trunk and branch-0.23. Closing this. Sorry for the trouble.

Thanks Jonathan for the verification. Also, please open a separate ticket for the above issue. Thanks!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit #83 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Commit/83/])
