, I'm going to close this as won't fix.  In practice, this doesn't really cause anything to break, because even on Windows, the container launch script explicitly sets a value for the {{PWD}} environment variable.  Even though this environment variable name is more of a Unix-like convention, there isn't a compelling reason to make a change.]
