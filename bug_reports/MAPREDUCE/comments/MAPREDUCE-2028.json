[Actually, what should probably happen is that MultiFileWordCount's "MyInputFormat" and "MultiLineRecordRecord" should get promoted out of examples and officially into the mapred(uce) APIs. 

The following appears to implement exactly what us streaming users want/need:

$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop  \
        jar \
        `ls $HADOOP_HOME/contrib/streaming/hadoop-*-streaming.jar` \
        -libjars `ls $HADOOP_HOME/hadoop-*-examples.jar` \
        -inputformat org.apache.hadoop.examples.MultiFileWordCount\$MyInputFormat \
        -inputreader org.apache.hadoop.examples.MultiFileWordCount\$MultiFileLineRecordReader \
        ....
, core devs don't use streaming so this won't get fixed.]
