This message is automatically generated., Thanks Robert. The patch looks good, the tests in particular. I am surprised these changes didn't result in other changes due to calls to the methods whose signature the patch modifies. Given Jenkins doesn't complain, it should be okay. Do you want to double-check just in case.
, I just ran all of the tests under {{hadoop-mapreduce-project}} successfully.  

I also just checked where those two methods are used and there's no issues because:
1) Whenever {{checkOutputSpecs}} is used, the code handles an {{IOException}} instead of either of the two types of {{FileAlreadyExistsException}}, and both types of {{FileAlreadyExistsException}} inherit from {{IOException}}
2) Whenever {{setOutputPath}} is used, there's always other method calls that can throw {{IOException}}s anyway, Thanks for taking a closer look, Robert. 

+1, While the patch looks good, we may have introduced a behavioral change in the {{setOutputPath()}} method.

In Hadoop 1, {{setOutputPath()}} sets whatever path it is received in the conf, without any modification.

In Hadoop 2, {{setOutputPath()}} makeQualified-s the received path and then sets it in the conf.

This means that in Hadoop 1 a relative path will always resolved to the homedir while in Hadoop 2 a relative path will be resolved to the working dir (by default set to the homedir).

Can we please verify this hypothesis? This could be done by having a simple MR job where in the submission we set (or not) the workingdirectory in the FS, and use a relative path for the output dir. Then run the job once setting workingdir to /tmp, once not setting it at all. Run this in Hadoop 1 and in Hadoop 2. Find out where the job output ends in all cases. If different, we need to decide if we want to revert to Hadoop 1 behavior or not.
, I created a job like you said and ran it on Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2 with and without setting the working dir.  The behavior is the same in both Hadoop 1 and Hadoop 2: without setting the working dir, it resolves a relative path to the homedir; with setting the working dir, it resolves a relative path to that dir (even in Hadoop 1).  So no behavioral change here :), Thanks for verifying this Robert.

+1, Thanks Robert. Committed to trunk and branch-2., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #3629 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/3629/])
