[[~rohithsharma] - Thanks for reporting this. I'm currently not able to recreate this issue on trunk, but maybe it is configuration related.

I did see similar classpath related issues with the original patch in YARN-7677, but not with the reworked patch. Do you maybe have the old patch applied? does reverting that commit fix the issue?, I don't have any patch applied in my cluster. I always build from trunk and deploy every time freshly. Last time I deployed is last week, it was working. Immediately started failing with this exception. Let me deploy manually again and test it., I verified in trunk deploying manually and seeing this error. It appears something gone wrong in recent commits, I reverted YARN-7677 patch with commit id 8013475d447a8377b5aed858208bf8b91dd32366 and worked fine. , Updated [^conf.zip] and [^app-logs.zip] which failed vs passed. The same conf is being used for both. app-logs.zip contains launch_container.sh and other details as well. That would help to compare both and analyze!, Thanks [~rohithsharma] for reporting this issue, I can reproduce the same issue with Rohith's config on latest trunk. And the problem doesn't exist after revert YARN-7677. 

[~jlowe], [~ebadger], can we revert YARN-7677? , Closing this JIRA as Resolved since YARN-7677 is reverted.]
