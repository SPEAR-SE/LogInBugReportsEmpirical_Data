This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good, but I think I would prefer to see the default be the task start time from task info.  This is what the AM reports for tasks with no task attempts. , I would disagree with you there Bobby! If I'm on the task page, as a user, I don't want to have to figure out that a task attempt was never launched by matching with the job start time. I want to see unequivocally in readily apparent letters "N/A" like the great Ravi meant for me to see, so that I know that task attempts were never launched.

I suggest changing the AM to do the same. I'll upload a patch for that., Allow me to recant what I said! In the AM, when the task startup time is the same as the job startup time, the status says "Scheduled". So its indicative that it has been "Scheduled" at (that job) startup time. However, in a JHS, the task has already either finished, or failed/killed. In case the task attempt was never launched, I want to see N/A. If an attempt was launched (but failed), I want to see the start time of the first attempt.

Can we please commit the patch as is? , I am fine with that for the UI, showing an N/A triggered by the -1, but the web services are returning that value too. We either need to update the documentation to indicate what a -1 means or switch it to do what the AM does.

Sorry it has taken me so long to respond., Thanks for pointing that out Bobby! I had no idea that even existed! :), {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
