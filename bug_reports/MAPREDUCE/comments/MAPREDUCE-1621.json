This message is automatically generated., Many tests failed because of NoClassDefFoundError. Re-submitting to hudson, Seems hudson is not picking up submitted patches, I ran  test-patch and ant test on my machine. All tests passed except the known failures in trunk (MAPREDUCE-1834 and MAPREDUCE-1925)., Patch looks good.
+1, I just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
