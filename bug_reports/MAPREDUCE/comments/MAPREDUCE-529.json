[The refactoring work in HADOOP-4980 fixes this problem. While  I realize that we don't usually want to clump together more than one fix in a patch, the work in HADOOP-4980 went a long long way in simplifying the fix for this patch, so I didn't create a separate patch here. By making the _SchedulingInfo_ class be functionally 'outside' the scheduler class, and thus unaware of the latter's data structures, and by moving the generation of the display strings to the concerned _QueueSchedulingInfo_ and _TaskSchedulingInfo_ objects, the synchronization problem is easily addressed. we also don't update the QSI objects, preferring to show potentially slightly stale information, but without a performance penalty. , Resolving fixed per previous comment (via HADOOP-6980 patch).

Please reopen and update if necessary., Sorry, that should have said fixed via HADOOP-4980, not 6980.]
