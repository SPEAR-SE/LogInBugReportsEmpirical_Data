, Build is probably still failing due to HDFS-2315, but I cannot confirm right now due to connectivity problems to Jenkins server:

Proxy Error
The proxy server received an invalid response from an upstream server.
The proxy server could not handle the request GET /job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/68/.

Reason: Error reading from remote server
