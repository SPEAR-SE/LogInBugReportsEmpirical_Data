This message is automatically generated., +1, lgtm.  The test build failures are unrelated, and the test passes locally for me.

There's obviously some runaway processes on the build machines from prior test runs, probably from things like TestUberAM timing out and leaking MRAppMaster processes with tons of launcher threads.  However I don't have access to said machines to verify that theory and clean them up.

I'll commit this shortly., Thanks, Robert!  I committed this to trunk, branch-2, and branch-2.2., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #4667 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/4667/])
