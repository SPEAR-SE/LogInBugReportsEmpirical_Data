Also, add a 'isDebugEnabled' check..., @Arun! Done. Please review and commit. I ran , I meant to write "I ran 
bq. $ mvn clean install -Pdist -Dtar -Ptest-patch -DskipTests
successfully"
Not sure if that is the right way to test-patch anymore :(, @Arun : I've made the change you required. Can you please commit this?, Removing messages from LeafQueue and CapacityScheduler too. 

There are constant heartbeat LOG messages like
