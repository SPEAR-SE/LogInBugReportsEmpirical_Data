[If HADOOP_OPTS is viewed as a dictionary for sharing key/value pairs among Hadoop processes, then it seems that "hadoop.log.dir" should not be in HADOOP_OPTS.  Either:
* all processes can continue to use the name "hadoop.log.dir" for this parameter, but not share it through HADOOP_OPTS.  Instead, sets of processes that need to share this value can share it through some other mechanism, perhaps a <PROCESS_SET_X>_SHARED_LOG parameter list, where each such process set have a differently named list; or
* each set of processes that CAN share a value for log location should have its own name for the log location parameter, such as "hadoop.log.dir" and "tasktracker.log.dir".  Then all (or none) of these parameters could be shared in HADOOP_OPTS.
, In previous release of HADOOP, we don't have this problem because we are always reconstructing HADOOP_OPTS from scratch in the invoking process.  hadoop.log.dir is setup by the parent process to ensure the output are redirected properly to the desired location.  This change was done as part of request from HCatalog to have ability to override the HADOOP_OPTS.  HCatalog's request may be supported by changing HADOOP_OPTS overrides to HADOOP_USER_OPTS, and make HADOOP_USER_OPTS as the prefix of HADOOP_OPTS.

In streaming job, we should unset HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER environment variable to ensure hadoop command invoked in streaming job is output to console which gets redirected to TaskLogAppender by the task attempt., Patch for brach-20-security., Same patch for trunk., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., There is no need of HADOOP_USER_OPTS because HADOOP_CLIENT_OPS already exists.  The patch is modified to have client ops be part of HADOOP_OPTS in the template., Make sure HADOOP_OPTS contains HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS in case Hadoop command is executed inside streaming job.  TaskLogAppender is streamed to the user log file., +1, Updated configuration to have HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS override., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
