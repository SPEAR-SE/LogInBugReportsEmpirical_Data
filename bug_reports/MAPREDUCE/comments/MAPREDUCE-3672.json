This message is automatically generated., Have you tested this on a cluster? , Hey Anupam,

Can you update it so we get the pretty formatted version from the cli for the new NUM_KILLED fields?  It is in: hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-core/src/main/resources/org/apache/hadoop/mapreduce/JobCounter.properties

From cli output right now has:

        Job Counters
                NUM_KILLED_MAPS=1
                NUM_KILLED_REDUCES=1
                Launched map tasks=1
                Launched reduce tasks=1

It would be nice to display Killed map tasks=X, Killed reduce tasks=Y


, Thanks! Updated patch to pretty the output. Tested on a single node cluster locally., Sorry -wrong file!, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
