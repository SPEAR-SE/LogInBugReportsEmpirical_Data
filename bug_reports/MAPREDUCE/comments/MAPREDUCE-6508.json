[Attaching a patch to remove test for delegation token (and dead code).
First I thought setting kerberos authentication fixes the problem, however, when I set kerberos authentication, the MiniMRClientCluster didn't start. In addition, the delegation for RM is tested by TestRMDelegationTokens and TestTokenClientRMService classes. Therefore I decided to remove the test code., 01:

This message was automatically generated., Hi [~ajisakaa], Thanks for the patch. However, do we figure out the reason why job get failed intermittently? May be we should try to fix/understand the test problem rather than remove the test code?, bq. However, do we figure out the reason why job get failed intermittently?
After YARN-4126, RM does not return delegation token when it's in insecure mode. That's why the following test code fails
{code:title=TestNetworkedJob#testNetworkedJob}
      // test token
      Token<DelegationTokenIdentifier> token = client
          .getDelegationToken(new Text(UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser()
              .getShortUserName()));
{code}, Thanks for your reply, [~ajisakaa]! I agree it is right to remove that code in unit test which make test failed consistently. The JIRA title "intermittently" is a little misleading, and I will correct it soon.
Latest patch (01) LGTM. +1. I will commit it shortly.
, I have commit latest patch to trunk and branch-2. Thanks [~ajisakaa] for delivering the patch!, FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #8696 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/8696/])

, I suggest reopening this issue.

The test fails on both of my local machine  (@6702e7d66a4949a40bcdbd9f51ca1e746c8991e1, Jan 7 2016) and on Jenkins:

Also, the error message is wrong: HADOOP-12693
, The failure of TestNetworkedJob was fixed by MAPREDUCE-6508, but after MAPREDUCE-6508, YARN-3946 broke the test again.

This test failure is reported by MAPREDUCE-6579, and the patch in the issue will also fix the order of the arguments for assertEquals method. I'll close this issue., OK, and thank you., Hi [~ajisakaa], 
As i understand YARN-3946 broke it once, dint get what you meant by {{but after MAPREDUCE-6508, YARN-3946 broke the test again}}. Am i missing something ?, Hi [~Naganarasimha], 

bq. but after MAPREDUCE-6508, YARN-3946 broke the test again.
"again" is misleading. I'm sorry about that. The following is correct.

YARN-4126 broke TestNetworkedJob and the test was fixed by MAPREDUCE-6508. After MAPREDUCE-6508, YARN-3946 broke the test. I've uploaded the patch to fix the test in MAPREDUCE-6579., Ohh ok got the hierarchy ! thanks for the clarification :)]
