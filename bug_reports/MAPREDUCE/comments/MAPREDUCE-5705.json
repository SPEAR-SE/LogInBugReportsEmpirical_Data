[Output buffer is implemented using a single byte array kvbuffer.  Java Language Spec defines arrays as being accessed using [non-negative integer index values|http://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jls/se7/html/jls-10.html], Hence Integer.MAX_VALUE , 2^31 - 1 is the max size. In order to work with a larger buffer, one would either need a multi-array structure or use a wider primitive type like long with special encoding. , What Gera said. Also, please see MAPREDUCE-4866. Marking this one as a Duplicate and closing out., Correction: Right JIRA for map side limitation is MAPREDUCE-2308., MAPREDUCE-2308 is a very old JIRA for MRv1 age. Let's reopen this and fix it in 2.x., Isn't this a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-5028? ]
