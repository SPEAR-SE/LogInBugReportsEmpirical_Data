[Somehow Avro 1.2.0 is still on the CLASSPATH, causing the above error (SpecificData.java:48).

http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/hadoop/avro/tags/release-1.2.0/src/java/org/apache/avro/specific/SpecificData.java?view=annotate#l48

The log several times states that 1.2.0 (still referenced by common) is evicted by 1.3.0, but perhaps this is not done consistently?

org.apache.hadoop#avro;1.2.0 by [org.apache.hadoop#avro;1.3.0] in [common]

HADOOP-6486, which upgrades common to Avro 1.3.0 is ready-to-commit, but I wanted to commit it at the same time as MAPREDUCE-1556, as otherwise things will be broken.  What should I do?
, This was fixed with the commit of MAPREDUCE-1556., Reopening for setting proper resolution status.]
