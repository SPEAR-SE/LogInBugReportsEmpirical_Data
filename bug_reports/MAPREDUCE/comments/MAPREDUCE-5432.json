This message is automatically generated., A few minor comments:

+      printAttributes("CLOCK_SPLIT", clockSplits);
+      printAttributes("CPU_USAGE", cpuUsages);
Maybe print it as "CLOCK_SPLITS" AND "CPU_USAGES" so that it is consistent with the naming of the attribute?


for the following function: 
+    void printAttributes(String tag, int[] attributes) {
+      for (int i=0;i<attributes.length;i++) {
+        System.out.println(tag + "[" + i + "]:" + attributes[i]);
+     }
+    }

I believe it would print it as: 
CLOCK_SPLIT[0]: 8691
CLOCK_SPLIT[1]: 129
CLOCK_SPLIT[2]: 128
CLOCK_SPLIT[3]: 129
CLOCK_SPLIT[4]: 128
... etc

Would it be slightly better to print it as: 
"clockSplits":[8691,129,128,129,128,129,128,129,128,129,128,129]
"cpuUsages":[28,28,29,28,28,29,28,28,29,28,28,29]


, [~vrushalic]:Thanks for your reviewing. I updated patch based on your comments. Additionally, I added null check before call printAttributes because it's also done before printing counters' values., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
