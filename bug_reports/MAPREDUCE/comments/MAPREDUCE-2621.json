, Looks good to me, and I verified the tests pass for me.  A minor comment: the new getJobTracker method (in UtilsForTests.java) duplicates almost all of the code in the original getJobTracker method.  It would be more maintainable if we could consolidate the duplicated code so we don't have to make future changes in both places - not critical though., Consolidated getJobTracker method., -1 overall.
