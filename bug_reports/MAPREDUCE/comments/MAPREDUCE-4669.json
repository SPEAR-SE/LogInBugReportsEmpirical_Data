[An approach would be do get the user to provide the keystore for its AM via distributed cached., Hi [~tucu00] - Do you have any idea of the status of this issue? Thanks!, See this comment in YARN-8448 and the design doc in YARN-6586 for more background on the patch. This patch (MAPREDUCE-4669.001.patch) contains the MR changes that rely on YARN-8448.001.patch.

Some notes on the patch:
 - The {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.enabled}} property controls if the MR AM should try to use the Yarn-provided keystore (when set to {{true}}); this will also cause it to provide an HTTPS tracking URL to the RM. It defaults to {{false}}.
 - The {{yarn.app.mapreduce.am.webapp.https.client.auth}} property controls if the MR AM should require client authentication (when set to {{true}}). It defaults to {{false}}. In this case, the MR AM is the server and the RM is the client, so this requires that the RM present its certificate to the AM when it connects to the AM - the AM can then verify this certificate with the Yarn-provided truststore.
 - It won't compile without the YARN-8448 patch.]
