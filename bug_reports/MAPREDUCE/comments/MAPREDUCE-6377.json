[Hi [~bibinchundatt], thanks for reporting this issue.
I can work on this issue. It looks like the change in MAPREDUCE-5052 caused this issue.
In [MAPREDUCE-5052|https://github.com/apache/hadoop/commit/ee5351bf22e113d39db3839432bc7d6c743cc736], "Submit Time" is added at the first column and all columns should be shifted by one. But {{HsView#jobsTableInit}} is not changed to match the new layout.
{code}
  private String jobsTableInit() {
    return tableInit().
        append(", 'aaData': jobsTableData").
        append(", bDeferRender: true").
        append(", bProcessing: true").

        // Sort by id upon page load
        append(", aaSorting: [[2, 'desc']]").
        append(", aoColumnDefs:[").
        // Maps Total, Maps Completed, Reduces Total and Reduces Completed
        append("{'sType':'numeric', 'bSearchable': false, 'aTargets': [ 7, 8, 9, 10 ] }").
        append("]}").
        toString();
  }
{code}
Based on the above code, you can see column "State" which is 7 now is mistakenly considered as column "Maps Total"., [~zxu] thnks a lot for taking up the issue. Its all yours.
Hoping to get patch soon . , thanks [~bibinchundatt]!
I uploaded a patch MAPREDUCE-6377.000.patch for review.
I attached two documents to prove the jobs can be sorted on state column with this patch., \\
