bq. If we kill one of reducers, then also the map cannot be launched as the priority of Failed map is lesser than that of reducer. So the remaining reducer only will get allocated from RM side. This is causing a hang for in reducer side. 
This isn't correctly interpreted. I can understand it being not straight-forward, but lower numbered priority of failed map actually means it is of higher priority w.r.t scheduling.

You may have been seeing something else. If you think this is a stale issue, please close this as invalid. Thanks., Yes Vinod.

I am marking this as invalid. I checked a similar scenario, and i could see map task is getting re-launched.

However, I will check more detail., And if its reoccurring, i ll reopen.]
