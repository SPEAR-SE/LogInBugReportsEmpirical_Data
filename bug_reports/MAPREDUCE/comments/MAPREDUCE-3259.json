[The attached patch is for trunk, but should also apply to branch-0.23.

Although the client-side environment may be set by users or by the admin, the framework including what may be needed by the hadoop code base in java.library.path seems more reasonable. After all libhadoop.so may be required to run things even if users don't explicitly use any features that directly depend on it. 

Since meaningful tests need specific environment setup and the optional native build, no automated test was added. The risk of this change should be minimal. 

Manual testing was carried out as follows.
- Enable JniBasedUnixUserGroupsMapping.
- Build without patch.
- Test failures observed in node manager and job client.
- Apply patch and rebuild.
- Without the library, many tests in node manager and job client failed.
- Installed the library.
- All tests pass.

The findbugs warnings don't seem to be new. Even the ones in the NM and the client app have nothing to do with this patch., Reattaching the same patch with license granted, with the name change for the friendlier mine-type., Kihwal, won't it suffice to have the right configs (and defaults) for admin.env?, bq. Kihwal, won't it suffice to have the right configs (and defaults) for admin.env?
For executing the task script, that's true.  For LTC directly launching JVM to run localizer, either LD_LIBRARY_PATH or -Djava.library.path is need to be set properly. It will appear to work until something requiring the native lib is enabled. When I enabled the JNI-based user groups mapping feature, the localizer wouldn't run.

Back to running task script. The task jvm may have to load libhadoop.so because of a certain cluster-level config. I think we should treat it as an app-level dependency, rather than a run-time dependency of specific client code. Sometimes even admins won't know whether the library will be required by enabling a feature. I thought it will be simpler to add java.library.path to take care of the dependency at the app-level.

, Kihwal, sorry if I wasn't clear.

If the admins set mapreduce.admin.user.env such that LD_LIBRARY_PATH includes paths for libhadoop.so and JNI-based user-groups mapping, what goes wrong?

mapreduce.admin.user.env is for cluster-level configs (libhadoop, user-groups mapping etc.) and app-specific deps can go in mapreduce.(map,reduce).env. What am I missing here?, Sorry, my explanation is rather wrong and confusing. I shouldn't have said app-level. That's totally wrong. 

Apps are fine as you said. It's about yarn system level env. When a JVM is directly launched by the LTC, neither of LD_LIBRARY_PATH or java.library.path is set. This is the case for ContainerLocalizer. It will fail to load libhadoop.so if it needs it. If the library is installed in one of the directories ld looks at, it will work without the setting. Or the hadoop lib path may be added to /etc/ld.so.conf or /etc/ld.so.conf.d.  Is it still confusing?  Or am I totally wrong about this? 

I can leave out the second part in the patch for the client since a proper env can be placed in the container script using the facility you mentioned. Only thing I don't like is the default, which assumes the old dir layout.  I could try changing the default so that it has a better chance of working right out of the box, but that's not critical.
, Ok, the talk about apps confused me. Now I see the real issue: ContainerLocalizer needs this set for UGI etc.

We shouldn't change MapReduceChildJVM, the changes to LCE.startLocalizer seem fine., The new patch contains only the necessary change pertaining to LinuxContainerExecutor#startLocalizer. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
