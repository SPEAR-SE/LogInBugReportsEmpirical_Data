[Currently in trunk and .21 of hadoop, we have removed all the {{MiniMRCluster}} test to a new test case and {{TestQueueManager}} is plain unit test. All the integration tests have been moved to {{TestQueueManagerWithJobTracker}} which has only 3 test cases and all of the same runs under a minute even. Currently in latest build the same took only 30 seconds.

This was done as part of MAPREDUCE-28.

Isn't solution at MAPREDUCE-28 sufficient?, I agree it is fixed by MAPREDUCE-28. Resolving as duplicate
Dick, please re-open if you don't think so., I agree.]
