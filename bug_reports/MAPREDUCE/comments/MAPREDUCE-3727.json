[One possible solution would be the JobClient to remove this property before submitting the job., still investigating if this affects trunk or not, code change significantly., This happens on trunk also. Clearly there is a TODO in the code which says the current place is inappropriate for reading the tokens file.

If this code gets triggered, it is not just the reading of token file that will fail. Whenever this happens (don't know by what trigger), the client will try to obtain delegation tokens from the NameNode which will also fail? Have any clue why that isn't happening?

bq. One possible solution would be the JobClient to remove this property before submitting the job.
I guess you mean as part of the individual Oozie actions. Right?

The alternative could be to not fail with exception when it cannot read the file, but instead just log an error and continue. Not sure whether that's a good fix though., Vinod, thanks for confirming this is an issue in trunk as well.

It is not possible to do it at Oozie level, the property is used within the scope of the hadoop submission code (by TokenCache, ie, computing splits), hadoop submission code should remove this property from the jobconf before writing the jobconf to hdfs.

I guess a warn and continue would work too. but it would be quite confusing to get a warning for a file from some other jobtoken file.

I think we should remove on submission (as I state before) as that property (current value) is meaningful only in the context the the current submission. If somebody is doing a submission from the submitted job (like Oozie), then they should start the whole cycle again (getting the ENV var and setting the property again in the context of the submitted job)., +1 looks good to me., -1 overall.
