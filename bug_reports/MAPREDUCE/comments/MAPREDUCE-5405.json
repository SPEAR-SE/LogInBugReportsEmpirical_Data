[This is most easily repro'd as an intermittent failure in {{TestRecoveryManager}}.  It fails more frequently for me on Windows, but it's a problem on any platform., I'm attaching a patch that does the following:
# If the symlink exists before creating it, try to delete it.
# Clean up numerous file handle leaks in the test suite.
# Use unique job output directories in the test suite.
# Fix race condition around validating job cleanup (which runs asynchronously) in the test suite.
With this patch, {{TestRecoveryManager}} passes consistently for me on both Mac and Windows., Sounds good to me! I also did some tests on Ubuntu and Windows. It passes consistently. Thanks Chris. , +1 lgtm., Thanks, Arun.  I have committed this to branch-1 and branch-1-win.]
