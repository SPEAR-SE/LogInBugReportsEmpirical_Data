[I verified source code of distcp. Distcp should have set mapred.map.tasks to 10 only. As hadoop need not obey user-specified number of maps to be launched, you may be hitting the issue ?, I am not sure if it uses N line input format, in which case N can be calculated based on the total number of files and required max number of mappers. ]
