[As part of my work for MAPREDUCE-3312 the equals method will be removed.  The equals method is here as a bit of a hack so that related events in a queue can be removed without having to write code to walk the queue themselves. , Sorry I guess I am wrong about that.  Yes the equals method for ContainerRemoteLaunchEvent is being abused, and I am fixing that in MAPREDUCE-3312, but ContainerRemoteLaunchEvent gets its equals method from its parent ContainerRemoteLaunchEvent which has both an equals and a hashCode in both 0.23 and trunk.  There must be something odd happening with Findbugs. , Strike that last comment.  I guess eclipse some how got confused and pointed me to the wrong file.  My first comment still stands.  As part of MAPREDUCE-3312 I will be fixing this issue because the need for the equals hack will not longer be needed.  I should upload a patch to MAPREDUCE-3312 shortly.]
