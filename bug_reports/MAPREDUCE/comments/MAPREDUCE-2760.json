, Why this property is jobtracker level property, when it can be changed for each job by setting required value in job config. , Abhishek,

Its a bug if the JT level property is not honored and is able to be replaced by a client sent conf. You can try to finalize the JT property to enforce it if it is so (only as a workaround).

In any case, to report bugs, please file a new JIRA rather than reopen closed older ones; thanks! :), No intensions to reopen it, just wanted to know that only this property name is corrected or there is some code modified to actually tie this property at JT level., Raised MAPREDUCE-5106 jira mentioning that this property is honoured at job level as well.]
