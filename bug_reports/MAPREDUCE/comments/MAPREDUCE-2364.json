[We encounter the same problem, when TaskTracker download & unJar a very big job.jar in localizeJob(), it stops sending heartbeat and web service hangs too. 
Our solution for this issue is to add a new lock in RunningJob class called localizing. Instead of holding the whole rjob lock, rjob.localizing is locked., trunk patch, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., I think this issue is the same with MAPREDUCE-2209., Hi Devraj,
MAPREDUCE-2209 also resolves the same issue. MAPREDUCE-2209 targets to solve one more thread blocking.
Request you to look into MAPREDUCE-2209 patch. The patch provided in the issue is for 0.23 version.
, Subroto, I see a significant difference in the patches attached to MAPREDUCE-2209 and the last one here. I'll need to look at the details but if you have time could you please take a look at the patch attached here and see if this makes sense (given this patch predates the patch on MAPREDUCE-2209; I am sorry that I didn't look at the patch here earlier). , Hadoop 0.20.204.0 was just released.]
