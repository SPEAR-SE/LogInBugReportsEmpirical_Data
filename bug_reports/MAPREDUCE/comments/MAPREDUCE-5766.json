This message is automatically generated., I understand the desire to move ping requests and JVM asking for task messages to debug, but do we really want to move status updates to debug?  They are particularly useful for debugging why a particular task didn't speculate (a common ask from our users) as those messages report the progress of the task.  It's also useful to verify the last time the AM saw a progress report from a task when the task expiry timeout gets triggered., Thanks Jason for the comment, the intention was because there is already a LOG.info(""Progress of TaskAttempt ...") immediately following the log "Status update from... ".   New patch merged these two logging, let me know if that looks OK. , The message {{"JVM with ID : " + jvmId + " asked for a task"}} is also useful, we should retain it., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

Oh, sorry, my apologies.  I missed the fact that we were already redundantly reporting task status receipt further down.  In that case I think we should just remove the log message of status receipt entirely and just leave the existing progress report.  The status message adds no new value, even as a DEBUG message, as it only reports the task attempt ID which is already logged by the progress message a few lines later.  The progress message implies status receipt., Uploaded a new patch as suggested by Jason and Vinod, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The latest patch looks good. +1. Jian, it looks like we need a completely different patch for branch-2. Can you please look at that too?, the ping is used to report child's aliveness to the parent, if no status progress available. trunk and branch-2  has diverged the implementation.
