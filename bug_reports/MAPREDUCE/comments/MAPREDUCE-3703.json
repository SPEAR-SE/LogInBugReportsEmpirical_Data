[Would it be better to just provide a count of nodes in the jmx output and have additional webservice apis ( with appropriate filter/pagination params to reduce the size of returned data ) for querying the  RM for all the active/unhealthy/rebooted/... nodes? 

I am aware that the jobtracker does emit this information today but on a large cluster, the amount of data being sent back in the json output could be potentially huge ( and a performance issue if any rogue layer pings the jmx servlet too many times)?, @Hitesh,

The timing and size did not seem unreasonable during my tests in a 0.20.205 security cluster with a large number of nodes (~4000 nodes).

Size: ~800000 Megabytes
Avg time after 10 accesses to the JMX service (using wget to access the jmx service):
real: 0m0.1016s
sys:  0m0.0050s
user: 0m0.0014s

Since the load seems reasonable, and since this service is provided in previous releases, I would like to provide it in 0.23 also.

{noformat}, @Eric, 1 MB worth of data being pulled may be an issue depending on where the call is being made from. If most of the use cases are from more or less within the same network/colo, then latency may not be that big a factor ( unless someone hits the jmx url too often ). In any case, if no one has mentioned anything with respect to the jmx data size for the 0.20 branch, I guess there is no harm in adding it also to .23. 

Minor comments on the json keys:
  - could you change UsedMemory and AvailableMemory to UsedMemoryMB and AvailableMemoryMB. 
  - Also, it would be good if the json output could be changed to have the keys match the elements used in the webservice apis.

This message is automatically generated., +1 lgtm!, Actually now that I think of it, we never had anything exposed via jmx for the RM? Looks like this is the first bean we are adding. Is that right? I thought some of the work that Thomas did on web services was also exposed via jmx. No? , Actually, there are several ResourceManager beans. I couldn't find any that test JMX specifically, though, so I added a test for this new one. The ResourceManager beans are accessible via http://<rm-host>:<port>/jmx and are as follows:

Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=UgiMetrics (login metrics)
Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=MetricsSystem,sub=Stats (sources/sinks/ops/time)
Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=QueueMetrics,q0=root,q1=<qname>
Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=RpcDetailedActivityForPort<port> (NumOps/AvgTime)
Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=ClusterMetrics (NumNodes, but not lists of nodes)
Hadoop:service=ResourceManager,name=RMNMInfo (NEW: contains list and status of live nodes)., @Eric,
 You are right. Reviewing the code now., Just committed this. Thanks a lot Eric!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1690 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1690/])
