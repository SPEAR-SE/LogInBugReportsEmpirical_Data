[Attaching patch, depends on MAPREDUCE-4443 to be committed first.

Thanks,
Mayank, I have tested the history server UI with sample jobs, not sure about the unit test case for web UI.

Thanks,
Mayank, Whats the status here? Any chance of getting this committed ?, It looks like this issue is fixed at MAPREDUCE-5875.
The following change in CompletedJob.java from MAPREDUCE-5875 will have the same effect as the patch in the issue
{code}
        final FileSystem fs = historyFileAbsolute.getFileSystem(conf);
        final Path jobConfPath = new Path(historyFileAbsolute.getParent(),
            JobHistoryUtils.getIntermediateConfFileName(jobId));
        final Configuration conf = new Configuration();
        try {
          conf.addResource(fs.open(jobConfPath), jobConfPath.toString());
          Limits.reset(conf);
        } catch (FileNotFoundException fnf) {
          if (LOG.isWarnEnabled()) {
            LOG.warn("Missing job conf in history", fnf);
          }
        }
{code}
So I think we can resolve this issue as duplicate with MAPREDUCE-5875.]
