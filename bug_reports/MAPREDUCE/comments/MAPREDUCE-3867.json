This message is automatically generated., patch touches hadoop-tools, test-patch does not work with it.

in my local setup i got ALL testcases running but TestDistributedShell, could not figure out yet what is the prob., Nailed the TestDistributedShell failure. It needed some special classpath setting and yarn-site.xml for the minicluster. Also this testcase was using Java assert instead Junit Assert, and when running from IDE the test was wrongly passing as the IDE does not have assertions on.

Now all tests using minicluster pass.

Though the patch won't apply because it is multiproject (mapreduce/tools)

For the reviewer, the steps to test it are:

* from trunk/ : mvn install -DskipTests -Dmaven.javadoc.skip=true
* from trunk/hadoop-mapreduce-project/ : mvn test -offline
* from trunk/hadoop-tools/ : mvn test -offline

, +1 I ran some of the tests and they worked fine. Can you post the results of running test-patch from the top-level please., test-patch report with no patch:
