This message is automatically generated., Stefan,

Could you instead make the LOG.info into a LOG.debug with a debug condition check block (like how other LOG.debugs are done)?, This patch came from a hackathon I helped out in Berlin.  I missed it when I got back; sorry about that.  I'm fine with removing the line entirely.  It smells like a debugging-through-printf line that should have been removed.  +1., The log message should never appear. The message is more of an assert.

Has this been seen?, I believe not, I think it was more of a code-read discovery., This isn't a problem, nor does the statement exist in 0.23+.]
