[Application killed/failed is different from Job killed/failed. If the job is killed/failed in AM, Application state would still be successful. Successful application means AM exited gracefully after doing the unregister.
If AM is crashed or forcefully killed, in that case history file is not consistent. So history server can't serve the requests.

Please feel free to reopen if you disagree., I also doubted this originally, but I missed the fact that for apps(not jobs) which are killed/failed, JobHistory is most likely garbled.

We still need to make sure that JobStatus fields like user, jobName, jobFile, trackingUrl etc are correct for these jobs whose corresponding apps got killed/failed.

Will update the title accordingly.]
