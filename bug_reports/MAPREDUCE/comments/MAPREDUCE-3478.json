[Thanks for opening this Andrew. I had run into this, but I wasnt planning on upgrading until sometime, so didnt open the jira ;)., This is test code so it would be acceptable to use reflection in the test to use ServerCnxnFactory (from 3.4.0) if it's available, otherwise fall back to NIOServerCnxn.Factory (pre-3.4.0). (Note that it's not an incompatible ZooKeeper change since NIOServerCnxn is not a part of its [published API|http://zookeeper.apache.org/doc/r3.4.0/api/index.html].) Alternatively, we could switch to 3.4.0., Mahadev - do we (zk) want to fix this with a 3.4.1 release or is this something that should be handled by MR? (this is not a public api but still, for mr/hbase and the like it might be good to address), @Pat,
 This should be handled by MR.  HBase does not use it. I am planning to upgrade to 3.4.1 directly and also add a dependency on the test jars (so that we can use the test wrappers here). That should clean this stuff out., Seems like we should modify MR2 to not depend on private ZK apis (or make that API non-private in ZK if it needs to be)., @mahadev - sounds good.
@eli - my thinking was that if this is something useful for downstream users (ie easier testing against zk) then we might want to address. but given comments we're good (no zk change)., bq. This should be handled by MR. HBase does not use it.

We fixed up for this same compilation problem when we moved HBase 0.92 to 3.4.0., Here's a patch that upgrades to ZooKeeper 3.4.0., +1  lgtm, Tom,
 Any reason we want to upgrade right now? I'd say we can wait until 3.4.1., My motivation for upgrading now is to allow Hadoop 0.23 and HBase 0.92 to use the same version of ZooKeeper. Does that sound reasonable?, I can understand. I was expecting to do some performance testing with a complete RM restart solution soon. With 3.4.0 I might end up debugging both MRv2/ZK and thats why my hesitance to upgrade. But if it makes life easier for bigtop folks, I can bear the brunt of debugging both :)., +1 overall.

 Looks like 3.4.0 has data consistency issues. We'll be doing a 3.4.1 soon (as in should be available sometime next week). Want to wait for that?, Certainly - I was thinking the same thing., Updated to ZooKeeper 3.4.1., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
