[I have attached the surefire-report as log.txt, At first I divide the assertion to find the cause.
{code}
-    assertTrue("environment set for child is wrong", env.contains("INFO,CLA")
-               && env.contains("-Dyarn.app.container.log.dir=")
-               && env.contains("-Dyarn.app.container.log.filesize=" + logSize)
-               && env.contains("-Dlog4j.configuration="));
+    assertTrue("environment set for child should contain INFO,CLA",
+        env.contains("INFO,CLA"));
+    assertTrue(env.contains("-Dyarn.app.container.log.dir="));
+    assertTrue(env.contains("-Dyarn.app.container.log.filesize=" + logSize));
+    assertTrue(env.contains("-Dlog4j.configuration="));
{code}
The test fails at the following.
{code}
+    assertTrue("environment set for child should contain INFO,CLA",
+        env.contains("INFO,CLA"));
{code}, The test fails because {{echo $HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS}} returns nothing in Hadoop Streaming after MAPREDUCE-5806.
I suppose it is sufficient to confirm the environment variables by {{MRApp.cmdEnvironment}} instead of echo command., bq. {{MRApp.cmdEnvironment}}
My above comment was wrong, {{MyMRApp.cmdEnvironment}} in {{TestMapReduceChildJVM}} is the right.
Now I'm thinking the test can be removed because the environment variables are already tested in {{TestMapReduceChildJVM}}., Moved to MapReduce project, and attaching a patch to delete the test., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., bq. The test fails because echo $HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER $HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS returns nothing
I think this is wrong. May be MAPREDUCE-5806 is broken. [~vvasudev], can you please look at this?, This is expected behaviour. The test looks at two variables HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER and HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS. HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER is explicitly unset by StreamJob.java. MAPREDUCE-5806 stops setting log settings as part of HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS. If users wish to set HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS for the map tasks, they can set it via the AM settings.
I agree with [~ajisakaa] that we should remove the test., Thanks for the clarification, Varun! Checking in Akira's patch., Committed this to trunk, branch-2 and branch-2.4. Thanks Akira!, SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5428 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5428/])
