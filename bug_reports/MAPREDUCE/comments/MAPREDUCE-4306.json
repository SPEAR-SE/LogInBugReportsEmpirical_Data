[To reproduce this issue using the tarball on a single node cluster:

1- Start all the daemons using user1.
2- Switch to user2 and try to submit a distributed shell job:
{code}
bin/hadoop jar ./share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar org.apache.hadoop.yarn.applications.distributedshell.Client --jar ./share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-yarn-applications-distributedshell-3.0.0-SNAPSHOT.jar --shell_command ls --num_containers 1 --debug
{code}

I'll be uploading a patch momentarily., Here is the patch. I have manually tested it using a single-node cluster. Where I started the daemons using one user and then confirmed that a different user and the user started the daemons can both successfully run distributed shell jobs. , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., As I mentioned earlier, I have manually tested this issue and confirmed the corrected behavior with the patch., {noformat}
+    try {
+      amUser = cliParser.getOptionValue("user", UserGroupInformation
+          .getCurrentUser().getShortUserName());
+    } catch (IOException e) {
+      LOG.info("Getting current user info failed" + e.getMessage());
+    }
{noformat}

If a user has been specified on the command line then there is no need to find the current user. In fact, if the current user can't be found then {{amUser}} won't be set. (Also, there's a space missing in the info line.)

It's probably worth going through where user values are null or the empty string to check they are correct (e.g. on ContainerLaunchContext#setUser)., Thanks Tom for the review!

I have updated the patch to handle the case you highlighted (when the current user cannot be found and it is also not specified on the command line).

For the case of empty or null user, this will still be invalid, since the user name (picked from ContainerLaunchContext#setUser) is used by DefaultContainerExecutor.launchContainer(..) to construct the container directory. Basically the FileNotFoundException that was preventing the application from running was originating from line 126: lfs.mkdir(containerDir, null, false) because the parent directory was not correct, as it was using the wrong user in constructing the path.

This message is automatically generated., The "-user" option in general seems to be broken. Even after this patch, the AM will be localized as the original user - since the RM picks up the username from ugi.

Maybe we should remove the "-user" option completely? and use ApplicationConstants.Environment.USER in the AM - which is anyway set by the RM, based on the logged in user., Thanks Siddharth for the review!

I agree, I think it is  better to completely remove the "-user" option. I originally thought of just keeping it in case it can be used for testing or other purposes. But leaving it now may lead to confusion, and also setting it to something other than the original user will lead to failure as described above. 

Also reading ApplicationConstants.Environment.USER is simpler than reevaluating the username from ugi (which will give the same result after all). I have updated the patch accordingly. Thanks! , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
