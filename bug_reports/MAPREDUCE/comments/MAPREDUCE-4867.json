[I believe this is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-2129 which was fixed in 1.1.0., yes it is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-2129 (sorry I didn't find it)

The fix has been applied to branch-1 and branch-1.1, but not branch-1.0.
Merging r1358233 (from branch-1) in branch-1.0 should be enough.

Thanks, Adding Matt Foley who is the release manager for Hadoop 1.x.  He can comment on whether there are plans for another 1.0.x release and if MAPREDUCE-2129 would be a good candidate.]
