This message is automatically generated., in JobHistoryEventHandler, seems we already skip writing this event
{code}
        HistoryEvent historyEvent = event.getHistoryEvent();
        if (! (historyEvent instanceof NormalizedResourceEvent)) {
          mi.writeEvent(historyEvent);
        }
{code}, Thanks [~jianhe] for review and comments. 
Yes. But I cannot find other event that could cause this exception. May be somewhere else could write NormalizedResourceEvent as well? Anyway, I think the safe way to do is: handle NormalizedResourceEvent in JobBuilder but log a warn message to say that event should be ignored before. Also, I think we should improve the log to log the actual event that cannot be handled. 
Will deliver a quick update on patch soon., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
