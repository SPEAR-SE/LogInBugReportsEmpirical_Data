This message is automatically generated., The TestMRAppMaster NPE are related to MAPREDUCE-5805. This JIRA touches only YarnChild for Map/ReduceTask , The patch looks good to me. The only nit is to add the right job conf before Limits.init() so that Limits.init() can use the right job conf.

It's nearly the same fix, but how about 

{code}
final JobConf job = new JobConf(MRJobConfig.JOB_CONF_FILE);
Limits.init(job);
...
{code}, Agree w/ [~sjlee0]. 

[~jira.shegalov] - mind updating the patch? Tx., Thanks for catching this, [~sjlee0]. This makes sure that Limits and UGI are also properly configured.
