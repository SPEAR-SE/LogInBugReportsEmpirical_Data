This message is automatically generated., Should we consider using [DBCP|http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-dbcp]?, I don't see connection pooling being used in other places like DBOutputFormat. Is it OK if we address this as a separate JIRA? Unless you are concerned this particular change will introduce performance regression. Typically, for a DBInputFormat instance, I would expect just a single call to create an instance of RecordReader., [~rkannan82] Thank you for the contribution. I prefer to keep the method getConnection since it's public method. Also, TestDbClasses shouldn't be changed. 

About the connection pool, I'd like to +1 to do on separate JIRA., Fixed the patch to retain getConnection method.

This message is automatically generated., [~rkannan82] the latest change looks an incompatible change - new getConnection() method can return null.

The current semantics of getConnection() is to create new connection to DB and cannot return null. I think we should preserve not only the method name "getConnection()" but also the semantics for backward compatibility though I know the name of getConnection() is confusing. Would you update a patch?, I understand that this causes a change in behavior. But I would like to point out my understanding of how this API is meant to be used. If you still feel that I should bring back the old behavior, I will do so.

- getConnection is a public method, so anyone can access it. I don't know why it was done this way because it breaks encapsulation. Except for the subclasses, no one else should care about accessing the Connection object. In fact, subclasses can already access it without this method because its a protected variable.

- But to avoid breaking subclasses that already use this API to access the connection, we need to keep it. So I updated the patch.

- The connection object is created inside setConf method. So it is guaranteed to be not null unless the caller explicitly called the close method and then tried to access the connection again. This is an improper usage of the API. I doubt if anyone would be using it that way. But if a subclass is doing this, then it is better to fix that., Thank you for clarification. I know you're correct and my suggestion is not clean fix, but I think this issue is one of critical issues to be fixed for branch-2 and 2.6.1. To commit this to branch-2 and 2.6.1, incompatible changes are not accepted since it's public class. My suggestion is:

* Let's fix the bug here with full backward compatibility about public methods to commit this to branch-2.
* How about fixing the behavior cleanly which targets trunk on separate JIRA?
