[In spirit, this is same as MAPREDUCE-2413, but we'll probably get away with a far cleaner implementation with NodeManager.

 - Overall, we have a list of local dirs and a list of log-dirs which we want to periodically check for sanity and have NM automatically offline one/more of them when they go bad.
 - We won't touch(for e.g., kill) any running containers when a disk goes bad. We'll let the running containers fail if at all.
 - All the future containers will avoid the bad disks and get their paths to work on the remaining good disks.
 - NM should perhaps piggyback on the health report, and update to the RM if any disks are going bad, helps a lot for operability.
  - Also, if all or a major percentage of disks turn bad at startup, NodeManager should either fail to start or get started, and report the RM that it is bad and needs operator intervention.
  - If all or a major percentage of disks turn bad during runtime, NodeManager can update the RM and ask for a halt in the scheduling., Ravi - thanks for taking this up!, Let's get this in for 0.23., Damn, wrong JIRA., Will failure detection to work similarly to MR1, ie there's a periodic local dir checker thread that marks directories as failed? In MR1 attempts to access local dirs by a container that fail do not necesarily result in the local dir being marked as failed. Since eg a failure that causes a write to a log to fail may not cause the dir checking to fail. If the key places that frequently access local disk - logging and writing intermediate data - handle disk failure than the container can fail-fast and we may identify failures that otherwise go unnoticed.

Will there be any dependency on the NM health checker script?  

Can disk failures be considered transient? Do we want to support disks coming back online? In MR1 a disk failure means the disk is blacklisted until TT restart. 

Is the AM treated like a container as well? Ie it's  allowed to run and fail and the NM will restart it?
 
IIUC the RM doesn't currently consider disks in it's allocation policy, therefore the "major percentage" that's needed to offline the NM should take this into account right? This is similar to the issue in MR1 where we don't throttle slots based on the number of available disks.

What's the plan for testing? Adding some basic fault injection (either manually as in the NN or via a framework) to the commonly used paths would make testing easier than what we do in MR1. , Yes. Adding a TimerTask that checks periodically nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs. This component maintains the list of nm-local-dirs and the list of nm-log-dirs. Everybody accesses nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs from this component.

Very little dependency on the NM health checker script. Script should not return error(s) when disk failures are identified(especially when there are some good disks). This behavior is similar to what is there in 0.20(i.e. MR1).

Disks coming back again after failure can be supported as a later enhancement. This JIRA gets mostly similar to 0.20 behavior.

As part of this JIRA, AM is similar to any other container and nothing is done as part of this JIRA. We can think of enhancing the behavior later, if really needed.

Once RM is enhanced to consider disks in its allocation policy, we can enhance this JIRA's work by propagating the info of disks' health from NM to RM. So for now, am not planning to change RM as part of this JIRA.

Am planning to have the basic unit test(s) similar to the patch of MR2850. Let us see if something better can be done., Attaching patch that makes NodeManager to identify disk failures (for nodemanager-local-dirs and nodemanager-log-dirs) and makes sure to use good local-dirs and good log-dirs for the containers to be launched after disk-failure-identification.

This message is automatically generated., Code level summary of the patch attached:

(1) Node Manager launches DiskHealthCheckeraService that periodically launches/executes the disk-health-check-code. A new configuration property yarn.nodemanger.disk-health-checker.interval-ms is added for the frequency with which this code is executed, with a default value of 120*1000ms(i.e. 2minutes).

(2) LocalStorage is a new class that manages a list of local file system directories and provides api for checking the health of those directories (mostly similar to TaskTracker.LocalStorgae class of 0.20 except that this class' checkDirs() doesn't throw DiskErrorException when all directories fail but returns true if a new disk-failure is seen.

(3) DiskHealthCheckerService maintains 2 LocalStorage objects ---- one for nm-local-dirs and second one for nm-log-dirs.

(4) ContainerExecutor is initialized with the DiskHealthCheckerService object. So both DefaultContainerExecutor.java and LinuxContainerExecutor.java get good nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs from the DiskHealthChecker always.

(5) container-executor binary gets good nm-local-dirs and good nm-log-dirs as a parameter and uses these good dirs only. So these are removed from the configuration file(i.e. not needed to be configured in container-executor.cfg configuration file).

(6) Whenever a new container gets launched, the good nm-local-dirs and good nm-log-dirs are updated in the configuration sothat containers won't access bad disks. Everybody (localizer, webserver) goes through DiskHealthChecker to access nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs.

(7) On the NodeManager web UI, NodeHealthReport will be showing the lost of good nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs in addition to true/false about the health of the node.

(8) A new unit test TestDiskFailures is added that makes disks(both nm-local-dirs and nm-log-dirs) fail and checks/validates if the NodeManager/DiskHealthChecker can identifies these disk-failures or not.

\\
Tested the patch with (1) DefaultContainerExecutor and (2) LinuxContainerExecutor on my single node cluster. The functionality seems to be working fine with disk failures getting identified by NodeManager and the bad nm-local-dirs and bad nm-log-dirs getting avoided for new containers., Thanks for the comprehensive summary, Ravi! I am looking at the patch for review now., Was doing a brief review on the patch. A couple of points I saw - will go through the patch in more detail later. 

1. I believe the return in ContainersLaunch#handle when no good disks are available requires a ContainerExitedWithFailure event to be triggered for the container state machine to handle the failure and clean up appropriately. When you do this, I think in the cleanup case, we need to add a null check on rContainerDatum. Please add appropriate test cases to see that the container state machine works correctly if all disks have failed.

2. A general comment about the handling of passing around of the diskchecker object or calling of the getLocalDirs()/getLogDirs() functions. Given that there is a timer task involved that will be updating the values in the background, there may various inconsistencies which may crop up based on when the functions are called. 

For example, in the Linux Executor, the final command being constructed uses 2 calls: 
   - checker.getLocalDirsString()
   - checker.getLocalPaths()

There could be modifications done during the time that elapses between the 2 calls that may create issues. Also, now the executor also needs to check if there is atleast one good disk available.

IMO, one approach we could take is to do a check at the top level. For example, ContainersLaunch as per the patch does a sanity check on available disks and bails if there is an issue. It could create a snapshot of available disks at this point 
and pass them to the ContainerLaunch which in turn will pass them on to the executor's launch container call. This will also probably help in simplifying the code in that the low level components no longer need to be worried about checking if there are any good disks available.





 

 , My comments on the patch.
----
*Major:*
DiskHealthCheckerService
 - Let us not use the configuration property to read the dir-list anywhere. I already see a couple of places where this can be trouble-some. Make sure that YarnConfiguration.NM_LOCAL_DIRS and YarnConfiguration.NM_LOG_DIRS aren't read anywhere after the initial NM-start.
   -- After this, you should definitely drop DiskHealthCheckerService.updateDirsInConfiguration().
 - ResourceLocalizationService.localDirsSelector doesn't look at healthy disks, same for ShuffleHandler.
 - Let's have a single API to return local-dirs either Array or a list. Let the caller take care of any conversions they need. Ditto about getLocalDirsString()/getLogDirsString().
 - Same as above for the LocalStorage class and getNumDirs() methods in there.
 - Instead of setting the disksInfo in NodePage, we can set it directly in the health-report via NodeStatusUpdater. That way, RM will also get the report.

bq. IMO, one approach we could take is to do a check at the top level. For example, ContainersLaunch as per the patch does a sanity check on available disks and bails if there is an issue. It could create a snapshot of available disks at this point.
Agreed, we should check at ContainersLauncherImpl level before launching every container and send out a container-failed event in case all disks have gone bad.
----
*Minor:*
DiskHealthCheckerService
 - DisksHealthMonitorExecutor can be static and final.
 - Drop the constructor DiskHealthCheckerService(Configuration conf) and use init() life-cycle directly.
 - init(Configuration conf): call super.init() at the end so that it can set the service-state correctly. Same for start(), stop()
 - Declare diskHealthChecker as a DisksHealthMonitorExecutor instead of TimerTask so as to avoid unnecessary casting in get{Log|Local}Dirs()
 - LocalStorage is way too general. Let's rename LocalStorage to LocalDirectories?

Let's have multiple local and log-dirs by default in MiniYarnCluster.

TestDiskFailures:
 - No need for hard-coded 2 secs sleep, MiniYarnCluster already has code to wait for starting.
 - waitForDiskHealthCheck() is error-prone. You can set an inline DiskHealthChecker and invoke explicit checking of disks.
----
*Miscellaneous:*
Like I summarized in my first comment, there are more pending items. Let me know if you want to tackle them separately:
 - We need a configuration for the max-percentage of disks that can fail without shutting down NM.
 - If all or a major percentage of disks turn bad at startup, NodeManager should either fail to start or get started, and report the RM that it is bad and needs operator intervention.
 - If all or a major percentage of disks turn bad during runtime, NodeManager can update the RM and ask for a halt in the scheduling.
, Took a look at the patch and current comments. I'll go through it again when the next version becomes available. Mostly nits. 
- Is log aggregator properly dealing with log directories going away?
- container-executor.h: @param comments should be adjusted, array of char pointers can be const
- container-executor/impl/main.c - The argc checks for  LAUNCH and SIGNAL seem like they should be != checks instead of < checks. Also, the Usage statements for INITIALIZE and LAUNCH use "tokens" instead of cred_file, pid_file. 
- configuration.c - I think the realloc allocates more than necessary but you didn't introduce this and it shouldn't introduce any problems under normal circumstances. (The MAX_SIZE shouldn't be in that part of the calculation. It's already compensated for in toPassSize.)
, Attaching new patch incorporating most of the review comments. Will discuss the remaining minor comments with Vinod soon and upload another patch.

Added a new configuration property for "minimum fraction of number of disks that are to be healthy for considering a node to be healthy interms of disks". It is <em>yarn.nodemanager.disk-health-checker.min-healthy-disks</em>. It's default value is 0.05. i.e. By default, a node is considered unhealthy if there are only less than 5% of disks are healthy., Attaching new patch with a minor fix to earlier patch., Just going through submitting patch.

This message is automatically generated., Some comments: 
  - DISKS_FAILED 144 is probably not a good idea. It clashes with SIGUSR1. We could use EIO or any other relevant exit code related to file system errors. Another option is to use a non-clashing exit code along the lines of container aborted ( -100 ). Anyone have any preferences on which approach to leverage? The latter will obviously be a more clear indicator on what the failure was and allow easy blacklisting of this node/re-scheduling on other nodes.
  - Should the the failed disks error information be propagated into the app/container diagnostics?
  - Should there be a check for whether there are any good dirs left in ResourceLocalizationService before starting of localizing the resources?
 , >> Should there be a check for whether there are any good dirs left in ResourceLocalizationService before starting of localizing the resources?

If there are no good local dirs available, then the previous lines of code
{code}nmPrivateCTokensPath = diskHandler.getLocalPathForWrite(){/code} will through IOExcpetion. So I think checking again is unnecessary --- unless there is a race condition(disk failure is identified just before the call to startLocalizer(), for which there is very very little chance). With the current patch itself, if there are no good local dirs, then startLocalizer() will anyway fail/throwException.

Anyway, I will add a diskHandler.areDisksHealthy() check in the next version of the patch., Cancelling patch for progress., bq. Anyway, I will add a diskHandler.areDisksHealthy() check in the next version of the patch.
  My question was more of whether the task should start even if there is one healthy disk available. i.e. below the specified % failure threshold but there are still some healthy disks available. There are 2 parts to the health of a node. The state of disks when the node is already scheduled to setup/launch a container and the health status reported to the RM by the NM. The latter simply checks for the threshold. Now, in case of launching the container after the resources are localized ( in ContainersLaunch), the patch checks for the threshold whereas in the resource localization service, as mentioned above, it seems to only need one healthy disk to be available. I am fine with either approach as long as it is a common approach. We could follow the same approach as the one taken in 0.20.xxx if no one has any preferences on either.
, We can stop launching/settingup whenever we hit the threshold for percentage of disks-failures., Attaching new patch.
Refactored and cleaned up code, added more testcases.

NodeHealthCheckerService is a composite service containing 2 services NodeHealthScriptRunner and DiskHandlerService., Okay, still a monster patch, but in a far better shape. I anticipate just one more iteration.

 - Please don't include util like APIs in NodeHealthStatus record, we want to keep the record implementations to the bare essentials.
 - Pass DiskHandlerService everywhere instead of NodeHealthCheckerService.
 - Change DISKS_FAILED to not use 144. May be -1001.
 - Remove unused imports in ContainersLauncher.
 - Remove the commented out init() code in ContainerExecutor.
 - Rename LocalStorage to DirectoryCollection?
 - getHealthScriptTimer() belongs to the HealthScriptRunner itself. Let's make nodeHealthScriptRunner.getTimerTask() public and drop TimerTask getHealthScriptTimer() from NodeHealthCheckerService.
 - Trivial: (java)doc NodeHealthCheckerService class.

ContainerLaunch: When all disks have failed, use the health-report in the exception *and* also add a diagnostics to the event.
 - Same in ResourceLocalizationService
 - DiskHandlerService: when major-percentage disks are gone, log the report. (+108)

ResourceLocalizationService:
 - Take a snapshot of dirs before the health-check for startLocalizer()?
 - PublicLocalizer uses a LocalDirAllocator for downloading file. Should it instead use DiskHandlerService? May be also check for min-percentage disks to be alive for each addResource() request. You will need changes to FSDownload too.
 - Remove PUBCACHE_CTXT after doing above.

AppLogAggregatorImpl:
 - Existing log message at +120 can also list the good dirs. Bad dirs can be deduced from the DHS logs.

DiskHandlerService:
 - The APIs with size are not needed or don't need the size paramater itself.
 - Take a lock on the cloned config for accesses via updateDirsInConfiguration(), getLocalPathForWrite(String pathStr) etc. where configuration is accessed.

MiniYARNCluster:
 - Change the default the numLocalDirs and numLogDirs to 4? Also, consolidate the constructors? I can see the N number of constructors pattern of MiniMRCluster, let's avoid that.

conf/controller.cfg
 - Update to not have the removed configs.
 - Can you also add banned.users and min.user.id with the default values?

TestDiskFailure:
 - verifyDisksHealth(): Loop through and wait for a max of say 10 seconds for the node to turn unhealthy.
 - waitForDiskHealthCheck(): We can capture DiskHandlerService's last report time and wait till it changes atleast once. Of course that should be capped by a upper limit on the wait time.

Can you run the linux-container-executor tests: TestLinuxContainerExecutor and TestContainerManagerWithLCE?
Create a separate ticket for handling the disks that come back up online.
Create a separate ticket for having a metric for numFailedDirs.

Test plan:
 - RM stops scheduling when major-percentage of disks go bad: Done
 - Node's DiskHandler recognises bad disks: Done
 - Node's DiskHandler recognises minimum percentage of good disks : Done
 - Integration test: Run a mapreduce job (so that Shuffle is also verified), offline some disks, run one more job and verify that both the apps pass. TODO
 - LogAggregation test: Verify that logs written on bad disks are ignored for aggregation (augment TestLogAggregationService) TODO:
 - ContainerLaunch: Verify that
   -- new containers don't use bad directories(by testing the LOCAL_DIRS env in a custom map job): TODO
   -- if major percentage disks turn bad,
      -- container should exit with proper exit code(should be easy with a custom application). TODO
      -- localization for a resource fails TODO , @Vinod, for failed disks, did you mean to say -101 and not -1001? -1000 denotes invalid container status whereas -100 denotes container aborted. , Looks like the change has similar assumptions as MR1, eg the boot disk is either raided or we're using a health checker script to stop the services if the boot disk fails. Worth mentioning this in the docs.

I think it would make more sense to name the classes LocalDir* instead of Disk* since we're checking local dirs and not disks. For example, we only check the given dirs so if there's a failure on another sector of the disk it won't notice. The NM won't handle boot disk failures even if it detects a failure on a dir hosted on the boot disk because it's dir-centric (ie doesn't know that the disk has failed, just that a dir has). Similarly the local dirs and log dirs may of course reside on the same disk so if we were checking disks we wouldn't need to check them independently. The DN calls this "volume checking" for the same rationale, something similar here would make sense as well. I'd call it LocalDirChecker and have it live in common next to LocalDirAllocator. This way HDFS could re-use the code.

5% seems pretty low. How did you arrive at that? Are you sure you want a 12 disk host with only 1 working disk to keep running?, Attaching new patch. Addressed all the review comments except the integration tests for other components. Will raise a separate JIRA for them as the current patch is already having tests that check the basic functionality of the patch., >> 5% seems pretty low.
Increased the default percentage to 25%.

This message is automatically generated., In this design are disk failures visible to the job client? Ie if you submit a job in a loop and fail local disks will any of the job submissions fail (assuming there are a sufficient # disks)?

One of the things I noticed with MR-2015 is that while the TT can tolerate disk failures that's not necessarily the case for clients. Eg local TT disk failures seen in TaskLauncher#run, TaskRunner#run, MapTask#run, are all visible to (and can hang) the JobClient, causing jobs to fail., Meant MR-2413, not MR-2015 in that last comment., @Eli,
  The patch attached allows the NM to tolerate disk failures as the TT did in MR-2413. The current MR code (both in 0.23 and 0.20.205) does not distinguish why a task failed, could be a disk failure on a node or IO error. So the client will see it as a failure. We could later sometime do optimizations to be smart about disk failures (saying a task failure on a node with disk failure doesnt count against max num failures) but I think it might have diminishing returns in production environments. Want to open a jira to track it?
