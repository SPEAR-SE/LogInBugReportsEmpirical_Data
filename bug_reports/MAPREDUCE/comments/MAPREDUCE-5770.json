[The issue is that MR is reseting the HTTP_POLICY config to be HTTP_ONLY for the security purpose, and so AMIpFilter is always using HTTP_ONLY picked up from the config for constructing the redirection  URL to the proxy.

Fixed it by passing the HTTP_ONLY as a parameter to the web app. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks fine enough to me that I think it works. Can you add test-case though?, Added a test case for testing MR web app is explicitly disabling SSL.

The AM-URL redirected by amIPFilter to web proxy is not easily tested since there is one more issue that, amIpFilter is not able to differentiate the request coming from web proxy or from the localhost if it's a local machine cluster setup., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
