[The Job History Server will throw a 500 error until MR-2926 is resolved, and then it will have this error when accessing an actual Job., We should just drop the 'isUber' stuff... with MRv2 this isn't useful, right?, I thought that MRV2 had an uber mode where it ran the entire map/reduce as part of the application master?  If not then yes it should be dropped., It does. The 'isUber' *code* is legacy of MAPREDUCE-1220 which isn't relevant in MR2 context. Makes sense?, I take it back, we can expose 'uberness' in JobHistory - I confused this with JobClient...

Robert, if you have a patch I'll review/commit. Thanks, and sorry for causing the confusion., This issue is a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-2996 and MAPREDUCE-2675

MAPREDUCE-2675 removed the exception and made the result false.  MAPREDUCE-2996 will add in the needed information to be able to fully support isUber in Completed task ]
