[First draft of the patch, patch to allow building of tar via ant in mapreduce dir too., Committed a updated version of this patch:
* Use mockito-all instead of mockito-core
* Use type instead of classifier.

Thanks Bobby!, Thanks Thomas for the second part of the fix as well. I kept the junit in main dependency as it's needed for examples to run.]
