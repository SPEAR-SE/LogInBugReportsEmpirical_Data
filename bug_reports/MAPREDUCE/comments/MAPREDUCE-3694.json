[I suspect the problem is with following:
0.20.20x code :
{noformat}
public JobStatus getJobStatus(JobID id) {
    Job job = jobs.get(id);
    if(job != null)
      return job.status;
    else 
      return null;
  }
{noformat}

{noformat}
 public org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobStatus getJobStatus(
      org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.JobID id) {
    Job job = jobs.get(JobID.downgrade(id));
    if(job != null)
      return job.status;
    else 
      return null;
  }
{noformat}

so Mostly, Looking into jobs through JobID.downgrade(id) might be causing the problem, Problem was because code was compiled against both 0.20 and 0.23. When I compiled the code against 0.23 alone, I do not see the issue any more.]
