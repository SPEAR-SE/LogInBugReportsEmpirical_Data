[MRAppMaster received shutdown signal just before executing start method of ContainerAllocatorRouter service. So while executing shutdown hook 
of MRAppMaster

{code:title=MRAppMaster.java|borderStyle=solid}
if(appMaster.containerAllocator instanceof ContainerAllocatorRouter) {
        ((ContainerAllocatorRouter) appMaster.containerAllocator)
        .setSignalled(true);
      }
{code} 

above code tries set the flag of containerAllocator object in ContainerAllocatorRouter#setSignalled(). But containerAllocator object has been instantiated while executing start method. So containerAllocator is null and hence NPE., Attaching patch. Please review, Putting in Patch Available so that Jenkins can test it. , -1 overall.

I did a quick look at your patch and I am a bit confused by the implementation of setSignaled.  I realize that you did not really change the code at all, but is there a reason that the parameter is ignored?  If you don't know I can look into it myself., Hi Robert,
 Thanks for looking into the patch. I totally ignored the unregister method in RMCommunicator. I modified the patch and most of the changes are re-factoring like moving object instantiation to init method etc...   If you feel, this is not the right way to fix this, please look into this issue., Kicking Jenkins again, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

It could be a hickup in Jenkins, but could you please try to upmerge and verify that everything still builds and runs correctly., To fix this issue, I just re-factored the existing code. After re-factoring I successfully ran *wordcount* and *terasort* examples.
