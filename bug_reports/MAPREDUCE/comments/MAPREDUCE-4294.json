[@Nishan,

Could you please explain in more detail how to reproduce this issue?  Perhaps it is just me but I don't know how to enable task profiling., If we execute wordcount example by enabling profiling like below, it is occurring always.

{code:xml}
>bin# ./yarn jar ../share/hadoop/mapreduce/hadoop-mapreduce-examples-*.jar 
wordcount -Dmapreduce.task.profile=true /in /out
{code}


Job Client is trying to get task attempt logs using TaskLogServlet (i.e tasklog url pattern) which doesn't exist in the latest code and causing 400 error., It was fixed some time ago.]
