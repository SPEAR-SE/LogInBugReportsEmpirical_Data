[This problem is fixed by MAPREDUCE-157 in trunk. The old (.20 and older) regex parser is too brittle to handle large values., Patch for y20s branch (probably works with generic 0.20.x as well): one line change to add possessive qualifiers to mutually exclusive patterns to avoid useless backtracking and hence stack overflow for values with many escaped characters., Luke, Can you add the test-case for trunk, just to be sure that it works on trunk ?, Amarsri, my test case for the old parser exploits details of the old file format and weaknesses of Java's backtracking NFA regex implementation.  The new implementation in trunk uses the standard json format and a mature json parser (jackson) with about 700 tests. It'll be counterproductive for me to add any tests to have any material impact to the test coverage of the new parser., I reviewed Luke's change, and it looks correct to me.

I agree with Luke that {{trunk}} does not have this problem and does not need this patch or any revision of this patch.

, Committed in y20s branch as well., This isn't committed on any of the branches on apache svn. Reopening this., This is valid only for 20.3 as it is fixed on branches 0.21 and above.

Please close this as WON'T FIX if there is no intention to provide a patch for 0.20 branch.]
