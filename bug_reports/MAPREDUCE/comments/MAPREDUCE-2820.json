In the case where multiple  temp dirs are configured, hadoop should avoid using a dir when it's available space is below certain threshold.
, Configuring mapred.local.dir.minspacestart by user should solve this problem.

Currently, the default value of mapred.local.dir.minspacestart is 0 bytes. How about changing this default value to a +ve value(say 1MB) in mapred.default.xml ?

Thoughts ?, It should also be possible to set minspacestart to a reasonable value in mapred-site.xml, no? , Actually, I'd propose that we backport the 0.19 items - HADOOP-657 (and probably another related issue - HADOOP-9) to handle this issue.. HADOOP-657 seems like a better approach for the problem described.. thoughts?, In addition to HADOOP-657, setting some sensible value for the minspacestart in mapred-site.xml should also be done, Devaraj suggested porting JIRA-657's patch to branch 18 would be better. It applies fine to branch 18. Looking into the code of that patch to understand what is happening., bq. Actually, I'd propose that we backport the 0.19 items - HADOOP-657 (and probably another related issue - HADOOP-9) to handle this issue.

Uh, we can't add new features to a released branch?, This has been fixed.]
