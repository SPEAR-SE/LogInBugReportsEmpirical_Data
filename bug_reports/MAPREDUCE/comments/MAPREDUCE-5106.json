[Looking at branch-1's implementation (JobInProgress), this is not a current problem. Resolving as Not a Problem. The config is taken from the JobTracker.getConf() call so the two cannot be mixed as reported.

What version were you using?, I am using 0.20.2 version, where config is loaded from job.xml 

this.localJobFile = default_conf.getLocalPath(JobTracker.SUBDIR+"/"+jobId + ".xml");
conf = new JobConf(localJobFile);

I have tested this as well. It is okay to close this issue if it is fixed in 1.0.]
