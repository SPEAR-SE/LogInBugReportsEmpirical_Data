[HADOOP-7639 is making is possible for the HttpServer to add path specifications to the filters.  The yarn Webapp can then pass in the path specifications they are going to service when creating the httpserver (ie /yarn, /yarn*).  We should make sure all WebApps have a name/base serve path spec so that it doesn't mess up any of the other servlets.  ie should be of the format <host:port>/somename/*

This is a bit ugly but I think it would potentially mess up other existing apps if we were to add the filter for /*.  All of them currently have a name anyway.  Since many of the yarn UI's currently don't append the /somename to the uri's in links (like in the RM nodes page) and just have host:port, I am making it redirect anything from host:port/ to the registered webapp name host:port/somename.  Ideally I think all the ui links should be updated but that can be done separately., Another issue I just thought of is that since all the yarn webapps (rm/nm/am/jh) have the same urls host:port/yarn/*, that doesn't lend itself to easily filter and say have some authenticated and others not based on the url.  Perhaps naming them differently is a better idea. Something more like ResourceManager -> host:port/rm/* , NodeManager -> host:port/nm/*, etc...   Thoughts?, patch to make the filtering work.

I think I will file separate jira for the naming issue (where everything is /yarn/*)., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., hmm, looks like the changes from HADOOP-7639 weren't picked up my hudson yet., Having looked at the patch. But shouldn't passing "/" to HttpServer only filter the root-path and not everything? If that is true, then we don't need all the redirecting magic.

Cancelling the patch to fix the findBugs warnings and code changes in case my above comment is valid., bq. Having looked at the patch
I meant "Haven't"., So it doesn't appear that registering "/" or the redirect I have implemented now actually fully work because they both block the base log servlet from serving /logs.

I think whats happening is that if you try to go to /logs it goes to the logs servlet (AdminAuthorizedServlet.class), then it goes to the filters.  Since guice has the "/" registered guice hijacks it and tries to dispatch it on its own and the logs servlet never gets it back.

Now I changed the pathSpec on the /logs to /* (logContext.addServlet(AdminAuthorizedServlet.class, "/*")).  Then the guice filter doesn't hijack it and logs is served up.  I don't quite understand why this works as I would have thought the pathSpec being served was still "/" and guice filter would have grabbed it.  Any servlet experts out there that can explain that?

Another option might be to not have guice register "/" and have an index.html that redirects it similar to how jobtracker and namenode do now., I filed HADOOP-7662 to fix the issue with /logs.  That does mean that we could just register "/" instead of doing the redirect.  However I think the redirect makes it easier for filters to differentiate urls.  This goes along with MAPREDUCE-3021.  If we allow all the webapps to use host:port/ then the filters have no way of differentiation rm from nm from am, etc. The redirect would allow the filters to work as well as still allow you to go to host:port/. We can either leave redirect how it is in the patch or we could probably put in index.html similar to how jobtracker/namenode did redirect.  , Updated a new patch. the things it implements:

- update to use new HttpServer constructor added in HADOOP-7639. Registers pathspecs for "/", "/<webapp name> , "/<webapp name>/*".  If not webapp name provided then it registered "/", "/*".
- Add a redirect from / to /<webapp name>.  This is to allow a filter to be able to differentiate pages.

All of the base servlets still work as long as HADOOP-7662 (for /logs) is included.  Filters now apply properly to the yarn webapps., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Was working on some of my patches, couldn't sneak in the review of this patch. Will look at it tomorrow., Patch looks good, resubmitting to Jenkins just to be sure, been a while the last time it was blessed., reattaching same patch to kick jenkins., Manual testing done:

Test with and without an auth filter (config settinghadoop.http.filter.initializers).  When filter setting is set verified that the load of each page properly went through the filter specified. When going through the filter the page properly showed the current User in the upper right hand corner.  Without the filter it shows the default hadoop user of "dr.who".  Modified my auth filter to be able to choose which pages to actually authenticate and which not to.  When it didn't authenticate pages verified that anyone could go there and the upper right corner was empty (didn't show the "Logged in as:").

Tested that all the yarn web pages and links from yarn web pages to other pages worked.  For instance RM page has link to node manager, links from app to job history and to app master.  Verified the links from app master back to RM work,  etc... and that when the filter is there they properly go through the filter and ask for authentication.

Verify that each yarn web app allows the user to get there from:
  - host:port/         ->  This redirects you to host:port/yarn so that the filter can differentiate and chose to authenticate or not
  - host:port/yarn     -> goes to default page specified by webapp
  - host:port/yarn/*   -> goes to page specified by webapp

Verify that all of the default applications registered in HttpServer still work.  (note that HADOOP-7662 is needed for the /logs to work).
