[attaching a preliminary patch , needs more testing, it needs to be applied on 893, Uploading patch with test case., The UI is not being displayed when a hierarchy of queues in built with atleast one container queue (i.e., atleast one non-leaf queue). 
There is no check for occurrence of null pointer in CapacityTaskScheduler.getJobs(queueName) and when the container queue's name is given as input parameter, it fails with NPE.

The above patch is to handle this issue. It also includes test cases written to check the behaviour when a job is submitted to a container queue., Quickly looked at the patch and tested it on a single node. It works fine. Some review comments, mostly minor:
 - In CapacityTaskScheduler.getJobs(), we can cache the return value from jobQueuesManager.getJobQueue(queueName) to avoid repetitive lookups.
 - Test-cases testSubmitToQueues(), testGetJobs() and the newly added testJobsForContainerQueues() share a lot of common stuff and test a single concept - job submission to capacity-scheduler. They can be combined into a single testJobSubmission(). Further, instead of creating all the internal queue-related data-structures ourselves, we can simply create a configuration file and start the scheduler. See TestRefreshOfQueues.testSuccessfulCapacityRefresh() for an example. You may need to do some refactoring to facilitate this.

One orthogonal point which this issue may not concern itself with, jobtracker.jsp is now printing the number of root-queues under a header 'queues'. Just looking at it, it didn't tell me what it actually represents. We can (1) rename it to root-queues to be clear, or (2) print both root-queues' and job-queues' number or (3) do away with these numbers altogether and just give a hyper-link to the queues page.

This message is automatically generated., Some minor comments:

1. Check if a queue has children or not in getJobsFromQueue(String queue) method.
 2. getQueue(String queue) in JobTracker would return NPE for invalid queue name(Not related to jira but still a bug).

, Uploading patch with the check for presence of children in getJobsFromQueue(String queue) method.
The other comment will be handled in a separate jira (MAPREDUCE-1075)., patch seems fine , except 1 minor nit.

1. in getJobsFromQueue if unvalid queueName is passed it would throw NPE.
instead we should check for this condition and throw exception.

, Uploading patch with corrections related to the above comment., The previous patch has redundant check for queueManager.getJobQueueInfo(queue) being null. 
Uploading patch with this removed, The check for queueManager being null is redundant in the previous patch. Uploading patch with this rectified., +1, -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
