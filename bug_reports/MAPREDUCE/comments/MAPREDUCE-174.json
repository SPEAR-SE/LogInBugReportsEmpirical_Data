[Attaching a patch that adds a _stop()_ api to indicate that the thread is required to stop. Every thread now loops on _stop_ variable instead of looping forever., I think Thread#interrupt() would work if no code in the thread caught and ignored InterruptedException, but, unfortunately, there's a lot of code in Hadoop that does catch and ignore this exception.  Given that, the best practice is to both use a flag and an interrupt, belt and suspenders.  +1 for the patch., Closing as stale.]
