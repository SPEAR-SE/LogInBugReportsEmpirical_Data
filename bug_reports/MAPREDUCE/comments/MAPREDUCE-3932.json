[Making it critical, @Vinod I know you are swamped is it OK with you if I take this one?, I traced out the State Machine for TaskAttemptImpl and I verified that all states after ASSIGNED, can handle TA_CONTAINER_LAUNCHED and/or TA_CONTAINER_LAUNCH_FAILED depending on how they are returned.  I also looked at the JobImpl state Machine ad did a similar thing for the Counter Updates., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Bobby, the patch looks good. Couple of minor comments.
The additional comment in TestTaskAttempt about "testAttemptContainerRequest" needing to run first - nice catch, would be useful to have a little more info in the comment though (referring to ContainerLaunchContext creation ?).
Also, I believe the new test you added can be run without bothering with credentials, tokens etc., Thanks for the review Sid.  I will update the comments, and try to remove the unneeded token stuff.  I was lazy and did a copy and paste. , This patch addresses Sid's comments., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
