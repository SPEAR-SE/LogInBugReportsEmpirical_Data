[I'm doing a test right now.  The output of hadoop-streaming is being sent to a pipe, so one theory for what's happening is that hadoop-streaming blocks when it writes because the output buffer is full.

If this is the cause, then there's no bug in hadoop-streaming per se, but the problem would go away if there were an option for quiet output (don't write out the percent complete, etc.).

I'll add another comment to this when I find out for sure.  Thanks., The hanging seems to have been caused by blocked writes to a pipe.  I have a workaround, but it would be nice if hadoop-streaming could be configured to quiet mode.  Thanks., Is the input to map task or reduce task empty ?
HADOOP-4620 fixed the hanging streaming tasks issue for the case of empty input. If this issue is same as that, please resolve this JIRA as duplicate of HADOOP-4620. Otherwise, please provide details of how to reproduce the issue., Dupe of HADOOP-4620]
