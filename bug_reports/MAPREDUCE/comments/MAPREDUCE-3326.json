[Also note that when you click on a child queue it doesn't properly show you the applications running in that queue., A recent jira MAPREDUCE-1118 may have updated the displayed capacity scheduler information and certainly has changed the layout of the information., Thanks Jon! 

Not sure if I am missing / misunderstanding something, but upon reading the discussion, it seems that MAPREDUCE-1118 applies only to 0.20 and 0.22 and not 0.23 / mrv2.

, Not missing anything. 20 and 22 will be a better reference for what this should look like with the addition MAPREDUCE-1118., Patch provides a dropdown textbox for each capacity scheduler leaf queue showing:

- Queue State
- Capacity
- Max Capacity
- Used Capacity
- Absolute Capacity
- Absolute Max Capacity
- Utilization
- Used Resources
- Num Active Applications
- Num Pending Applications
- Num Containers
- Max Applications
- Max Applications Per User
- Max Active Applications
- Max Active Applications Per User
- User Limit
- User Limit Factor

By default the dropdown text box for each leaf queue is hidden so it doesn't clutter the initial rendering of the page.

In addition the application filtering is improved but not totally fixed.  Clicking on a leaf queue now properly filters for the specific queue (no more accidental substring matching on other queues), but filtering on a parent queue is still broken.  Fixing the filtering for the parent queues is a bit more involved and should be handled by another JIRA.

This message is automatically generated., Similar to Tom's comment on MAPREDUCE-3299, should we ensure we have the same info via web-services as part of this? , Sorry I forgot to mention that the patch is implemented in terms of the web dao objects, so the web services have access to the same information as the web page.  The web services tests were updated as part of the patch to verify this.  I was going to update the web services documentation, but Tom informed me that part hasn't been written yet.  Tom said he'd update the docs to describe the new fields in the web dao objects before the first draft is submitted.  If those docs go in before this patch then I can update the patch, or we can file a JIRA to track updating the docs., One nit - an existing bug is that the display of the queue's used capacity at runtime is broken because it display's 'used' relative to the queue's capacity and not the parent's capacity as shown in the above attachment.

I think the display should be relative to parent's capacity and not leaf queues as everything else in the display is relative to parent's capacity.

Jason, if you don't mind  can we fix that alongwith this patch? Thanks!, docs will be handled under MAPREDUCE-3549 - I added a comment., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
