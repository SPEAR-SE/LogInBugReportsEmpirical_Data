[As was mentioned on the Bigtop JIRA this looks related to HADOOP-8726, [~rvs], I was debugging this with [~jarcec] on Friday. Following our findings:

Sqoop2 sets some custom credential for the DB in the Job before submission. The mappers can use successfully this DB credential from the JobContext.

But Sqoop's OutputCommitter, which runs in the AM, fails to get the DB credentials from the JobContext.

Poking around a bit, and modifying Sqoop's OutputCommitter to use the credentials from the UGI's current user instead of the JobContext, things work fine.

While at first I was seeing this as a potential bug in sqoop, fixable using the UGI's credential, now I think this is a regression in YARN (as it works in Hadoop 1).

I think the correct fix for this is to make sure the JobContext in the AM is configured with the UGI's current user credentials., I was just debugging this and Alejandro, your (timely) comment helped me avoid doing it all over again. Your analysis is correct.

+1., Roman, I'm cleaning some part of this code via MAPREDUCE-5199. If you want I can give a quick patch for this alone.., Vinod, if it is not too difficult I'd greatly appreciate a small patch for specifically this very issue. Thanks!, [~vinodkv] having a patch for this one would be greatly appreciated, thank you!, This should work.

Jarek/Roman, can you help validate this patch with Sqoop? Tx., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

I tested Sqoop with Hadoop built with this patch and was able to run an import and export job successfully.

For those interested, I installed patched Hadoop from http://bigtop01.cloudera.org:8080/job/Hadoop-2.0.4/label=centos6/lastSuccessfulBuild/artifact/output/hadoop/ and ran it in pseudo distributed mode. I also downloaded and installed sqoop (v. 1.99.2) from Bigtop. I created a MySQL table with a primary key column and a bunch of other columns and imported data from there to HDFS and then exported to the same data back to MySQL to a different empty table with same schema as the other table.

You have my +1 (non-committer)., [~mgrover] thank you Mark for testing this, greatly appreciated!, Thanks Mark, I'll ping another committer to quickly review this., Vinod, instead of replacing YarnConfiguration with JobConf in the app master, can this change be localized. i.e. use a JobConf object only when initializing the OutputCommitter.
We shouldn't need to load yarn-default.xml within the app master itself, since it would've been loaded in the client - but I'd prefer being certain of this. Alternately we can create the JobConf with a new YarnConfiguration as the parameter., bq, Vinod, instead of replacing YarnConfiguration with JobConf in the app master, can this change be localized. i.e. use a JobConf object only when initializing the OutputCommitter.
JobConf is heavy, I didn't want to clone another one unnecessarily.

Good point. Don't know if something in MRAppMaster uses stuff in YarnConfiguration, but doing what you are suggesting to be safe., Updated patch to address Sid's comment., +1, subject to nothing being reported by jenkins., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
