[Also, the doc (hadoop_archives.xml) is out-dated.  It does not mention the -p option., this patch includes the doc changes that went missing because of the split and docs removed from common which should have been moved to mapreduce., It is not clear about the file permission of har in the doc.  We should clarify that
- the original file permissions will be lost, and
- the required permission setting in order to share har to other users
