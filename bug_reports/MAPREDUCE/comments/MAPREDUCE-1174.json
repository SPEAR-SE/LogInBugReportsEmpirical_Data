[This patch puts in a foundation for quoting by providing {{escapeTableName()}} and {{escapeColumnName()}} methods in ConnManager; the default implementation does not change the literal strings passed in. ConnManager implementations now use these when putting user-provided table/column names in sql strings.

MySQLManager has been changed to use {{`backticks`}} to quote table and column names. This does not work with HSQLDB; the default non-quoting implementation is used instead.

New test case demonstrates the ability to import tables/columns with reserved words in mysql. Ran locally; passes., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
