This message is automatically generated., A grep for deprecated code might identify more, but those fixed here were my primary concern., Looks good, can you also fix the example in the class' javadoc to not use the deprecated constructor?, Thanks for the review, [~vinodkv]. The issue of the example was reported by MAPREDUCE-5346 and I uploaded a patch there. Should I merge these two patches?, Oh, yeah. Let's do it and close MAPREDUCE-5346 as duplicate., Merged the two patches., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
