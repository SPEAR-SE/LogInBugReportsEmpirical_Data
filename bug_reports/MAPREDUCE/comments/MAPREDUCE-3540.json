This message is automatically generated., Is the unix version of whoami not available on Cygwin? Looks like you are trying to convert the Windows whoami CR/LF to Unix., There is a version there but it outputs the CR/LF. Note that this is a copy-paste of the same workaround in hadoop-common-project/hadoop-common/dev-support/saveVersion.sh, +1 for this patch.

It works on my windows environment (using cygwin)., This patch also works my windows env.
Thanks for the patch., Hi Alejandro, Could you please take a look for committ?

This message is automatically generated., Will someone please review and commit this patch? It's a super minor issue, but super annoying., Thanks Trevor for updating the patch.

This message is automatically generated., Yes, if you use the Windows {{whoami}}, it has a newline at the end. A workaround is to put the Cygwin {{bin}} directory before {{Windows\System32}} in your {{PATH}}, but it's helpful to include that in this fix., The patch worked for me as well. Can some committers have a look at it pls?, Hi Anoop, you no longer need to run from Cygwin shell to be able to compile and run Hadoop on Windows (this is post HADOOP-8562 merge). Check BUILDING.txt for instructions on how to compile natively on Windows. , This Jira seems outdated now that Hadoop can be compiled on Windows without Cygwin. Should we resolve this Jira?, Dropping fix-version from 'non-fixed' (didn't have code-fixes) JIRAs.]
