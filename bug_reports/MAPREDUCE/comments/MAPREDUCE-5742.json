This message is automatically generated., The added patch seems invalid at line 10, which should have a space for the blank line.
I think it is better to use the default constructor if the SecureRandom.getInstance throws NoSuchAlgorithmException.
I like chaining methods for a builder, but up to you :)

This message is automatically generated., Reviews please?, I think it is better to use the default constructor as safety net, such as:

{code}
SecureRandom rand;
try {
  rand = SecureRandom.getInstance(...);
} catch (NoSuchAlgorithmException e) {
  rand = new SecureRandom();
}
{code}
, Thank you for taking this JIRA, [~avinz50], [~ikeda].
Minor points:

1. It's useful to make algorithms configurable. 
2. How about calling LOG.warn() when specified algorithms doesn't exist?, made changes]
