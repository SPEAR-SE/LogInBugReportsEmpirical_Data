[Patch to prefer reuse over creation of JVMs, Jonathon, have you tried this against 0.20.203 or 0.20.204? Thanks., We're actually using Cloudera's distribution (CDH3u1); I'm not sure how that matches to the official Apache versions. , AFAIK, CDH has a very stale CapacityScheduler... hard to help., Noted, but regarding the {{JvmManager}}, is there any good reason that the creation of a new JVM should be preferred over the reuse of an existing idle one (for the same job) when JVM reuse is enabled?, CDH's capacity scheduler is actually up to date with branch-0.20-security with the exception of MAPREDUCE-2729, Sorry, didn't realize that.

IAC, JVM reuse has had a history of problems - we switched it off at Yahoo a while ago. It had issues with security, logs (MAPREDUCE-1100) etc.]
