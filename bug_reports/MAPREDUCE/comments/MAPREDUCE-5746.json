[Looks like this is fallout from MAPREDUCE-5317.  The job now can linger a bit when it fails to wait for all the tasks to complete.  This can cause other task failure events to be written to the job history file, and the history server job parser currently assigns the last task failed event as the reason the job failed.  It should be reporting the first one rather than the last one., Simple patch to report the first task that failed rather than the last.  Needs a test case., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Jason. The patch looks good to me. +1. 
, Just committed to trunk and branch-2.

[~jlowe] - wanted to commit to branch-0.23 as well, but didn't know how to handle the CHANGES.txt for that. What do we do when committing to branch-0.23? , SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #5155 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/5155/])

, Attaching a branch-0.23 version of the v2 patch since the original doesn't apply cleanly to branch-0.23.

The 0.23.x section of CHANGES.txt is very wrong in trunk/branch-2 because it hasn't been properly maintained.  We do a lot of backporting of fixes to branch-0.23, and it's a lot of noise to commit CHANGES.txt updates to trunk and all the branch-2 flavors each time.  So for now we update CHANGES.txt in branch-0.23 manually when committing to branch-0.23., +1 for the branch-0.23 patch as well. 

Thanks for the explanation, Jason. Mind taking care of the branch-0.23 commit then? , Thanks for the review, Karthik!  I committed this to branch-0.23 as well., SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #480 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/480/])
