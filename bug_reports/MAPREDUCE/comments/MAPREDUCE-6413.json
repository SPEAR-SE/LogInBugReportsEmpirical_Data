[This appears to have been broken by MAPREDUCE-6238.  The test is using a hardcoded "hdfs://testcluster" default fs path which is going to try to do a lookup on a bogus hostname.

[~zxu] can you take a look?, Hi [~jlowe], thanks for reporting this issue. I did a little bit of study, I find out this test is broken by YARN-3835.
Because this test depends on the configuration "hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip" which is set at core-site.xml
{code}
  <property>
    <name>hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip</name>
    <value>false</value>
  </property>
{code}

I can think of two ways to fix this issue:
# Use MiniDFSCluster instead of a dummy unknown cluster (hdfs://testcluster)
# Set "hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip" configuration to false or call {{SecurityUtil.setTokenServiceUseIp(false);}}
Option 1 seems better to me, because we can remove the dependency on "hadoop.security.token.service.use_ip" configuration., I uploaded a patch MAPREDUCE-6413.000.patch, which uses the first approach., \\

This message was automatically generated., Thanks for picking this up, [~zxu].

Do we even need to bother with HDFS?  MiniDFSCluster makes every test it's a part of noticeably slower, and I'm not seeing why we need it here.  I got the impression "hdfs://testcluster" was just some bogus input anyway, so can we just use something "file:///" instead?  This is the default, and we're already relying on other defaults like mapreduce.framework.name=local.

As an aside, I'd personally prefer we explicitly set the values we expect to be using in unit tests, even if they're the default, for two reasons: 1) document the setup/reqs of the test and 2) protect the test from custom confs appearing in HADOOP_CONF_DIR when the test is run.
, [~jlowe], thanks for the review. That is a good suggestion, instead of using "file:///", I use "hdfs://localhost:9000" because using "file:///"  can't verify MAPREDUCE-6238.
bq. As an aside,......
agreed.
I uploaded a new patch MAPREDUCE-6413.001.patch, Please review it., \\

This message was automatically generated., I think using localhost can work.  If you agree we shouldn't rely on implicit defaults to test what we think we're testing, could you also update the test to explicitly set mapreduce.framework.name to local?, Yes, I uploaded a new patch MAPREDUCE-6413.002.patch, which addressed your comment. Please review it, thanks for the thorough review!, +1 pending Jenkins., \\
