Will run a cluster manually and report., Verified on a pseudo-distributed cluster that the running maps and running reduces are being reported. Without this patch, they were zero. The patch uses {{#getMapSchedulable()}}, {{#getReduceSchedulable()}}, and {{#getRunningTasks()}} methods - existing tests use this methods and thereby validate their behavior., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
