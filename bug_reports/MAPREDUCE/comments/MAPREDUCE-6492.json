Prepatch is due to build issue i think.., Thanks for the report and patch, Bibin!  Looks like this was caused by MAPREDUCE-5982, sorry for missing this in the review.

As for the patch, we don't want to check for the UNASSIGNED state explicitly, as I believe this can also happen if we transition from other states that also don't have a container, like the NEW state.  Probably best to skip creating the event when launch time is zero and container is null rather than checking for explicit states., Thnks for review

{quote}
you meant skip creating {{TaskAttemptImpl#sendLaunchedEvents}} in {{sendJHStartEventForAssignedFailTask}} when launch time is zero and container is null rt?, Yeah, we can just protect sendJHStartEventForAssignedFailTask to do nothing if container is null., \\

, Does this issue exist in 2.6.x? Should this be backported to branch-2.6?, This was caused by MAPREDUCE-5982 which isn't in branch-2.6.  So this isn't needed for 2.6.x unless we want to pull back that other one., I committed this to branch-2.6 since MAPREDUCE-5982 was also backported to 2.6.]
