[add in the finalStatus query parameter to RM apps api and re-orders a bit so we only create appinfo object if we really need to, I also added in a state query parameter for history server jobs api., +1 the patch looks good.

I put this into branch-0.23, branch-2 and trunk., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2048 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2048/])

, I don't know whether I can comment here or not (as the jira has already been closed), but here is my observation from the patch

{code:title=RMWebServices.java|borderStyle=solid}
if (finalStatusQuery != null && !finalStatusQuery.isEmpty()) {
       FinalApplicationStatus.valueOf(finalStatusQuery);
        if (!rmapp.getFinalApplicationStatus().toString()
            .equalsIgnoreCase(finalStatusQuery)) {
          continue;
        }
      }
{code} 

From the above code, I think the following statement
{noformat}FinalApplicationStatus.valueOf(finalStatusQuery);{noformat}
validates whether a given string is one of the FinalApplicationStatus's enum types.If the enum type is in uppercase and user has given the same enum type in lowercase, this statement throws *IllegalArgumentException*. 

However, in the next statement we are comparing strings using *equalIgnoreCase*, so from this, I *assume* that, finalStatusQuery can also be given in a lowercase. But it won't work.

Please ignore this comment, if my observation is wrong., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build #217 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-0.23-Build/217/])

, You are correct in that it will not work for lower case values.  equalsIgnoreCase is not needed, it could have been just equals.  It does work as intended/documented though.  We could change it to accept lower case if that is preferable.


documentation states: 
the job state - valid values are: NEW, INITED, RUNNING, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, KILL_WAIT, KILLED, ERROR
The final status of the application if finished - reported by the application itself - valid values are: UNDEFINED, SUCCEEDED, FAILED, KILLED
