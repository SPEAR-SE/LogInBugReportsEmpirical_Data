[Alejandro, 
  Is there a list of jira's regarding distribution/build that we need to keep track to backport to 0.23 once everything stabilizes on trunk? It might make be easier to create a uber task and mark these jiras as sub tasks to keep track of what jira's are needed for mavenization/dist fixes in 0.23?

, I'll open a JIRA to keep track of the Maven related JIRAs to backport to 0.23. Doing subtasks is not feasible because subtasks cannot span across projects., Sounds good!, Duplicate of MAPREDUCE-3366. Looks like Eric has a patch on that jira., Duplicate of MAPREDUCE-3366.]
