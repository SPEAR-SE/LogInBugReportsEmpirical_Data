[Uploading a patch that cancels the delegation tokens asynchronously as well.  This required modifying CleanupQueue to accept delegation tokens to cancel in addition to files to delete.

This message is automatically generated., LGTM, any chance to have a testcase? Else ensure it works in a secure setup as expected?, Verified it on a secure cluster, [~sandyr] Wouldn't it be simpler to just pass in the delegation token to the PathCleanupContext and get it to (optionally) cancel the token inline i.e. after the delete?, [~sandyr] This is the fix I had in mind. LMK what you think. Thanks., I considered that, and my thought for the separate async call was that I didn't see the token cancellation as related to deletions in a general sense.  But your approach seems reasonable to me too, and has the advantage of stirring up less code, so +1.

Nit: it might be good to add a comment to the new PathDeletionContext that explains what it's used for and makes it clear that the token cancellation comes after the deletion., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
