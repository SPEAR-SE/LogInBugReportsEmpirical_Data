This message is automatically generated., It seems that there is something wrong with current trunk, recent PreCommit builds from #303~#320 all failed.
https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/, Changes:
1. removeMap()removes the map from the cache if index information for this map is loaded(size>0), index information entry in cache will not be removed if it is in the loading phrase(size=0), this prevents corruption of totalMemoryUsed
2. add checkTotalMemoryUsed() in IndexCache to check consistency, this is only used in unit test.
3. add a unit test to construct the race condition, the test failed against current trunk code, and patched version passed the case on my computer.

The failed test(TestMRCLI) posted by HadoopQA was not caused by this patch. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
