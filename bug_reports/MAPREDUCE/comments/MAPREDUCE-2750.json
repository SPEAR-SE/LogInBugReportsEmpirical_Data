Is there a reason someone would want to run multiple NodeManagers on a single host in a production environment?
Two cases where I need this: (1) for benchmarks where I want to run many nodemanagers on a single node and (2) tests so that multiple NMs can be started in MiniYARNClusters.

Any down-sides to this? I know Steve mentioned firewall issues, anything else too?

Thanks for that idea, that could work if we deem ephemeral ports as too limiting., So basically the argument for ephemeral ports is that it is too hard to provide different config files to run the 2+ services on the same box for testing? 

I would think for testing predictability would be a great quality to have...

But yes, out of the box this needs to have fix port for production purposes. (... and not 8080! That's just stunningly bad.)  For testing, it makes sense to provide a different config that turns on ephemeral-ness if that is really desired.  (Which doesn't make sense to me at all, but whatever.), Patch to fix this clubbed with MAPREDUCE-2986. Up for review., Based on the above discussion, we are not changing the default ports to be ephemeral.

The test-side of things are being tracked at MAPREDUCE-2986. Closing this as duplicate.]
