[The patch adds a test case for 1.1  and 2.0 .
It also removes security on/off checks when transmitting credentials., Could I please get a review of this patch ?, I'll definitely review.  I need to make sure it doesn't collide with HADOOP-8725/HADOOP-8225., Could you please look at those jiras and explain if this patch is still needed, and if so why?  Those jiras make tokens propagate to tasks., Attaching a new patch for trunk. The previous patch simply comments out the securityenabled checks. This patch removes those checks., Thanks so much for reviewing, Daryn. 

I have reviewed HADOOP-8725/HADOOP-8225. This issue is not resolved with those patches. 

When Credentials are transmitted from Job Submitter to the tasks, there are a few other places where isSecurityEnabled check is made.
In those places, the credentials are passed further only if isSecurityEnabled is true .
This patch fixes it.

This patch also adds a test which submits a job with secrets and then verifies that secrets are available to tasks.
Without the patch, the test fails. I am attaching a patch with the test only so that the test failure can be observed.

Meanwhile I found an issue HADOOP-8225 which results in a situation in which secrets (not tokens) present in credentials are not available to MR tasks. I opened HADOOP-8726 to fix that. I attached an initial patch to unblock this issue. It will be great if you could review it.

If MAPREDUCE-4554 and HADOOP-8726 patches applied, the above mentioned test will pass.

, Attaching  a patch which has the test only so that failure can be observed. This will be removed later., bq. Credentials (secret keys) can be passed to a job via mapreduce.job.credentials.json or mapreduce.job.credentials.binary.

I don't think passing secrets them via {{mapreduce.job.credentials.binary}} ever worked?  MR code appears to explicitly pass only tokens.

Question: did HADOOP-8225 actually introduce these issues?  As best as I can tell, these are additional bugs that also aren't handled?  I presume this issue manifests only when an insecure cluster accesses a secure cluster?, It works in MR 1.0 , but coes not work in trunk as mentioned in description.

HADOOP-8225 did not introduce the problem mentioned in this issue. 
HADOOP-8225 introduced the problem mentioned in HADOOP-8276 . 

, The included test passes in 1.0 , but fails on trunk. 
The attached patch for 1.1 is a test only patch.
The patch for trunk includes test plus the required fix.
, A correction : HADOOP-8225 introduced the problem mentioned in HADOOP-8726 .
, Attaching latest patch after merging changes from trunk., Minor suggestion, in {{TaskAttemptImpl}} you could replace {{addAll}} with {{taskCredentials = new Credentials(credentials);}}.

This message is automatically generated., I am not really sure what happened here with the test failure.  The test passes for me when I run it myself.  Looking more closely at the failures, two of them seem to be because the recovery could not find the jhist file to recover from.  One of them appears to be a bit of a race, but I don't really know for sure. Either way I don't think they are caused by the patch.  I think it is more likely that they are caused by two people running the tests at the same time on the same box.  Local runner collides that way.

The patch looks OK to me for the most part.  I would like to see the comments and class names in CredentialsTestJob updated, because they still refer to sleep, almost like they were copied and pasted from sleep job.
