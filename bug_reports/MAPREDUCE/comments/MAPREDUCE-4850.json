[A patch that deletes the staging directory after the system directory.

Manual testing showed that with this patch I couldn't get a recovery failure in the scenario in the description. It would be nice to add a unit test, but I'm still trying to figure out how to write one for this.
, New patch with unit test. This depends on the fixes I made for MAPREDUCE-4859 which are not committed yet., +1, i got a bit confused by why we need to do a doAs, but mapred is not an HDFS superuser, that is way., I ran test-patch and it came back clean. I just committed this., Closed upon release of Hadoop 1.2.0.]
