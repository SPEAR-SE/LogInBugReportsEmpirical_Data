This patch fixed both the TestMROldApiJobs and TestUberAM failures mentioned in MAPREDUCE-3393.

FYI: still looking at ClassNotFound exceptions mentioned in MR-3393, however., The pom issues are due to my 'buggy' review at MAPREDUCE-3370.

I verified that TestMRjobs is failing on trunk itself. It passes with the patch. Still not sure why Jenkins isn't failing patches because of this.

The changes are fine now. +1., Thanks for the confirmation on the other two tests too, Eric!

The ClassNotFoundExceptions at MAPREDUCE-3393 should go away after this patch. It is the bind-exceptions that we should investigate.

I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23. Thanks Hitesh!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1351 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1351/])
