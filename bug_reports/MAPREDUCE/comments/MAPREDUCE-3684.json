[This patch ensures that the executor service is shut down in a finally block. I also added thread factories in LocalJobRunner and LocalDistributedCacheManager so that threads have meaningful names.

There's no unit test, but I manually verified this change by running the same Hive query against it and observing that there was no 60 second pause., I also verified that this patch resolves the problem., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me +1, thanks Tom! However I wasn't able to reproduce the issue, I tried a pi job in local mode with and without the patch and I haven't seen such delay in either case. I guess I am doing something wrong, should I see this delay with other jobs (not just hive)?, I couldn't reproduce it with a pi job either - I think Hive was triggering it since it uses the distributed cache, which in local mode is where the executor service runs and was not being properly shut down.

Thanks for the review - I will commit this soon., Thanks Tom! +1, +1, I've just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit #401 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-0.23-Commit/401/])
