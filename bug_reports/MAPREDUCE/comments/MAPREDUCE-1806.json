[Updated summary to reflect that this isn't specific to HAR. CombineFileInputFormat won't work on any FS except the default FS -- eg you can't use it against a remote cluster either., Please review this patch that preserves the original file system scheme., Can you just do fs.makeQualified(paths[i]) rather than reconstructing the Path? Also, we should have a unit test for this., Thanks for suggestions, Tom! Revised patch with the unit test is attached., one more JUnit assert to make sure there is a split, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Gera, are you working on this patch? It seems that one of the existing unit tests should also be updated.

BTW, would it be ok to backport this to branch-1 as well?, Hi Ivan, thanks for looking at the patch. I was not working on it in the meantime. Backport should be straightforward and I'll check out the failing test., It looks like this is already in branch-1 via HADOOP-7539?, Nevermind I lied, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.
