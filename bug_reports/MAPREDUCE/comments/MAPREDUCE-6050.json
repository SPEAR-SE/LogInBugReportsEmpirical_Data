[For those wanting to work on this, here's a good way to locate the tests under hadoop-mapreduce-project sub-dir: {{grep "extends TestCase" -RF .}}, Thank you for the suggestion, [~qwertymaniac]. , [~kelwyj] do you have plans to work on this?  If not, I will plan to start progress on this.  It would seem subtasks would be a good idea here to keep code review sane., Attaching what a migration for one file would look like.  It won't be as simple as a regex to replace 'extends TestCase' with some JUnit 4 annotations as there are some real differences in the test cases occasionally.  I'd propose breaking this into at least 10 subtasks since a quick count of the number of files to modify is about 168 on trunk currently., [~cote] thank you for starting this jira.

It helps committers to review your patch easily. Looking forward to your contribution., Committed MAPREDUCE-6543. Now the number of files to modify is about 16.
{code}
$ grep "extends TestCase" -RF . | wc -l
      16
{code}, All the sub-tasks were fixed. Closing.]
