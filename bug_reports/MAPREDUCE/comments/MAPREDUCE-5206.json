[Trivial fix. This one is not worth adding an elaborate unit test w.r.t the fix., The fix ensures that a job isn't added twice to retiredJobs - the issue is that there is code to not do it, but that code is not triggered due to a wrong check which I've separated from the path which retires a job see iff a user has too many completed jobs., +1

Deployed a cluster with this patch and i no longer saw same job repeated in retired jobs., Thanks for checking on this [~arpitgupta]!

I just committed this. ]
