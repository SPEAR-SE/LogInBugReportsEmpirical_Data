[
This issue is coming due to the changes of MAPREDUCE-2965. 


{code:title=NodeId.java |borderStyle=solid}
public boolean equals(Object obj) {
    if (this == obj)
      return true;
    if (!super.equals(obj))
      return false;
    if (getClass() != obj.getClass())
      return false;
    NodeId other = (NodeId) obj;
    if (!this.getHost().equals(other.getHost()))
      return false;
    if (this.getPort() != other.getPort())
      return false;
    return true;
  }
{code}

Here the super.equals(obj) is always returning false, nodeId are becoming not equal even if the states are equal. 

RMNode rmNode = this.rmContext.getRMNodes().get(nodeId) in ResourceTrackerService.java is always returning null, even if the node was registered already and it is causing to log continuously in resource manager logs. Due to this submitted application progress is always 0.
, Oh dear. Blame this on sloppy review.

Devaraj (K), can you quickly provide a patch please? Do add a test inline with TestContainerId, I think the absence of the test is a culprit too.

Thanks!, I will upload the patch now as soon as possible., Updated patch with the testcase. , +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
