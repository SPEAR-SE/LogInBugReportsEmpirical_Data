[Attaching patch with the trivial fix., Hi RaviG! Assigning back to you! I was wondering if Task20LineHistoryEventEmitter should not parse the failedDueToAttempt as well? I used your patch, and a problematic jobhistory file was succesfully converted to a trace file. However, will using a null cause any problems later while running the trace?, There should not be any issues later. Gridmix ran fine with the trace generated by Rumen(using this patch)., -1 overall.
