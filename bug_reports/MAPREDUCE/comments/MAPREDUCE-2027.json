[Some of this could be specific to Facebook, because I believe you guys have patched in LATE speculation (HADOOP-2141) onto your Hadoop 0.20, but may not have updated the scheduler bits that count speculative tasks. However, it's also possible that this issue remains in trunk., Actually, looking at trunk, the issue seems to be there too. The methods you need to fix are neededSpeculativeMaps and neededSpeculativeReduces in DefaultTaskSelector., I think it is reasonable that we just don't preempt for speculation execution. What do you think?, Scott - do you want to take care of the other issue you found (different logic for starting reducer in JIP vs. FS) in this one as well?, Joydeep: I checked the trunk code. FairScheduler uses JobInProgress.scheduleReduces() instead of its own logic. So there is no problem.]
