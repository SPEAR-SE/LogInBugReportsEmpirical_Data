[Hi Vinod,

Please refer the attachment *JobFail.PNG*.
Here the Job (WordCount) Failed as all Map Attempts were killed(intensionally) but, still the Table in UI shows 0 Killed Attempts and no reason for Failure is also available.

Request you to provide some description in the issue..., This bug is about the diagnostic information for failed tasks not appearing in the history files. The diagnostics for failed tasks appear on AM UI while the job is running.

You can try simulating a task failure by say deleting the input dir after the job starts and see the diagnostics on the AM web-UI.

The problem with the number of killed attempts if it exists is a separate issue, please open a separate ticket., Task attempt reported status doesn't contain the failed task diagnostic info, It is always empty. Task Attempt itself contains the diagnostic info for the failed tasks. I have changed it accordingly. 

I have verified it manually, it is displaying the failure info on the history UI as it displays in the AM UI. 

It is straightforward change, doesn't need new tests., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Can you debug why the diagnostics from the reportedStatus is empty? We need to make sure the remote-diagnostics are not getting lost. Otherwise, we will only see the diagnostics produce inside the AM.

Also, what is the test that you used and what is the error message that you saw?

In any case, there is one more occurrence of usage of the diagnostics-info from the 'reportedStatus' in TaskAttemptImpl.getReport(), we should fix that.

Adding a test will greatly help this. You can look at TestMRApp|TestFail|TestKill for inspiration., bq.Can you debug why the diagnostics from the reportedStatus is empty? We need to make sure the remote-diagnostics are not getting lost. Otherwise, we will only see the diagnostics produce inside the AM.

I debugged the code, reportedStatus is getting updated from the task status with statusUpdate API from the TaskUmbilicalProtocol. This task status is getting creating with empty diagnostic info(code mentioned below) and no where else it is getting updated after that.
{code:title=Task.java|borderStyle=solid}
    this.taskStatus = TaskStatus.createTaskStatus(isMapTask(), this.taskId, 
                                                  0.0f, numSlotsRequired, 
                                                  TaskStatus.State.UNASSIGNED, 
                                                  "", "", "", 
                                                  isMapTask() ? 
                                                    TaskStatus.Phase.MAP : 
                                                    TaskStatus.Phase.SHUFFLE, 
                                                  counters);

  }
{code} 

When the task fails, task is reporting using reportDiagnosticInfo from the TaskUmbilicalProtocol and same is available in the taskAttempt.

bq.Also, what is the test that you used and what is the error message that you saw?

As you have mentioned in the previous comment, deleting input file after the job starts and simulated the same. I have attached history UI screen shot for failed task after the changes.

bq.In any case, there is one more occurrence of usage of the diagnostics-info from the 'reportedStatus' in TaskAttemptImpl.getReport(), we should fix that.
I missed it. I will look into this.
bq.Adding a test will greatly help this. You can look at TestMRApp|TestFail|TestKill for inspiration.
I am very much interested to add new testcases. In this case, changes are in private method, the method present in private class and also changes are very minimal. Thanks for the information. I will add new test cases.
, bq. [..] reportedStatus is getting updated from the task status with statusUpdate API from the TaskUmbilicalProtocol. This task status is getting creating with empty diagnostic info [...]
Thanks. In that case, I suggest we completely remove TaskAttemptStatus.diagnosticInfo to avoid any confusion.

Thanks for the screenshot, but your explanation convinced me anyways.

, Updated the patch by removing TaskAttemptStatus.diagnosticInfo and added tests., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
