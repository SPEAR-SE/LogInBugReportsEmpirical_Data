[I believe this is cause the MR AM never really starts with the jobConf default of "mapred.child.env" that has LD_LIBRARY_PATH set to the right native lib area. Without that, I don't think the AM container really gets the proper native paths on its runtime?, Or well the reason I say that is the AMLauncher does not seem to be populating a LD_LIBRARY_PATH for natives, pre-launch. But I see NM launching with a proper java.library.path at least (no LD_LIBRARY_PATH though), but unsure if that is inflicted automatically onto the AM env?, Possibly related to MAPREDUCE-5799, still an issue in 2.6. I am planning on digging into this one.]
