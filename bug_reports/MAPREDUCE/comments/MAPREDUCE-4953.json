This message is automatically generated., Since hitting the bug would probably segfault the Pipes app, and the fix is trivially correct, no tests are included., looks good to me, +1, the patch looks good to me. I confirmed that this gets rid of the compiler warning.

I'm going to commit this momentarily., I've just committed this to trunk and branch-2.
