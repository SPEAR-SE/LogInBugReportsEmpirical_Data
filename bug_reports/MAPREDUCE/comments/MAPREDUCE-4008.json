[This is specific to the FifoScheduler, as the error doesn't occur when configured to use the CapacityScheduler., @Jason, You are right, It happens only for  the fifo scheduler . In the FifoScheduler.setConf() method it was registering default QueueMetrics. This setConf method is getting called twice(as part of scheduler instance creation and reinitialize()) and causing the exception logging.

I have moved the default QueueMetrics registration to reinitialize()  to call only once..

It doesn't need new tests since it is logging the exception when this issue happens.
