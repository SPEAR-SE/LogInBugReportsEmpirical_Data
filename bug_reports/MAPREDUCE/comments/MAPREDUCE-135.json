[Another point to ponder is that we might be getting too aggressive launching speculative attempts; a way around might have a larger backoff for each successive attempt; ensuring we don't launch too many of them too quickly. 

To illustrate:
task_1_0 (of tip_1) is launched
task_1_1 is launched when tip_1's progress falls behind other tips by x%
task_1_2 is launched when tip_1's progress falls behind other tips by (x + x/8)%
task_1_3 is launched when tip_1's progress falls behind other tips by (x + x/4)%
task_1_4 is launched when tip_1's progress falls behind other tips by (x + x/2)%

Thoughts?

Of course this could clearly be a future enhancement to Owen's proposal, and it makes sense to get speculative-execution working reliably for now.
, Can this be reproduced now?, I'm going to close this out as stale.  I suspect this is no longer an issue.]
