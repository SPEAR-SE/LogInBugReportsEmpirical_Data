Summary
-------

The job history server doesn't show the queue the jobwas run in. It is inserted into the job history file.

It seems like this should be part of the Job interface.

JobImpl current gets it from the job config to insert into the history.

------------------
Some more background. jobhistory/job jobs display a single CompletedJob instance which is populated by parsing the jobhistory file contents.
jobhistory/app jobs display all jobs in the history via PartialJob instances which are populated by parsing the jobhistory file names only, not by looking at the contents.

By changing the jobhistory file naming scheme, I have disabled rigid parsing of job history file names and try to get as much information from them as we can.


This addresses bug MAPREDUCE-3342.

Testing
-------

In addition to unit tests. I have manually tested coexistence of old and new job history files, both display the queue name on the jobhistory/job page correctly. On the jobhistory/app page old job history file queue names will be displayed as null and new history file queue names will be displayed correctly. 


Thanks,

Jonathan

    Could you update the comment a bit.  It kind of loses the intention to not fail if the format is not completely correct. Or just add in the try/catch blocks for the number format exception on each parse int/parselong

Going to go ahead and catch the number format exception and add a comment restating not to fail.

bq.  -------
bq.  
bq.  In addition to unit tests. I have manually tested coexistence of old and new job history files, both display the queue name on the jobhistory/job page correctly. On the jobhistory/app page old job history file queue names will be displayed as null and new history file queue names will be displayed correctly.
