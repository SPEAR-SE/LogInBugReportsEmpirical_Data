[Consider an example where the cluster has 3 tasktrackers (t1,t2 and t3) and a tip tip1 runs on t1 and fails. Now the tip1 is rescheduled on t2 and fails again. Now if tracker t1 is blacklisted, then t1 will be removed from the active tracker list. Now if tracker t2 asks for a  task, tip1 will be scheduled on it as the total count of active tracker = 2 (t2, t3) and total-tip-failures = 2 (t1, t2) is same.]
