[Changed the javadoc, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12584757/MAPREDUCE-5272-branch-1.patch
  against trunk revision .

    {color:red}-1 patch{color}.  The patch command could not apply the patch.

Console output: https://builds.apache.org/job/PreCommit-MAPREDUCE-Build/3678//console

This message is automatically generated., Committed to branch-1 as it still applied. Lets roll such changes into single, larger patches in future though, as otherwise the committing overhead appears too high given the current process.

Many thanks again Zhijie!]
