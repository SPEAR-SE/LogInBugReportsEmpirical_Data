[The name is still valid, as the history server needs to support backwards-compatibility with the old name to support history files created on an older version of Hadoop.  The parsing of the old-style name was fixed by MAPREDUCE-5939.  I don't think there's anything that needs to be fixed here, but please correct me if I'm missing something., Thanks [~jlowe], the name is still valid only for compatibility. Will it be better if we use the new name and let the designated UT to cover this backwards-compatibility?, Sure, we can update it I guess.  However there are a lot more important items to tackle than fixing a unit test that isn't broken. ;-), Resolving per Jason's earlier comment. Separate JIRA can be filed if the unit test needs an improvement (vs. the reported bug here).]
