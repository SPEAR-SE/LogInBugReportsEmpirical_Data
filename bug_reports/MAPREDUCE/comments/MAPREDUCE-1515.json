[This patch just passes the variables down to the subant call., +1, Sorry, i didn't mean to resolve it .. *smile*, This patch allows a local Ant properties file to be read from the imported build file, build-utils.xml. This removes the need to pass properties required by both the top-level and imported build file on the command-line Ant invocation using the -D switch.

It differs from the previous patch in that the entire contents of the properties file are read in, whereas the previous patch only sets the required properties (java5.home and forrest.home) based on their settings in the top-level build script. If any other properties are later needed these will need to be added into the imported build script (i.e., build-utils.xml).

This patch only reads the build.properties from the local directory (the hadoop-mapreduce root directory). This differs from the top-level Ant file which also will look for build properties in the user's home directory., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Al, Can you just delete the line out of build-utils.xml instead of commenting it out? Other than that, either solution is fine., This revision of the patch cleans dead wood comments from the patch as Owen suggested, and adjusted error messages to indicate a property can be set at Ant command line or in build properties file. , -1 overall.

I committed this. Thanks, Al!, +1 

Just patched my version of CDH3 Beta 3, and tried to recreate this issue. I could not. The patch looks good to me.,
