[need to investigate, bq. We ran a job with the wrong file, then around 50 minutes later we put the fixed version into DFS, and ran the same job again.

Just to clarify: so it was the 2nd job which had these exceptions? And the 3rd job succeeded? (same code, different jobids), This should be fixed in the current trunk. please reopen if not..]
