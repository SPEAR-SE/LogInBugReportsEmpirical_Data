Should replace getClass().getName() to getSimpleName for ensuring things don't break on Windows

, Can we have this in 2.0.4-alpha?  It was suggested by [~sseth] after he grokked how hbase runs its mapreduce unit tests.  Thanks., I will commit in a day or so unless someone does it before me or unless objection. Thanks., @Stack, I will be committing shortly to branch-2.0.4., Minor clarification - changes.txt was modified in branch-2 and branch-2.0.4 - trunk has some additional mayhem to clear out first.]
