[IMO we should move streaming to core in its current state, since it has long been working well for users. We can have follow up issues to tackle the improvements listed in the description.

I suggest that we move it into a library source tree (MAPREDUCE-1478) so that it's impossible to inadvertently introduce dependencies in core on streaming.
