Could you please add this as diff to https://reviews.apache.org/r/11456/
I tried, but failed,

"The file 'hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient/src/test/java/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/TestLineRecordReader.java' (r69253f4) could not be found in the repository", [~gelesh],

The url you mentioned(https://reviews.apache.org/r/11456/) cannot be seen from me, because I don't have permissions - the page says that "You don't have access to this review request".

Do you mean that my patch format is wrong?, I cannot see the page of Review Board although I've logined. Therefore, I've sent the patch itself to Gelesh via email., Add a test case for compressed input files to o.a.h.mapreduce.lib.input.TestLineRecordReader, because I forgot to update in the last patch., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~gelesh]: I found that the reason my patch cannot be uploaded is diff format. I've used "git diff" command to create patches, but review board doesn't accept it. https://code.google.com/p/reviewboard/issues/detail?id=1918, [~gelesh], I could create the review request on Review board. https://reviews.apache.org/r/12892/
