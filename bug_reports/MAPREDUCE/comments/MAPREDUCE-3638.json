[This looks like a very long-standing bug, this code hasn't changed since 2009..., I did some more follow up testing on this and I think I know more precisely where the problem is. 

1) The failure occurs when running a streaming job with the -cacheFile option on a local file system using file:///<path>. 
2) I ran hdfs dfs -ls file:///<path> to make sure the file exists. 
3) I ran the same streaming job using the same value from 1). But instead of using the deprecated -cacheFile option, I used -files instead. The job ran and passed. 

So is seems when running the streaming job using the deprecated option -cacheFile on a local file system, it is not getting the correct file permission on it. 
, Thanks Philip! Thats helpful. Given that we have a workarnd to use -files (and also -files is the more prominent usage in streaming), I think this might not be that urgent to fix. , It's not urgent. We do have 4 regression tests blocked by this, so it would be good to have this fixed at some point in the near future. Thanks!, cacheFile for local FS was never supported. cacheFile downloads files from HDFS only. This is a deprecated option and files option has to be used for downloading files from local FS. This is not an issue., Thanks Ramya. Resolving this.]
