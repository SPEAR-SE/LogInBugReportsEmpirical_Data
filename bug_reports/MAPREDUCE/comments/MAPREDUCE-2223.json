[This is counterpart of HDFS-1406. However the fix is a way smaller., +1, Considering that the change is _very_ isolated and doesn't touch any source code I have ran affected test only

and am going to commit it unless somebody has objection., I have also ran test-patch locally:

-1 overall.  

    +1 @author.  The patch does not contain any @author tags.

    +1 tests included.  The patch appears to include 3 new or modified tests.

    +1 javadoc.  The javadoc tool did not generate any warning messages.

    +1 javac.  The applied patch does not increase the total number of javac compiler warnings.

    -1 findbugs.  The patch appears to introduce 13 new Findbugs warnings.

    -1 release audit.  The applied patch generated 2 release audit warnings (more than the trunk's current 1 warnings).

    +1 system test framework.  The patch passed system test framework compile.

2 release audit warnings are because of missed licenses smoke-tests and robots.txt files (see HDFS-1511 for correct fix of the problem). FindBugs are legit but unrelated to the patch. Mapreduce trunk needs to be fixed wrt static analysis warnings., I have just committed this., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #563 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/563/])
