This message is automatically generated., +1, committing., Committed to branch-1 and branch-1.0. Thanks Kihwal!, Sorry about this, but since branch-1 commit message failed to carry the JIRA ID, so here's the revision it went in as: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1331686 (r1331686).

The branch-1.0 revision is r1331687 instead., Since it is in both branch-1 and branch-1.0, only need to tag "Fix Version" as 1.0.3.  Thanks!, Closed upon release of Hadoop-1.0.3.]
