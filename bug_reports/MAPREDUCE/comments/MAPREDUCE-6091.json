This message is automatically generated., Fixed TestNonExistentJob (restored the old test). The other failures appear unrelated to this patch (it's reproducible on the trunk).
, This patch pretty much restores the old behavior of ClientServiceDelegate. If the job does not exist either in the RM or in the job history server, ClientServiceDelegate.getJobStatus() would return null. The job history client returns null if the job does not exist in the job history server., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
