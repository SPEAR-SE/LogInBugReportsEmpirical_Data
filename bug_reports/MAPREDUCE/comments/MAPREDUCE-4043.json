[The tasks can workaround the problem by reading the appTokens file that was pushed to HDFS when the job was launched.  For example:

{code}
    Credentials cred = Credentials.readTokenStorageFile(new Path(jobConf.get("mapreduce.job.dir"), "appTokens"), jobConf);
    byte[] secretKey = cred.getSecretKey(SECRET_KEY_ALIAS);
{code}, Can you please check and see if the patch for MAPREDUCE-3727 is the cause? I remember something like this, credentials being removed from the client as one of the proposals there. Don't have bandwidth to confirm this myself. Thanks., I don't believe MAPREDUCE-3727 is relevant as the property being unset in that change needs to be set by the job submitter and that's not happening in this case.

I believe the keys are dropped by tasks because the TaskImpl/TaskAttemptImpl constructors take a collection of tokens instead of credentials.  Therefore when the map and reduce tasks attempts are constructed by the AM, it ends up dropping the keys out of the credentials since there's only parameters to pass tokens.

Here's a patch that changes the collection of tokens argument to credentials, which contain tokens and secret keys.  Manual testing with a toy job that sends a secret key works.  Needs unit tests., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

It occurred to me that we may want to file a followup JIRA to clean up a few things.

* It seems unnecessary to pass the job token and credentials separately when we always combine the job token into the credentials before building the container launch context.
* It's unclear to me whether we still need the appTokens file that is placed into HDFS by the job submitter, localized by the NM, and finally read in by the AM.  I believe the AM's credentials sent in the AM's container launch context already contains the same information., +1 Patch looks pretty straight-forward.  Minor comment is {{JobImpl}} appears to be naming the credentials as fsTokens., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me +1 and it looks simple enough.  But I don't understand the tokens in yarn enough to really feel comfortable with just checking it in myself so I have added Vinod on to the watch list. , Vinod, we need this asap. Please comment, I got word form Vinod that he is OK with the change, and I can go ahead and check it in.  If there is anything else that comes up later it can be done in a follow on JIRA. So I will put it in., confirming, Thanks Jason,
