[Attaching proposed patch, Is this still an issue?  I'm not familiar with the C++ code in question--where does it live?

The patch looks fine as far as it goes (other than the lack of path info in the filenames), but I'm kind of amazed it ever compiled in the first place.  Is SerialUtils.hh not actually included in SerialUtils.cc?  Does Hudson even look at this stuff, wherever it lives?, Patch for current trunk@1004113, Attaching patch for current trunk, As suggested on the mapreduce-dev mailing list, I'm attaching results from my local test-patch run:

This message is automatically generated., Looks like some tests failed due to timeout.  Those tests have nothing to do with this patch, anyway., This is a sort of incompatible change - some user might be explicitly declaring the extern void deserializeFloat(float &t, InStream &stream), right?

Do we need to leave the old version around for a version? Perhaps someone who makes use of SerialUtils can comment - I never have worked on significant amounts of C++ code with Hadoop, In [Pydoop|http://pydoop.sourceforge.net] we are currently patching SerialUtils.cc at compile time, before building the Python extension with Boost., Sorry to come in late, the patch has gone stale. Can you please rebase? Thanks.
