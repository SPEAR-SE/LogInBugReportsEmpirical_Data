[Could you please share how is it impacting ?, [~gelesh]
Map task will choose the splill file dir on local disks according to the estimating size if there are mutliple local dirs configuraed. The wrong estimating size may cause a wrong decision such as choosing the smaller space dir according to the give size (the wrong one) while the actual spill is larger and thus cause disk full error, although there may be another disk dir with enough space available.
, Patch for fixing the problem attached.

Change from "(bufvoid - bufend) + bufstart" to "(bufvoid - bufstart) + bufend" and add test case for detecting invalid estimation size as for the case of bufend < bufstart, (bufvoid - bufend) + bufstart will greater than bufvoid.

Please kindly help review the patch., [~jerrychenhf]
