[I originally opened this to track performance fixes before we could call MRv2 on YARN production ready. Things have been good since..
 - As new issues come in, we can open new tickets.
 - Will leave the open sub-tasks as they are.
 - No fix-version as this was done across releases.

Resolving this umbrella JIRA. ]
