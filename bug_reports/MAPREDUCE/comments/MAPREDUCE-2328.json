This message is automatically generated., Justification: I believe this is mostly a doc-fix patch, and I've verified that no existing default-loading tests fail, as well as double checked the entered property names for typos/exact matches. The defaults were taken from the code's use of them around MR's code base., Seems we are still missing mapreduce.map.memory.mb, mapreduce.map.memory.physical.mb, etc from mapred-default.xml.

I think the descriptions could also be improved. Take a look at src/docs/src/documentation/content/xdocs/cluster_setup.xml in the common repo for pretty good descriptions, as well as [this comment|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HADOOP-5881?focusedCommentId=12712751&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels:comment-tabpanel#comment-12712751]., Thanks Todd. I'll put up a fixed patch shortly., New patch with additions and docs improvement based on Todd's comments and links (and mechanisms of how the cluster-wide properties are utilized.), -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Sorry to come in late, the patch has gone stale. Can you please rebase? Thanks.
, Sorry to come even later. 
This does apply to 0.22 and would be good to have it in the release. 
But a patch for trunk is needed., I committed this to 0.22 branch. Thank you Harsh.
Leaving it open for the action on trunk / 0.23, Hello,

Heading to rebase this. Would all of these properties still be valid on 0.23?, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch #85 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-22-branch/85/])
    MAPREDUCE-2328. Add memory-related configuration parameters to mapred-default.xml. Contributed by Harsh J.

shv : http://svn.apache.org/viewcvs.cgi/?root=Apache-SVN&view=rev&rev=1190173
Files : 
* /hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.22/mapreduce/CHANGES.txt
* /hadoop/common/branches/branch-0.22/mapreduce/src/java/mapred-default.xml
, Only mapreduce.map.memory.mb and mapreduce.reduce.memory.mb are relevant in 23. The others are now yarn configs and have different names., MAPREDUCE-3223 first needs to go in. Then this may be revisited., Ping.  This should probably get committed now, yes?, This should be closed out as Invalid. I don't seem to have the rights to this JIRA anymore though, so am unable to close it out.]
