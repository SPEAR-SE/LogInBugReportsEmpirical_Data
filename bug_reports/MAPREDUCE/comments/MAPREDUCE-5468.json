[It's got more to do with AM recovery itself. I observed this a while ago when browsing MR app code, but forgot to file the ticket., Are there logs from the AM attempts when this occurred?  Last I checked, the AM will recover map tasks if they completed before the AM restarted., Here's a simple patch fixing it.

The newly added test-case passes with the code fix and fails without.

Also did a single node test which illustrated that recovery of maps-only jobs resumes progress now., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
