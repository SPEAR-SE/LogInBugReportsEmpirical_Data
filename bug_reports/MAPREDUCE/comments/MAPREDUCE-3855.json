[Hi Suresh,
I will take a look. As part of HDFS-2928, i may need to support non retry-able proxy inside ClientNamenodeProtocolTranslatorPB. As it is private, i was planning to pass the flag for retry in constructor. That may break this test. Thanks for noticing it., I just verified MAPREDUCE-3974, that will fix this issue.
Thanks Aaron for the patch, marking this as duplicate., Ah, sorry. Didn't know about this issue. Thanks for resolving this one, Uma.]
