  I think this heuristic might not work well. If you already have 20 reservations, it will take you 4000s to reserve another container. 

What we might want to try out is:

{code}
number of re reservations/number of reservations * (1 - (size of container needed/size of node))
{code}

This will penalize really huge reservations and will also provide a decent time frame on re reserving the next container.

Also, we might want to bias towards nodes not already running high RAM containers.
, Thanks for the review Mahadev - I like your heuristic better. Let me whip up a patch for that. , Updated patch to incorporate f/b from Mahadev. I've also tested on a secure cluster to ensure it fixes the corner case., +1 looks good to me.
One minor nit, the following declarations in LeafQueue do not need to be public:

{code}
  public final Resource minimumAllocation;
  public final Resource maximumAllocation;
  public final float minimumAllocationFactor;
{code} 
, Fixed the nit., I just committed this., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
