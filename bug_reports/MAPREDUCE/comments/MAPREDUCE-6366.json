[I attached a patch. Could someone review it? Thank you., Sure, let me check., [~tfukudom] thank you for reporting and taking this issue. +1, committing this shortly. 

This change looks incompatible at a glance, but it is a compatible change. This is a bug which TeraSort problem ignores mapreduce.terasort.final.sync configuration. It should be fixed. The change of the default value only affects TeraSort. The polity also describes that we can change the default value.

http://hadoop.apache.org/docs/current/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/Compatibility.html#Hadoop_Configuration_Files, Forgot to run Jenkins. Submitting a patch and pending for Jenkins., Thank you for reviewing, [~ozawa]!, \\
