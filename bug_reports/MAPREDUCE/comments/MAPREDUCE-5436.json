[I liked the idea..we should definitely not loop...there is no point as far as I see in trying to communicate back.. probably we can have something like retry policy default to < 3? and trying after waiting for a while may be a second or so?.. I am not sure but probably we should check if there is some problem with RPC and token is corrupted during transmission then we get same exception or different? if same then we should definitely try again to avoid network issues..
