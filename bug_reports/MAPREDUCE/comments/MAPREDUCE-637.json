[5819_20090515.patch: a preview patch which
- needs to be cleaned up;
- needs more code comments; and
- is not user friendly.

But it has computed the 10^15+1st bit of Ï€., 1e15.zip: log files for the computation of the 10^15+1st bit of &pi;., Deleted 1e15.zip.  The logs need to be cleaned up., 1e15log.zip: log files for the 1e15 computation., Computed the following table for the bits of &pi;:

- For each position n, except the first and the last, also computed &pi; bits at position n-4 and n+4 for correctness checking.

- Row 0 to Row 7 were run in a single computer.  A single run of Row 7 took several seconds.

- Row 8 to Row 14 were run in a 7600-cpu-core cluster.  A single run of Row 14 took 27 hours.

- Row 15 is the result reported in [the YDN blog|http://developer.yahoo.net/blogs/hadoop/2009/05/hadoop_computes_the_10151st_bi.html]., 5819_20090523.patch:
- cleaned up codes
- added some comments, 5819_20090527.patch: this patch is ready to be reviewed., Brilliant. +1

It doesn't need to delay committing this, but a document describing some of the strategies employed would help others navigate the code. The comments help, but it's hard to pick salient, general details out of the broader work (e.g. use of ClusterStatus in MixMachine, how results are combined, etc.)., m637_20090624.patch: add some comments in DistBbp and DistSum headers to give better pictures of the programs., m637_20090630.patch: fix some findbugs warnings., {noformat}

- The second part (D3611)
-* Starting at position 1,000,000,000,000,053.
-* Totally 20 bits.
-* The last bit, the 1,000,000,000,000,072nd bit, probably is the highest bits computed ever in the history.
-* Computed by totally 14,000 jobs, 7,000,000 tasks, 208 years of cpu-time and 12 days of cluster time., I have committed this., D3611.zip: logs for the D3611 computation., D3611.tar.gz: same as D3611.zip but use .tar.gz for better compression ratio.  D3611.zip was deleted., Will add more documentation in MAPREDUCE-691., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #15 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/15/])
    , Just have posted some new pi computation results in MAPREDUCE-1923.]
