[Hi,
I tested this in trunk code. Looks like the directory is getting deleted.
There is a finally block which does this
{Code}
if (status == null) {
        LOG.info("Cleaning up the staging area " + submitJobDir);
        if (jtFs != null && submitJobDir != null)
          jtFs.delete(submitJobDir, true);

      }
{Code}, Closing it as cannot reproduce. Feel free to reopen if you feel further analysis required]
