[the workaround is to set it in your .profile file. Having it set in the shell you invoke yarn from is not sufficient. , My workaround (which is more of a fix) is to allow sudo to inherit some env variables. Edit the /etc/sudoers, and enable this behaviour:

{code:none} 
Defaults	env_keep+="JAVA_HOME"
{code} 

You can alternatively enable it for a user:
{code:none} 
Defaults:myusrname	env_keep+="JAVA_HOME"
{code} , Fixed.]
