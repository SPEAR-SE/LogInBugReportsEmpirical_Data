[Moved to MR project, Anything interesting in the RM or NM logs?  That page is being served from the NM through the RM web proxy, so there are a couple of places where it could break.  Also, which version of Hadoop are you running?, No, I haven't found anything related in the logs, but debug logs are turned off...
This issue have been found in both 2.4.1 and 2.7.2.]
