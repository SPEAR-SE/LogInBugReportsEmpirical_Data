This message is automatically generated., As for the failing test, see MAPREDUCE-6094, Thanks for filing MAPREDUCE-6094, [~sjlee0], Thanks for the report and patch, Gera!  Patch looks good overall, just some minor nits:

- adding "local" to the method name (e.g.: setupDistributedCacheLocalConfig) would make it a bit clearer what the method is doing and when it should be called
- it'd be nice if the method was located in the file near the other methods related to the distributed cache for more coherency when browsing the file
- The JobConf import that was added is not needed (actually there are a number of unused imports in MRApps that would be nice to clean up)., Thanks for the review, [~jlowe]! Here is the updated v02 patch. I used a briefer name {{setupDistributedCacheLocal}} if that's ok, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

PATCH APPLICATION FAILED
{code}, I think the "cannot stat" error is benign.  The patch does not apply to trunk for me locally.
