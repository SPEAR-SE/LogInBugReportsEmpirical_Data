This message is automatically generated., MAPREDUCE-4189 covers TestContainerManagerSecurity and also shows the other test failures and preexisting., The approach for this bug was to prevent concurrent access modification issues by using a structure that supports versioning of the data. Another approach was to give a copy of the data structure at a cost of performance., The test will delete the ./target dir, which is not really something that I want removed after running tests because it may have all of my compiled .class files in it, along with who knows what else.  I would rather see something like target/<testName>/ as the testDir.

Also getGoodDirs() and getFailedDirs() are still returning internal data structures.  This is not really what this bug was trying to address because this is just to avoid a concurrent modification exception, but I is still bad practice, because I can delete an entry from the list returned and that will be reflected for all people with the list.  I would like to see the Lists returned to be immutable, or if they are changed they will have no impact on DirectoryCollection.  That can be done on a separate JIRA , Thanks for the review, Bobby. I have changed the test to put temp files in target/<testclass>/* and that dir is now cleaned up after the test class is run. Also I have changed the return type to an unmodifiableList, keeping the CopyOnWriteArrayList backing store. This prevents the ConcurrentModificationException while protecting the internal data structure from being accidentally being changed.
