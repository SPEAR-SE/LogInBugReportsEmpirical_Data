[Devaraj,

On our clusters, we get these errors because those links take us to pages served by the _TaskTracker_ instead of the JobTracker. In our setup, the machines that run the TaskTrackers aren't directly visible to the outside world (at least through the domain names used internally by Hadoop). Thus, the browser can't connect, although the JobTracker running on the admin machine can. We sometimes work around this by running a browser on the admin machine, although that is inconvenient.

Could something similar be happening in your case? Can you connect to the machines referenced in those URLs by other means, with ping or SSH for example?, In my case, While forming the urls in machines.jsp, taskdetailshistory.jsp and taskdetails.jsp pages, it is referring the host names. If we convert this host name to IP address in the urls, it works. ]
