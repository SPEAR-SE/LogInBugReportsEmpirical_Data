This message is automatically generated., No new unit tests are needed for the web page display bug.

Manual tests include 
1) verifying that all web pages with id are sorted by default on that column. 
2) visually inspecting the html output to verify jQuery column def are correct as well as aaSorting., +1, patch looks good., Just committed this. Thanks Jonathan!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1402 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1402/])
