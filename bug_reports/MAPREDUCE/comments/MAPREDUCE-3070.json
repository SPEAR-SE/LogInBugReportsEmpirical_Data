[In this case, the NM will be able to register with RM only after RM also restarts., Even if the node manager is restarted for any purpose(like cluster maintenance), NM should wait until the "yarn.resourcemanager.nm.liveness-monitor.expiry-interval-ms" which is 10 minutes by default to register. Decreasing the default time is also not feasible. 

Proposal is, 
we can cleanup and register NM even if the registration is requested before the expiry of NM., We should just assume the NM has rebooted if it registers again and cleanup existing containers etc., We need this for 0.23, setting the Fix-version.

This should be done together with MAPREDUCE-3034. We need RM side changes to help duplicate registration. And NM side changes described at MAPREDUCE-3034., Here one more problem is that, when the duplicate registration comes it is adding up the resource to cluster resource in the capacity scheduler without checking whether the nodemanager resource is already added or not., Provided patch for review.

This message is automatically generated., Hi Devaraj,
 I have raised a similiar issue [MAPREDUCE-3178|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-3178] some time back. 

 I have one doubt from the patch you have attached, pls clarify

 suppose say current thread passed {noformat}if (this.rmContext.getRMNodes().putIfAbsent(nodeId, rmNode) != null) {noformat} condition, and the next moment *ping checker* thread detected that current node has been expired and removed node from the *running* map and called event handler to handle node EXPIRE event. So corresponding Schedular removes node from *nodes* map.

 suppose now NodeReconnectedSchedulerEvent(rmNode)) has been called. As part of this, again Schedular tries to remove node from the *nodes* map and and tries to operate on that object. Result is as we know NPE.

correct me if I am wrong. 
, I think this can be simplified. We don't need 'reconnected' state.

Essentially an NM should be identified with host+port (see NodeId.hashCode).

Now on registration we can assume that host+port is unique - now the question is: why isn't this already working?

But I agree with Kamesh's observation on MAPREDUCE-3178, we need to fix that as he pointed out. 

But this should already work if the NM comes up on a different port?, Thanks Arun and Kamesh for taking look into the patch.

bq. I think this can be simplified. We don't need 'reconnected' state.
It can be simplified, will update the patch with simplified approach.

{code:title=ResourceTrackerService.java|borderStyle=solid}
      if (this.rmContext.getRMNodes().putIfAbsent(nodeId, rmNode) != null) {
        throw new IOException("Duplicate registration from the node!");
      }
{code}

If the node manager goes down, it will be removed from the this.rmContext.getRMNodes() after completion of the expiry interval(YarnConfiguration.RM_NM_EXPIRY_INTERVAL_MS). Before completion of expiry interval if the same node manager comes up in the same port, RM throws IO exception saying "Duplicate registration from the node!" and NM fails to start with the same reason. 

bq. But I agree with Kamesh's observation on MAPREDUCE-3178, we need to fix that as he pointed out. 

It can be handled, will handle in the next patch.

bq. But this should already work if the NM comes up on a different port?

Yes, It works fine., Ok, seems to me that the bug is in our default config.

In YarnConfiguration:

{code:title=YarnConfiguration.java|borderStyle=solid}
  public static final String DEFAULT_NM_ADDRESS = "0.0.0.0:45454";
{code}

If we change it to 0.0.0.0:0 i.e. let the OS pick an ephemeral port we don't need any further changes. Thoughts?, It solves this problem if we change it to use ephemeral port. I will provide patch with this change.

This can be improved further for the feature releases. , Thanks.

Can you please fix MAPREDUCE-3178 while you are at this, we can do it in this patch itself., After the updated patch for MAPREDUCE-2775, MAPREDUCE-3178 will not be a problem. I will verify that scenario once again as part of MAPREDUCE-2775., No, you still need to check if nodeId exists before you create RMNodeImpl, else MAPREDUCE-3178 will bite us and CS will have wrong resource/node count., Before the patch MAPREDUCE-2775, it adds the resources in schedulers when we create a node(RMNodeImpl). RMNode was getting creating before checking whether it present or not in this.rmContext.getRMNodes().

{code:title=RMNodeImpl.java|borderStyle=solid}


public RMNodeImpl(NodeId nodeId, RMContext context, String hostName,
      int cmPort, int httpPort, Node node, Resource capability) {
    .......
    .......
    context.getDispatcher().getEventHandler().handle(
        new NodeAddedSchedulerEvent(this));
  }


As part of the MAPREDUCE-2775 patch, this event handling will be removed from RMNodeImpl. Same will be done as part of AddNodeTransition which occurs when the STARTED event triggers. This event is triggering only when the node isn't present in this.rmContext.getRMNodes().


{code:title=ResourceTrackerService.java|borderStyle=solid}
       if (this.rmContext.getRMNodes().putIfAbsent(nodeId, rmNode) != null) {
         throw new IOException("Duplicate registration from the node!");
       }
+      
+      this.rmContext.getDispatcher().getEventHandler().handle(
+          new RMNodeEvent(nodeId, RMNodeEventType.STARTED));
 
{code}, I updated the patch for default configuration. After this patch and MAPREDUCE-2775 changes, MAPREDUCE-3178 will not be an issue., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
