[Marked this a critical as data loss is serious.  Mark can you post your patch?, I confess I'm not terribly familiar with git, so this is just a "git diff"., I was able to reproduce the issue, and I have updated the test case to reproduce it as well.  The original test case did not check the last split, I don't know why.  I also found out that this exists in branch-1 as well. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good to me I am +1 on it, but I added in the test, so if someone else could take a look I would appreciate it., Nasty.  Could you please port to branch-1 and I'll include it in the next release?, Patch for branch-1.  The patch is identical to the one for trunk except for line numbers and the location of the files., Also now that I think about it more this really is a Blocker, not a critical., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., +1, thanks Mark and Bobby.  Bobby or Matt, feel free to commit., Thanks Mark,

This is a great catch, I just wish we had found it sooner.  I put this into trunk, branch-2, branch-0.23, branch-1, and branch-1.1.

If I missed any branches that people want it in please let me know and I will see what I can do., Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #2988 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/2988/])
