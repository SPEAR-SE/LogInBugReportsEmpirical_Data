[
The remaining codes in contrib/stream are still not up to Hadoop standard and need further 
clean up/refactoring before we can move them to the Hadoop main.  JIRA-1329 was created for 
this purpose. It is fine if somebody goes ahead to fix the specific problems raised in the current JIRA.
Otherwise,  the problems of this kind sould be fixed as a part of JIRA-1329.
