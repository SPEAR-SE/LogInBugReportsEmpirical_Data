[Prior to MAPREDUCE-5196, tasks could ping the AM or provide a status update to the AM.  The former was a sanity check to make sure the AM is still present, while the latter was used to indicate some progress had been made on the task's end.  Therefore a task that was still pinging but taking too long to send status updates would be detected as a hung task by the AM and the task killed.

Now the AM treats both pings and status updates as progress on the tasks side, which means a task that hangs while processing data but stays alive enough to keep pinging will just keep running and the AM will never timeout the task., Patch to not report a task is progressing if the status update doesn't provide status (i.e.: is really a ping)., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
