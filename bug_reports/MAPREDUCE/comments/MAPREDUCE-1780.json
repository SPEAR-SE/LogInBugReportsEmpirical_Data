[Attaching patch for trunk.

This patch should go in after HADOOP-6715. This depends on the changes done in HADOOP-6715 to AccessControlList.toString() and AccessControlList.getAclString()., Some comments:
 - JobSubmittedEvent is used to persist job-acls to JobHistory but the acls are incorrectly written through toString() method. Please add a test/modify the existing test in TestJobHistory to verify this bug.
 - Minor: Not directly related to the patch, but can fix it here. In QueueManger.dumpConfiguration(), we don't need aclsSubmitJobValue to be a StringBuilder. We can drop off getAclsInfo() method itself., Attaching patch incorporating review comments.

"Validation of job acls that are logged to history file" is added now to TestJobHistory. This somehow missed from trunk's patch of MAPREDUCE-1493, which was there in Y! dist patch., Looks good, +1 for the patch., Unit tests passed on my local machine.
