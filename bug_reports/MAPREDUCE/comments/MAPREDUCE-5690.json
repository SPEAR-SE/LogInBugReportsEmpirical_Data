[The failure of TestLocalMRNotification.testMR is caused by UtilsForTests.runJobKill(). During UtilsForTests.runJobKill(), a job with KillMapper is submitted to LocalJobRunner. When the job is in RUNNING status, kill it by job.killJob(). Then wait the job to complete with 20 seconds timeout.
The problem is job.killJob() intends to interrupt the KillMapper, which will sleep for a long time. While if  job.killJob() is invoked before KillMapper is launched, the job will continue run the mapper with a long time.
, This patch adds waiting job's map progress before job.killJob()., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
