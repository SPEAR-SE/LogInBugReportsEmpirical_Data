[[~aw] I cannot find a file named mapred-site.xml in the tarball. Do you mind sharing the relative path?, etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml, Oh wait a sec. I see what is going on.  mapred-site.xml doesn't actually exist but others do.  My auto-populate stuff is creating it.  So the real bug here is that mapred-site.xml doesn't exist., There is a etc/hadoop/mapred-site.xml.template file that users can start from. Do you think that is sufficient enough?, [~aw]  Thanks for filing this JIRA
[~haibochen] Thanks for looking into it.
Agree to rename mapred-site.xml.template to mapred-site.xml. Currently I don't see hdfs-site.xml.template, core-site.xml.template or yarn-site.xml.template, MR project should be consistent with those projects. [~haibochen] Not sure whether you're working on this JIRA, if not, I will attach a patch for this JIRA., Assigning this to [~yuanbo], and remove it as a blocker. Feel free to bump it back if you disagree, [~aw]., | (/) *{color:green}+1 overall{color}* |
