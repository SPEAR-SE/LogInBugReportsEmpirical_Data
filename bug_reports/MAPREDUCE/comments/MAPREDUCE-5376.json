This message is automatically generated., I recently made the opposite change in MAPREDUCE-4962, which I observed the fix the same issue.

I just took a look at the code and Counters#getCounter does seem to be looking at the display name, so now I'm confused as to what was going on originally., Don't forget to update the jobdetailshistory.jsp file too.  It has the same problem.

Regarding MAPREDUCE-4962, I am not sure what is happening but in my install of 1.2.1 this is not fixed., I attach the fixed patch(MAPREDUCE-5376-branch-1.2.patch) and the screenshot of jobdetails.jsp (jobsummary-after-20130903.png).
In jobdetailshistory.jsp of 1.2.1, the counter information of Map column and Reduce column is displayed correct (jobdetailshistory-20130903.png).
