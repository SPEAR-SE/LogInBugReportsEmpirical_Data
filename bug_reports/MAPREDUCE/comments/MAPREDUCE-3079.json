[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-2751 added a log message when the the DCE fails to delete a file (using the FileContext API). This could happen with the container dir or the app dir. We could either retry or try figuring out why the filecontext api is failing to delete the file., I'm not actively working on this, so if someone else needs it done, feel free to take it., Is this still an issue?  I was unable to reproduce it on 0.23.3 or trunk.]
