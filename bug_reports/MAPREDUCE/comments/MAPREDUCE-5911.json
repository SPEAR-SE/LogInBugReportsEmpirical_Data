This message is automatically generated., Thanks Ivan! 

Looks like Jenkins is not happy about the missing tests. I'm updating the repository and will write a new PATCH with tests., Hmm, the TestTeraSort is using JUnit 3 and is marked with the @Ignore annotation. 

Should we add another class for this test, remove the @Ignore annotation and fix the tests, or justify not having a test case for this case? 

Thanks
Bruno, Hi Bruno, it should be ok not to include a test case with this change, it's a minor fix to the examples.

Will commit the patch shortly. , Thanks for the quick reply Ivan! I'll continue reading the code and looking for easy issues to send patches or comment then., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6289 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6289/])

Thank you Bruno for the contribution!, [~ivanmi], This fix does not work if the default TotalOrderPartitioner is used instead of of SimplePartitioner. It will always fail because the partion file will have been written into the output dir by the the time checkOutputSpec is called. You should have taken my fix from MAPREDUCE-4879., Thank you [~jira.shegalov] for bringing this up. You are right, this won't work with the default partitioner. Sorry I wasn't aware of MAPREDUCE-4879. Let me take another look and see whether to revert the change that went in or go with your patch as an addendum. , OK, I am going to revert the change given that it does not work and resolve this Jira as a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-4879. Let's iterate further on the other Jira. Thanks again Gera for catching this., FAILURE: Integrated in Hadoop-trunk-Commit #6290 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/6290/])

I hadn't seen 4879 either, and thanks for reverting it Ivan :), SUCCESS: Integrated in Hadoop-Yarn-trunk #718 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Yarn-trunk/718/])
