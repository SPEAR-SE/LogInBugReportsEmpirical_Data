[Forgot to mention, the bug is that a Hadoop Path of form "file:/home/eli/hadoop-dirs1/mr2/taskTracker/eli/jobcache/job_201105162124_0001/jars/job.jar" becomes a Java File of form "/home/eli/src/mapreduce1/file:/home/eli/hadoop-dirs1/mr2/taskTracker/eli/jobcache/job_201105162124_0001/jars/job.jar".
, I would like to take this one on. Is file the only scheme needed? Or should this support other ones like, say, ftp?, Only file scheme is what's supported for now., I'm new to this, can I take this on please?
