[I've uploaded a patch, but it is dependent on the code I proposed for HDFS-6591., I mean HADOOP-6591, Rodrigo, please give me some time to first fix MAPREDUCE-1579, which will be committed back to 0.20., No problem! I just wanted to give a heads up on what I was planning. I'll upload a new patch once MAPREDUCE-1579 gets committed., Attached a new patch, but it cannot be tested while pending patch HADOOP-6591 is not committed., Question: Should we throw an exception if har.space.replace.enable=true?

Patch looks good, otherwise., I am not sure if it does make sense. looks like both the space replacement and the url encoding are going into the same version (0.22). So its hard to see if folks will be using har.space.replace== true, since the archives created with this release will have url encoding in place... no? , I am not sure if it does make sense. looks like both the space replacement and the url encoding are going into the same version (0.22). So its hard to see if folks will be using har.space.replace== true, since the archives created with this release will have url encoding in place... no? , I agree with Mohadev. However, people running Yahoo 0.20 might apply Nicholas' patch for now and eventually migrate to 0.22. In that case, throwing an exception is not a bad idea., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I'm checking the failed unit tests., TestHadoopArchives contains some useful test cases.  How about change it to work with the new version but not removing it?, You definitely have a point there after the last problems with HADOOP-6591. I'll change the patch., rodrigo,
  would you be uploading an updated patch?, I'm sorry I've been busy with other things and didn't have the time to update the unit tests. I'll definitely do it this weekend., This new patch doesn't adds new test cases to cover the problems found in HADOOP-6645 and HADOOP-6591.

It also keeps TestHadoopArchives.java, and only changes it so that there are no more tests with space replacement for invalid characters, since space replacement is removed by this patch., Trying Hudson again!, +1 the patch looks good... , -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., I looked at the test output and it seems to be unrelated to this patch (java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: org/apache/hadoop/metrics/jvm/JvmMetrics).

Mahadev, what do you think? Can we commit it?
