[Attaching a patch that fixes TestJobExecutionAsDifferentUser. I had missed fixing this testcase in MAPREDUCE-1385. I didn't know that I needed to run this using linux-task-controller. We *should* have an easier way to run all tests that use the linux-task-controller rather than having to guess that.. 
TestDebugScriptWithLinuxTaskController works in my box. What exception do you see?, There is no exception in the test TestDebugScriptWithLinuxTaskController. It fails with following assertion failure when i run with -Dtaskcontroller-ugi=nobody,nobody.

{noformat}, Looks like the validation itself is wrong in TestDebugScript:
{code}
-      String ttGroup = UnixUserGroupInformation.login().getGroupNames()[0];
+      Groups groups = new Groups(new Configuration());
+      String ttGroup = groups.getGroups(expectedUser).get(0);
{code}

The above code should look at group of the getCurrentUser(), not expectedUser., Updated Devaraj's patch for TestDebugScript to look at currentUser's group in the verification.

Both the tests passed on my machine., Submitting for hudson, bq. We should have an easier way to run all tests that use the linux-task-controller rather than having to guess that.
While these tests were originally checked in, we argued fiercely for and against having a separate ant target to run just these tests and eventually didn't add one.

This message is automatically generated., bq. -1 core tests.
Is due to MAPREDUCE-1412, Looked at the patch. It has missed some cases:
 - TestKillSubProcessesWithLinuxTaskController will also fail, but only if the group-owner of the binary is TT's non-primary group (which is typically the clusters' setup).
 - TestJobExecutionAsDifferentUser.testTimeoutStackTrace() has to run the job as proxy user.

To help future tests, should we describe in the javadoc of ClusterWithLinuxTaskController as to how one should run jobs as other users in the tests?

Can we also change the remaining "/testing/" paths in TestPipes to "testing/" so that we are consistent throughout the test-case?, Patch incorporates review comments.
bq. TestKillSubProcessesWithLinuxTaskController will also fail, but only if the group-owner of the binary is TT's non-primary group (which is typically the clusters' setup).
For running the tests with group-owner of the binary as secondary group of the test-runner needs a changes in ClusterWithLinuxTaskController after MAPREDUCE-899.  Patches does these changes.

Ran all LinuxTaskController tests with group-owner of the binary as secondary group of the test-runner. All tests passed except TestStreamingAsDifferentUser. 
TestStreamingAsDiffirentUser fails saying "Failed to specify server's Kerberos principal name". This failure is because the configuration "hadoop.security.authentication" is not picked up as "simple" from src/test/mapred-site.xml. This should be fixed by HADOOP-6538. If not, i will raise a jira and fix this.

, bq. All tests passed except TestStreamingAsDifferentUser. 
I verified the test TestStreamingAsDifferentUser passes by explicitly setting hadoop.security.authentication to simple., The patch looks good now, and the tests are all running fine now. +1.
