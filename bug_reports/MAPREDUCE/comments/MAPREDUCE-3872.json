[This patch fixes three issues:

1) ContainerLauncherImpl had a race in updating "allNodes". This might result in the pool size being incorrectly calculated.

2) test had an issues where waitForEvent could run forever

3) there's a race btw eventHandlingThread in ContainerLauncherImpl and the test code. In some cases the event would be processed, and the pool size increased, before all events had been processed (and allNodes updated with all new hosts). I believe this is the result of the test failure I documented in the description., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Refreshing the patch. Looks like MAPREDUCE-3634 fixed a number of the issues I had originally seen/fixed in this patch.

The latest version of this patch fixes the obvious concurrency bug in updating allNodes. This patch is currently tested by the unit tests, I don't see a way to trigger the bad case given it's non-deterministic. However by inspection you can see the obvious concurrency bug that exists in the current code., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., As handle() is not executed atomically, the eventQueue might be updated and the event dequeued in run() before allNodes is updated. This patch fixes that issue.

+1, +1 for the patch.

I'm attaching a slightly rebased version of the same code just so the patch applies cleanly to current trunk.  The race condition around {{allHosts}} happens pretty easily on Windows and causes frequent failures in {{TestContainerLauncher}}.  I confirmed that this patch fixes the failures on Windows and also works on Mac., Minor correction to my prior comments: it's a race condition around {{allNodes}}., [~cnauroth], the new patch appears to be identical to the previous patch; are you sure you uploaded the right file?  , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.

This message is automatically generated., [~rkanter], sorry for the confusion.  My new patch is in fact no different from the prior one.  My local copy of MAPREDUCE-3872.patch was the one dated 2/23/2012, from before you rebased and uploaded a new one on 1/4/2013.  I thought we needed to rebase again, but this was just a mistake on my part., +1. Committing this.
