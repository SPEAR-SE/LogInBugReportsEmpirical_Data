[MAPREDUCE-2989 caused this.

Sid, can you please take a look? Thanks., Everything is blocked for me because of this. Quick crack at this while I test., I still can't reproduce this, but looks like a race introduced by 2989 - will happen if INIT_APPLICATION + APPLICATION_INITED processed before any INIT_CONTAINER. Sorry about that., Jobs are running fine now. Ran a couple of them.

Not adding tests, a race condition essentially., Reproduced by adding a sleep. Fixed with the patch. Looks good. Thanks., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
