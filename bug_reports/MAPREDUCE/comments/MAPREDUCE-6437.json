[There are a couple of problems here.  First is that HDFS is the layer that should have retried.  If clients need to wrap HDFS calls in retries then that seems backwards.  The second problem is that the output committer is pluggable, and there's no indication whether commits are safe to retry.  That's being tracked by MAPREDUCE-5485.

Therefore this seems to be either a bug against HDFS if it didn't retry sufficiently in the HDFS layer or a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-5485., Closing this as a duplicate of MAPREDUCE-5485]
