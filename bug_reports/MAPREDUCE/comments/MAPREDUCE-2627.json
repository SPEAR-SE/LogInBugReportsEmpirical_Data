[Are you sure it's for 0.21? I think use guava in trunk. Can you tell us exactly how to reproduce the error?, s/I think use/I don't think we use/. Stuck keyboard..., It's actually 0.22. JobTracker won't start otherwise. Plamen, could you please post the exception here., (On trunk MR, I'd added guava in my patch at MAPREDUCE-1347 -- Not sure of 0.22 having it or not), Ah, I see the problem is in the branch-0.22. The problem is introduced by merging HDFS-941 from trunk, which pulls in guava dependency in hdfs and forgot to update ivy/hadoop-hdfs-template.xml, since trunk has proper dependency in hadoop-common-template.xml, which would suffice for trunk mapreduce., Thanks for the help here Luke.

Is it safe to say this issue is resolved then?, Ignore that last statement; this issue is still definitely unresolved.
Here is the build error I receive when trying to launch jobtracker out of mapreduce via cygwin.
Bringing guava-r09.jar directly into the folder above solves this issue. I have tried updating the hadoop-hdfs-template.xml file you mentioned Luke, to include: 

   "<dependency>
      <groupId>com.google.guava</groupId>
      <artifactId>guava</artifactId>
      <version>r09</version>
    </dependency>"

but this did not solve the issue either. Am I missing something in understanding your post?

Here is the exception that fails the launch:

************************************************************/, You need do a ant mvn-install for hdfs and then ant veryclean mvn-install -Dresolvers=internal for mapreduce.

Note the "veryclean" and the resolvers., That should take care of my issue, correct? (It appears to be the case so far atleast).

Is there anything left to update or create a patch for before calling this resolved? , bq. Is there anything left to update or create a patch for before calling this resolved?

Someone needs to create a patch for branch-0.22 (for hadoop-hdfs-template.xml) and have an hdfs committer review and commit it.

Let's create a new HDFS issue with the same name and link it to this one. I'll commit it there.
