[What actually happened was that these jobs failed during submission itself. As a result, _job.fail()_ was invoked to cleanup the job files on the local-fs, which inturn invokes JobTracker.finalizeJob(). JobTracker.finalizeJob() goes ahead and adds them to _userToJobsMap_. Note that the JIP is not present in the _jobs_ structure of the JobTracker but somehow found its way in _userToJobsMap_. Later the _RetireJobs_ thread runs and tries to claim these jobs. But the condition, _minConditionToRetire()_, waits until the history file gets copied, which in this case never happens as the history file was never created.  As a result of this, the jobs will be held up in the memory forever. Note that these jobs are not initialized and hence wont affect JobTracker's memory.  , Thanks for the quick update Amar., This doesnt occur in 0.20, 0.21 and trunk. ]
