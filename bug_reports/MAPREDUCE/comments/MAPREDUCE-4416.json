[There are actually two different TestJobConf. One in o.a.h.conf and another one in o.a.h.mapred. It's confusing, but not really a problem.

I had 37 failures/errors in jobclient when Clover is enabled.

For the failing test cases, the container's stderr files contain the following:

{noformat}
[CLOVER] FATAL ERROR: Clover could not be initialised. Are you sure you have
Clover in the runtime classpath? (class
java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError:com_cenqua_clover/CloverVersionInfo)
{noformat}

, The failing tests are using MiniMRCluster and submit jobs. Jobs fail because containers' classpath does not contain the clover jar. If I make the leaf project to pick up non-clovered mr-client-app, at least AM works. But custom mapper, reducers, etc. defined in mr-client-jobclient will be instrumented and be part of the code running inside containers, so the containers should be able to locate the clover jar.

We have a record of these tests working with clover at least on June 24. So I went back and tried the old revision but it didn't work this time...  I wonder how it ever worked. 

Before MAPREDUCE-4082, it seems the classpath in mr-client-app contained the clover jar. The jira comments also shows clover being in the generated classpath. The now problematic clovered tests might have worked okay back then.  Some tests were also being ignored.

There is MAPREDUCE-4141 that removed the hard dependency on clover. If these tests accidentally worked before, this might have stopped it. 

Maybe running clovered test code in yarn containers does not make sense. They are separate processes launched by something other than the test framework. The clover instrumentation doesn't seem to be designed to naturally cover them. We could exclude some of test helper classes from instrumentation., AM as well as mapper/reudcer fails, if run tests (e.g. {{TestChild}}) normally with {{-Pclover}}.

{noformat}, I don't believe 4141 is the issue, as that was a build change, not something that should effect containers.

I might be way off here but have you looked at "yarn.application.classpath" ? I ran into a similar sounding issue the other day with MAPREDUCE-4250. Ensure that clover jars are on the application classpath.
, Patrick, thanks for the comment. That might work, but the fact that it's not really an app-level dependency bothers me.  So I ended up adding the dependency inside the clover profile in hadoop-project/pom.xml. This causes each module to have clover jar as a dependency when -Pclover is specified. All mrapp-generated-classpath files will include the path to the clover jar. The package build will copy and include the clover jar, but we can't really use instrumented packages anyway.

As an alternative to globally adding the dependency, we can do it per module whenever necessary. At least the following two needs the dependency specified.
- hadoop-yarn-applications
- hadoop-mapreduce-client-jobclient
