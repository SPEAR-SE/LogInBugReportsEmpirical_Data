[Attaching patch that makes sure that all the daemons event handler exit when they run into exceptions. Also, as part of this, I made sure that for tests, the behavior reverts back to throwing exceptions.

Along the way I found that without this patch, few tests are crashing without reporting a junit failure due to sys-exit and so are hiding code bugs., Fixing a findBugs warning., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Can we set Dispatcher.DISPATCHER_EXIT_ON_ERROR_KEY default to false instead ? No of daemons are much less and would almost remain constant as opposed to tests ? Anybody adding a test or using a API should not get surprised by not setting this property., Other than Sharad's change request, 1 change required to AsyncDispatcher.

This message is automatically generated., we really ought to have a unified place where System.exit() calls; as when one runs any bit of Hadoop in a containers (as HADOOP-7977 intends to do for OSGi), the container will block those exits with a security manager and convert the calls into security exceptions. A single exit method would enable such exceptions to be logged, and conceivably handled slightly more gracefully (e.g. tell the daemon to die)., Agree with you Steve, but I'd like that done separately. As of now, because of this bug, several tests are not even running (or failing silently), so I am going to let this in and do that separately., I just committed this to trunk and branch-0.23.

Thanks for the reviews Sharad and Sid!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1832 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1832/])
