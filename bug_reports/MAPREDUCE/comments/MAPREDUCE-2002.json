[Does this duplicate MAPREDUCE-1569?, Yes, it does look like a dupe.  (I did do a search through Jira before filing this bug, but that bug didn't turn up in my search for some reason.), This should be closed as a dupe, MRUNIT already does this from MAPREDUCE-1569 as Aaron said. MRUNIT-86 also just added the withConfiguration to the 4 mapred classes: MapDriver, ReduceDriver, MapReduceDriver, PipelineMapReduceDriver as well as fixing the conf to get pushed down to the individual mapper/reducer in MapReduceDriver or the MapReduceDriver's in PipelineMapReduceDriver]
