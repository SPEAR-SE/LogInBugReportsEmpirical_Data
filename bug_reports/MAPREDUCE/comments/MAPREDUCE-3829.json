[Attaching patch that fixes the issue.
With the patch, Gridmix (a) emits out an error message instead of throwing an Exception message on to the console and (b) exits instead of failing some where else later on.
The patch also emits out an error message in other cases like setupEmulation fails and returns proper exit code instead of returning 0 in failure cases. , -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Ravi,
Should we reuse the 'STARTUP_FAILED_ERROR' in DistributedCacheEmulator? LOG statements should point to the real cause of the error. Lets try to keep all the error codes in one place i.e Gridmix.java. Other changes looks good to me., Attaching updated patch. Gridmix unit tests passed on my local machine., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Thanks Ravi for the patch. Few comments:
# It would be nice to move the FileSystem, size and path checks to the writeInputData() API. This way you can test this API and the current fix via JUnit tests.
# Add JUnit tests to test 
   ## writeInputData() w.r.t zero-data size, missing input dir
