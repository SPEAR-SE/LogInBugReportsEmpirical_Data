[What scheduler are you using? If you are using the default FifoScheduler, you'll run into MAPREDUCE-4299 which isn't committed to hadoop-0.23.1., That is exactly the issue, this bug can be marked duplicate, MAPREDUCE-4299, Starvation still occurring in 2.0.1, This graph shows the behaviour I am experiencing, Dup of MAPREDUCE-4299. Thanks Vasco., Vasco - the fix will show up via 2.1.0, which is very soon. Thanks., I tried in 2.1.0 (misread 4299 to be resolved in 2.0.1). I can confirm starvation issue is fixed there. 

With regard to the task scheduling in 2.1.0. If the amount of reducer input is more or less uniform, then what's the use of scheduling some reduce jobs very early in the job? It don't think it decreases total job completion time, since the last reduce job can only be scheduled after all mappers have been scheduled. If there are containers in abundance, then I understand the use of scheduling reducers as early as possible. But, if containers are scares it sound more reasonable to me to give all available resources to the mappers.]
