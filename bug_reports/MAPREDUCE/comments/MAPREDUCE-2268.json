[jvm reuse has very limited use in practice, especially on a multi-tenant cluster. Also, with security enabled, jvm reuse tends to get used even more rarely. In the 0.22 release notes, we should make a note of this, and should make this jira not-a-blocker. Thoughts ?, Agree with Milind.
Todd, let me know if you plan to fix it soon.
Unblocking for now., nope, no plans to work on this given the impl is different in 0.23]
