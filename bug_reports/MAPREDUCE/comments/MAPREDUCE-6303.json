The problem is that the code caught an IOException trying to shuffle and within the catch block the code throws _again_ which leaks up to the top of the Fetcher thread and kills the task., Patch that treats errors from setupConnectionsWithRetry when trying to re-establish the connection the same way we do errors when trying to establish the initial connection.  Added a unit test that fails without the fix and passes afterwards.

[~djp], I would appreciate it if you could take a look.  Thanks!
