[DeletionService has the following code which implies we don't want to wait too long for the shutdown to complete:

{code}
  public void stop() {
    sched.shutdown();
    try {
      sched.awaitTermination(10, SECONDS);
    } catch (InterruptedException e) {
      sched.shutdownNow();
    }
    super.stop();
  }
{code}

However the code never checks the result from {{awaitTermination()}}, and we can end up trying to continue the shutdown process with the thread pool still active., Patch to call setExecuteExistingDelayedTasksAfterShutdownPolicy() on init and fallback to shutdownNow() if ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.awaitTermination() fails., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., Note that with this patch the DeletionService can leave some scheduled files undeleted to avoid long hangs at shutdown.  A couple of alternatives:

* Implement a customized ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor that executes all scheduled tasks immediately upon shutdown rather than waiting the specified delays for each scheduled task.  This could still lead to long shutdown times if there are directories scheduled to be deleted with tons of files.
* Declare the existing behavior "as-intended" and note that NMs can take up to {{yarn.nodemanager.delete.debug-delay-sec}} seconds to finish shutting down.  Would be helpful to log a useful message when waiting., I like the approach that this is taking.  we have to be able to handle starting up from an unclean shutdown, so files need to be deleted on startup as well.  +1 for the patch.  , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1820 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1820/])

, bq. we have to be able to handle starting up from an unclean shutdown, so files need to be deleted on startup as well. +1 
Yes, that is what happens in 1.0.* too. You know of an open ticket for this?, I do not know of an open ticket for this.  I assumed that most components should be doing this anyways, because if the process crashes badly there is no guarantee that the files would be deleted, so I assumed that it should have been part of their initial design.  If that is not the case then yes we should file a JIRA for it., Thanks, created MAPREDUCE-3888.]
