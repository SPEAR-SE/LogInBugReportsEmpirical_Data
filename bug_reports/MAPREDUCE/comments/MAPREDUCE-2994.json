Mae Culpa. I introduced this problem in MAPREDUCE-2874. Sorry about that! I was attempting to consolidate code., +1, looks good.

I dropped the test, it was kinda lame, so was the bug itself.

I just committed this to trunk and branch 0.23. Thanks Devaraj K., Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #975 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/975/])
