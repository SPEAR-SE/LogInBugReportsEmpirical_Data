[Patch which changes the split from being on spaces to any amount of whitespace. Add a few tests for this as well., Hm, this seems to take care of extra intrnal whitespace, but I think we need a trim() in there too for trailing/leading whitespace, Thanks for the comments, Todd.

Updated patch to address Todd's comments. Also refactored the tests a little bit and added tests to check for proper handling of leading or trailing whitespace., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
