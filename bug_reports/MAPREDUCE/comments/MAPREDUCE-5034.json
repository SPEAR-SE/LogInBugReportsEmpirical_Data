[Which version is this found in?  There was an issue in MAPREDUCE-2264 that looks very similar to this that was already discovered.  Because of it the original patch was reverted and replaced with an update., Hi Sandy,
  It could be a previous version of the patch that we picked up for testing.  I will confirm soon.

, Hi Sandy,
  You are right.  It is from a previous version of the patch.  Sorry, about the confusion.  I will reject this Jira.
