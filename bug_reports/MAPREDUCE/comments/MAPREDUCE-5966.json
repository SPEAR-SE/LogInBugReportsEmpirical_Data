This message is automatically generated., Looks like this patch doesn't apply anymore, may be due MR-5979. Can you please update it? 

Also, I have the following minor comments:
# Reword the following comment to say "Update demands and weights of jobs and pools"
{code}
"+      // Update demands of jobs and pools and update weights
{code}
# In the test case, I don't think Math.max is required anymore.
{code}
+
+        // Until MAPREDUCE-5966 gets fixed we cannot have zero weight set
+        return Math.max(curWeight * random, 0.001);
{code}
# We should be able to fit the following in two lines with throws in the line after the method name?
{code}
+  public void testJobSchedulableSortingWithCustomWeightAdjuster() throws
+      IOException,
+      InterruptedException {
{code}
# Can we make all these variables final and capital letters. Also, don't see the need for numRacks and numNodesPerRack.
{code}
+    final int iterations = 100;
+    int jobCount = 100;
+    int numRacks = 100;
+    int numNodesPerRack = 2;
+    final int totalTaskTrackers = numNodesPerRack * numRacks;
{code}
# We should probably use pure camel-caps for this variable - {{randomTtid}}, Attaching patch that addresses feedback

Its used both for setupCluster and calculating TaskTrackers, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
