[I recall MAPREDUCE-2351 changing how this code path worked.  Don't entirely remember the details any more..., As per MAPREDUCE-2351, if we give any arbitrary file system URI for "mapred.job.tracker.history.completed.location" is working fine. But if we give other than local file system URI for "mapreduce.jobtracker.jobhistory.location" is failing. 

{code:title=JobHistory.java|borderStyle=solid}
  private void moveToDoneNow(Path fromPath, Path toPath) throws IOException {
    //check if path exists, in case of retries it may not exist
    if (logDirFs.exists(fromPath)) {
      LOG.info("Moving " + fromPath.toString() + " to " +
          toPath.toString());
      doneDirFs.moveFromLocalFile(fromPath, toPath);
      doneDirFs.setPermission(toPath,
          new FsPermission(JobHistory.HISTORY_FILE_PERMISSION));
    }
  }
{code} 

In the above code, doneDirFs.moveFromLocalFile(fromPath, toPath); is trying to move from local file system even if we give the history location as hdfs location and it is failing with the above exception.

This message is automatically generated., A few nits on the test cases:
- can you please make the constants in TestJobHistory capitalized names, eg LOG_DIR and BUILD_DIR instead of hLogDir and buildDir?
- the constant hLogDir is only used to constract the variable "logDir" twice - why not just make the constant like:
{code}
private static final String LOCAL_LOG_DIR_URI = "file:///" + new File(System.getProperty("hadoop.log.dir")).getAbsolutePath() + File.separator + "history";
{code}

If you could also add a brief javadoc for each of the test cases explaining what it's testing, that would be nice (for example "tests the case where the log directory is on local disk, the done folder is on HDFS, and the default FS is local"
, Thanks Todd for reviewing.

Provided patch by addressing the above comments.
