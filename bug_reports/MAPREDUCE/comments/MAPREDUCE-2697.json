This message is automatically generated., Forgot to add - the crux of the solution is that we limit the amount of 'overhead' for applications in the cluster to a percent defined by yarn.capacity-scheduler.maximum-am-resource-percent. Thus, the #concurrent apps scales well with cluster capacity and #apps don't have to 'configured' by admins., Updated patch to include new config in capacity-scheduler.xml, no code changes.

Also, default value of yarn.capacity-scheduler.maximum-am-resource-percent is 0.1, thus no more than 10% of the cluster is taken up by AMs and hence caps the #concurrent-apps.
