[This would be a very nice feature to have indeed.

Isn't it just a matter of using the maven-source plugin? 
I see it has been done that way in Spring Batch here: https://github.com/SpringSource/spring-batch/blob/master/spring-batch-parent/pom.xml

{code:xml}
<plugin>
<artifactId>maven-source-plugin</artifactId>
<executions>
<execution>
<id>attach-sources</id>
<goals>
<goal>jar</goal>
</goals>
</execution>
</executions>
</plugin>
{code}, Is there a reason no one's working on this? I don't know exactly what needs to be done from an infrastructure view to get this working, but it's a very important thing to have. Is it as easy as adding the maven-source-plugin as [~michaelisvy] says? Does anything need to change from a publishing perspective?]
