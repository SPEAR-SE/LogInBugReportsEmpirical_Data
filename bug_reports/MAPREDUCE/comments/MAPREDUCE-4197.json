This message is automatically generated., Given that it's only used by the MR client we only need to update hadoop-mapreduce-project/hadoop-mapreduce-client/pom.xml right?, Hi Eli! Its actually the mapreduce-examples which need the hsqldb Server class. However, hadoop-mapreduce-dist.xml (in hadoop-assemblies) seems to package only the dependencies in hadoop-mapreduce/pom.xml . (hadoop-mapreduce-examples/pom.xml already has hsqldb listed as a dependency, but its still not getting packaged in the tarball)

The test results from Hadoop QA are spurious. I ran both of them on my local machine and they passed. I suspect they failed because .m2 cache needs to be refreshed after MAPREDUCE-3942 went in. No tests were included because this is a change only in the pom.xml file., +1 looks good and pulls in the dependency. As Eli mentioned, seems like there should be a way to set it up by subproject but  since its not setup that way right now I think this is good.  Any maven experts out there know how to easily do that please let me know. , Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #2339 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/2339/])
