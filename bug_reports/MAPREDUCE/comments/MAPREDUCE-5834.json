This message is automatically generated., I was getting this failure til now. But today, I am not able to reproduce it even by running the test several times. Closing this issue for now., Seems like the timeout in the tests needs to be increased.
Random tests timesout during our nightly builds. I suppose this is due to machine load., Attaching the patch for increasing the timeout.
I have increased the timeout for all the tests in TestGridMixClasses to 3 times of the original timeout., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., Haven't seen this failure in the wild, but increasing the timeouts isn't risky.
