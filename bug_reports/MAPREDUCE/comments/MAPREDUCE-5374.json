[I've uploaded a patch against branch-1. Just to confirm, this bug affects the newer API org.apache.hadoop.mapreduce.lib.input.CombineFileRecordReader. 

A quick glance at the mapred version leads me to believe it wouldn't be affected, but I haven't checked to be certain. I will do this and amend the patch if necessary. , {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment 
  http://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12590884/MAPREDUCE-5374.patch
  against trunk revision .
