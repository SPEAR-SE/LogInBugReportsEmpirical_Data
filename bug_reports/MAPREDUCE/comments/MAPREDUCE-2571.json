This message is automatically generated., +1, I should note: the new findbugs warning seems like it must have come from a different patch - nothing related to CombineFileInputFormat shows up in the findbugs results. Same with the failing tests., Committed to 22 and trunk, thanks Bochun!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #718 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/718/])
