[Looking at the code they want to have 0.05% precision for the queue capacity.  Could you post the actual queue config? that you are using so we can replicate this?, <configuration>
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues</name>
  <value>a,b</value>
  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).
  </description>
</property>

 <property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.capacity</name>
  <value>100</value>
  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).
  </description>
</property>

<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.a.capacity</name>
  <value>40.0</value>
  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).
  </description>
</property>
</configuration>, Sorry that was the half part of config. Below is the full queue config

<configuration>
<property>
  <name>yarn.scheduler.capacity.root.queues</name>
  <value>a,b</value>
  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).

  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).
  </description>
</property>

<property>

  <value>60.5</value>
  <description>The queues at the this level (root is the root queue).

</configuration>, I think precision is incorrect. Making it right.

This message is automatically generated., These find bug warnings are not due to this patch.

Those will be fixed as part of MAPREDUCE-4452

Thanks,
Mayank, The change looks simple enough, and it is obvious now why it is off.  Good catch +1. I'll check this in., Thanks Mayank,
