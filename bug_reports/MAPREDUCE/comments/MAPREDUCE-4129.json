[Attaching a patch addressing this issue. The patch modifies the behavior to only write the log message the first time the oldGroupName is found, instead of every time getGroup(..) is called.
I don't think we need a test case for this change as it is a straightforward change in message logging., -1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The above failures reported by jenkins don't seem to be related to this patch., In your patch, the warning is printed every time a new group is created, even if the old and new names are the same. Don't you need to check that they are different? , Thanks Tom for reviewing this! You are right. Also checking they are different doesn't seem to be sufficient, because the name could have been cut because of the length limits. I have updated the patch to check if the name was found in the legacyMap before printing the log message. Please let me know if you have further comments., -1 overall.
