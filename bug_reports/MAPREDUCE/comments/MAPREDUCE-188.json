[I've noticed that occasionally snippets of web pages make it to the log pages.  This could potentially be a security problem, so we should fix this.  I don't think <pre> is a great solution, since there could be a </pre> in the text.

It's probably better to escape &<>, or set the content-type to text/plain.


, We no longer use JSP in MR2 that'd cause such issues.]
