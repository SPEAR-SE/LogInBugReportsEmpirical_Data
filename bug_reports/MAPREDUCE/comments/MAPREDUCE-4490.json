[We ran into this same issue on 0.20.205 - I'll add it is an affected version., Hi,

According to the description, I am trying to provide a patch, as we encountered same issue in our Hadoop cluster. 

First, I added a function in task-controller.c:
int initialize_task(const char* user,
    const char * good_local_dirs, const char *job_id, const char *task_id) {
	// Prepare the attempt directories for the task JVM.
	int result = create_attempt_directories(user, good_local_dirs, job_id, task_id);
	return result;
}

Of cause, I also modified task-controller.h/task-controller.c/main.c. After that, I try to call this feature through ShellCommandExecutor in LinuxTaskController#createLogDir. However, I found the default LinuxTaskController#createLogDir only has two input parameters (TaskAttemptID taskID,boolean isCleanup), and does not satisfy the input parameters of function initialize_task(const char* user,const char * good_local_dirs, const char *job_id, const char *task_id): we can not get user, dir, jobid, taskid from LinuxTaskController#createLogDir.

Any suggestions on the issue which is blocking my progress?

Thanks a lot! 

, Attached patch works well in my local environment and could resolve current issue. Any feedback is welcome! , As above comments/description, the root cause of this issue is that userlogs directories are created by the task-controller binary which only runs once per JVM when using LinuxTaskController. So the major purpose of the patch is to add a new command to task-controller initialize task to create attempt directories and invoke it, with ShellCommandExecutor, in the LinuxTaskController#createLogDir method. Below are the main details of the modifications:
1. src/c++/task-controller/impl/task-controller.h: 
Add declaration to new method initialize_task()
2. src/c++/task-controller/impl/task-controller.c:
Implement the new method initialize_task() which invokes existing method create_attempt_directories()
3. src/c++/task-controller/impl/main.c:
To allow to invoke new method initialize_task() from ShellCommandExecutor
4. src/mapred/org/apache/hadoop/mapred/LinuxTaskController.java:
In method createLogDir() to invoke initialize_task() from ShellCommandExecutor to create attempt directory before launching each task, {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
