[Ignoring dependencies due to unit tests, the dependency occurs in the ShuffleHandler which runs inside the nodemanager as an auxiliary service.  The ShuffleHandler is looking for ContainerLocalizer.USERCACHE and ContainerLocalizer.APPCACHE to help locate where the files are on disk.  These constants could be moved to the yarn API package or we could add a mechanism for aux services to obtain the application-specific local storage directories at runtime from the nodemanager., We need an API that aux-services can use instead of us exposing constants.

Not sure why this would be an incompatible change..]
