This message is automatically generated., Thanks for posting a patch, Chen.  Patch approach looks good, and I just have some minor nits:

* We've already parsed, or at least tried to parse, the submit time earlier.  Rather than re-parsing the submit time index again we can just do indexInfo.getSubmitTime()
* Formatting: a space should be before the brace for the {{if}}
* The test case name should be more specific to the nature of the test, e.g.: testJobStartTimeBackwardsCompatible or something similar., Thank you for the comments, [~jlowe]. I updated patch following your suggestion., {color:green}+1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
