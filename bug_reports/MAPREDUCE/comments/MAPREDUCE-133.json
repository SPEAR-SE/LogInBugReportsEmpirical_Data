[This doesn't seem to be a problem in 0.20 or trunk anymore.

Running JobControl tests or running a chained job test with checks for isComplete() and launching the second job works just fine. Perhaps it was an issue with the way the output committing worked in '06 (year of ticket).

This ticket has gone stale. Closing as Cannot Reproduce.]
