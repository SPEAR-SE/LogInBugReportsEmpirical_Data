[This makes it difficult for me to view logs for tasks with a small amount of output (I have to log in to the machine in question).  This is masking another exception, since the exception comes from a catch block., This corresponds with an error in the web ui:

HTTP ERROR: 410

Failed to retrieve syslog log for task: task_200801020752_0383_m_000000_0
, This is because response.sendError is called after out.write in TaskLogServlet., This issue appears to have gone stale. I have not noticed this issue anymore on MR1 today. Resolving as 'Cannot Reproduce' for now.]
