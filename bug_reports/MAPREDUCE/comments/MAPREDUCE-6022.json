[I believe this was caused by HADOOP-10178.  If I revert that change then the property re-appears in the streaming job environment., Configuration is a touchy thing, so here's a prototype patch that tries to fix this in a streaming-specific way by explicitly asking the configuration object to expand the deprecated properties so it can expect them when iterating even if they weren't explicitly referenced in get/set.  This allows them to show up in the streaming environment., Adding tests., {color:red}-1 overall{color}.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., The findbug warnings are unrelated, and I believe the unit test failure is as well.  It passes for me locally., +1 looks good to me., I've just committed this.
