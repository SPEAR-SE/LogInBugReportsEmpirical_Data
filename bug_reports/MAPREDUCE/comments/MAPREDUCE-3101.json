, Umbrella ticket being fixed across versions., Originally filed this before YARN was its own sub-project.

Resolving this very old umbrella JIRA, YARN-47 was already resolved too.. Security (auth + authz) has largely been nearly complete/stable in YARN and MR since this ticket was opened. And as new requirements come in, we can open new tickets.
 - Will leave the open sub-tasks as they are.
 - Unassigning from me given multiple contributors on the tasks.
 - No fix-version as this was done across releases.]
