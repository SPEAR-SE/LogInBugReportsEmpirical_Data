This message is automatically generated., The documentation has been update to reflect the current behavior. I have also verified that mvn site:site still produces valid html documentation and that my new changes are present and correct., Jonathan, the patch looks good; and the docs!

Minor nit:
{code}
+    String defaultAcl = queue.contains(DOT) ? NONE_ACL : ALL_ACL;
{code}

could be more direct, like:

{code}
+    public static final String ROOT = "root"; // Move to CapacitySchedulerConfiguration from CapacityScheduler
+    String defaultAcl = queue.equals(ROOT) ? NONE_ACL : ALL_ACL;
{code}, Updated patch addressing the minor nit. It's bigger since I moved 'ROOT' from CapacityScheduler to CapacitySchedulerConfiguration, +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
