This message is automatically generated., Hi Gera Shegalov thanks for your help. 
I am not sure what functionality I should test for in TestMRJobs and TestYARNRunner.

I guess I am really having a tough time grasping all that createApplicationResource() is doing. The function is over 100 lines. It doesn't seem to be designed with modularity in mind, and it's rather difficult to determine what functionality I should be testing. This could be just my own inexperience. I appreciate any sort of feedback or guidance on writing these tests., \\
