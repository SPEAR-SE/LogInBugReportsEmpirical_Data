[VisualVM screenshot attached, FileSystem class keeps a static cache of all FileSystem objects. See FileSystem#CACHE static field. The cache key is a pair of file system URI (string) and Configuration object. To fix that I'd suggest to run FileSystem.closeAll() (which clears the cache) somewhere in the cleanup section of TaskRunner.java]
