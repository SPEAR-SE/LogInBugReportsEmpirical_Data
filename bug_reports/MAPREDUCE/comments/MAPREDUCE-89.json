[As of today we can filter the jobs based on their status. In any case this will be an improvement and not a bug., This is no longer a problem on both the Job History Server web app of MR2 and the MR1 JobTracker UI (There's a column indicating this). Resolving for now as its gone stale and already been fixed.]
