Seems like these are cropping every now and then. , @Hitesh,
 Is the findbugs exclude necessary with the latest patch?, Yes - the patch is more or less same as the first one which threw a findbugs warning. The warning can be ignored as the variable is initialized only once and never changed by the scheduler. , I just committed this. Thanks Hitesh!, Integrated in Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit #1736 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Hdfs-trunk-Commit/1736/])
