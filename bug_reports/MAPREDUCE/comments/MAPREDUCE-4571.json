[The issue here is that is seems the PartialJob and the MockCompletedJob do not return the same things.  The Partial jobs assumes totalMaps = completedmaps, presumably since its in the job history server.  The MockCompletedJob has totalMaps=1 and completedMaps=0.  The test that is failing was passing the partial job in to compare to webservices output of full job.  So need to fix the test to pass in the full job to verify against.

It looks like it worked with jdk6 because it just so happened that the mock job created has both total and completed as 1. If you run that one Testcase by itself with jdk6, then it fails since it hasn't cycled through creating other jobs first., Fix MockCompletedJobs to match the history server PartialJob and have completed=total.  Also fix the test to pass in the full jobs to compare to the webservices full jobs., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
