[It will be difficult to pass it directly back to client because initialization happens asynchronously. May be we can do this using diagnostic messages and let JobClient scan these, similar to task-failures.

This in many ways is similar to job failures due to many other reasons - for e.g, I often find myself scanning through each failed task to see how many times it failed and whether this task's is the reason for the job's failure.

A common solution can be a single job-level diagnostic message that can quote a simple single line reason for failure. This can be used by JobClient on job-failure and by UI too., MAPREDUCE-343 might help solve some part of this.]
