[which release of hadoop has this behaviour been seen?, The issue was verison 0.20. Owen, Please correct me if I am wrong., It was trunk after 0.20, but based on my understanding of the likely cause, it would also affect 0.20.0
, Attaching patch for trunk.
Please review and provide your comments., Some comments:

# On header verification failures, we should return null instead of continuing
# The validation for from_map_id of the header against the expected map id can be added in addition to validating if the map id is in the correct format, Attaching patch with the suggested changes., +1. Patch looks fine., Attaching patch for branch 0.20, Attaching new patch that applies to trunk. No extra code changes compared to earlier patch., I just committed this. Thanks, Ravi!, Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk #25 (See [http://hudson.zones.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/25/])
    , This doesn't need a unit test as the code changes are tested by many other testcases.]
