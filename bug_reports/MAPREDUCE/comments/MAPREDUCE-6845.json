[[~jlowe] I tag you here and hope to get your thoughts. Thanks in advance., I think there's confusion on the paths.  The '/logs' path in HttpServer2 refers to the path http://<jhsaddr>/logs, while the container logs path is http://<jhsaddr>/jobhistory/logs.  The JHS webapp is registered under the "jobhistory" prefix (see HistoryClientService#initializeWebApp).  Therefore one path is not a prefix of the other.  Our clusters are secure, and our non-admin users are able to access their job logs., [~jlowe] Thanks for your response.
That's quite a relief for me :). Sorry my mistake, I use the wrong url to access container log. close it as "Not a problem"
