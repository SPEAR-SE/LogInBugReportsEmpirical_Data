[If there are lots of apps in the apps table it will try to fetch some of them using AJAX.  There is probably a mismatch between the JSON returned from the call, and what the data table needs.  Looks like we added in a column some where and forgot to update the JSON., I see this issue happening very often. The tables no longer can be sorted and also the next pages cannot be viewed after running a little over 100+ jobs. Raising the priority since the UI becomes completely unusable at this point. , The default row limit for switching to JSON vs HTML is 100 rows. You can specify the rowlimit URL param to override the default.

For Example
<machine>:<port>/cluster/apps?rowlimit=1, Manual testing was performed with ?rowlimit=1 before and after the patch was applied, +1 looks good to me. Ill go ahead and commit this., Cool. Thanks for taking a look, Mahadev., Just committed this. Thanks Jonathan!, Ran tests/test-patch on my box, hudson failed on running the test-patch on this patch.
