I feel even this fix doesn't honors the cleanupJob of CustomCommitter. Seems needs to be fixed in some 2.x as well., Ok you've discovered a second, valid issue. Can we repurpose this JIRA to fix that, or would you like to see this backported to 1.x-based releases too? In the latter case, please file a second JIRA to fix and add a cleanup call., I feel the current JIRA description targets the "second, valid issue":-).
I think no need to re-purpose the JIRA (may be we need to change the Affects Version).

Raised a new one MAPREDUCE-4281  , Moved to 1.2.0 upon release of 1.1.0., Changed Target Version to 1.3.0 upon release of 1.2.0. Please change to 1.2.1 if you intend to submit a fix for branch-1.2.]
