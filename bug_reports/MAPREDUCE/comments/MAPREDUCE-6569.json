[At First I think it's memory leak. so I set am conf 
mapred-site.xml 
<property>                                                                                                                                                              
        <name>yarn.app.mapreduce.am.command-opts</name>                                                                                                                     
        <value>-Xms1536m -Xmx2048m</value>                                                                                                                                   
</property>

But some jobs also has this problem , As per log the am is killed not because of the memory.
Please check in the log do you message like : "Expired:  container_id Timed out after 600 secs"
Any AM that doesnâ€™t heartbeat within a configured interval of time, by default 10 minutes, is deemed dead and is expired by the RM.
Can you get the thread dump of the AMContainer to check why it is stucked., [~mohdshahidkhan], We get the thread dump of AM.
And Find that RMContainerAllocator.handleEvent  and heartbeat BLOCKED
, [~templedf]   [~djp], Could you please take a look ? Thanks ]
