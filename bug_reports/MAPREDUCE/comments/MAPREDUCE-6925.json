[hi there, any update on this item ?, Is this issue has been solved now? [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/MAPREDUCE-5875|MAPREDUCE-5875] make me confused. From my test, this problem still exists. If we set "mapreduce.job.counters.max"  parameter on the client side, will it work or not?, AFAIK, this is still an issue. I agree that the JIRAs are a bit confusing because there were a few different ones. I believe they've all been reverted, and this JIRA (MAPREDUCE-6925) was left open to come up with a different fix. Unfortunately, nobody's been able to come up with an acceptable fix. I like the simplicity of my fix, [^MAPREDUCE-6288.002.patch], on MAPREDUCE-6288, but there were concerns about changing permissions.]
