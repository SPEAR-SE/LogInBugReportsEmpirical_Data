[Below is the output of MRReliability, when history is enabled:

mapred.ReliabilityTest: Waiting for the job org.apache.hadoop.examples.SleepJob to start
mapred.JobClient: Running job:<jobID>
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Will kill tasks based on Maps' progress
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Initial progress threshold: 0.2. Threshold Multiplier: 2. Number of iterations: 2
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Will kill tasks based on Reduces' progress
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Initial progress threshold: 0.2. Threshold Multiplier: 2. Number of iterations: 2
mapred.ReliabilityTest: DONE WITH THE TASK KILL/FAIL TESTS
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Will STOP/RESUME tasktrackers based on Maps' progress
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Initial progress threshold: 0.4. Threshold Multiplier: 2. Number of iterations: 1
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Will STOP/RESUME tasktrackers based on Reduces' progress
mapred.ReliabilityTest: Initial progress threshold: 0.4. Threshold Multiplier: 2. Number of iterations: 1
mapred.ReliabilityTest: DONE WITH THE TESTS TO DO WITH LOST TASKTRACKERS
mapred.JobClient:  map 0% reduce 0%
mapred.JobClient:  map 1% reduce 0%
mapred.JobClient:  map 2% reduce 0%

In the above output, statements such as "DONE WITH THE TASK KILL/FAIL TESTS" and "DONE WITH THE TESTS TO DO WITH LOST TASKTRACKERS" are logged even before the test starts. And also, all through the test there were no task failures or lost TTs observed. Hence the MRReliabilityTest is broken when history is enabled.
