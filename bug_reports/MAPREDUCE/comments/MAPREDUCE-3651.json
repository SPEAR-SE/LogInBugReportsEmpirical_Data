This message is automatically generated., Test TestQueueManagerRefresh was already testing this and failing, so no extra tests needed., looks like the mapred queue list command fails with this on parent queues, need to investigate further., So the problem with the mapred queue -list is actually in the JobClient in routine getJobQueueInfoArray.  It is currently only converting the root queues from QueueInfo to JobQueueInfo.  This routine needs to handle converting the child queues also., -1 overall.

This message is automatically generated., The patch looks good. Thomas, can you please investigate the javac warnings?, looking., The issue is I added another reference to JobQueueInfo which is deprecated.  Should I just add an exception for it?
Currently there are 3 references to it and then I added anther.

Here is the diff:

There isnt an exception file for deprecation. Ill go ahead and commit this as it is., I just committed this.
