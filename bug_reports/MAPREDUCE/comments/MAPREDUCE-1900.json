[Patch for Y20S. The patch basically closes the filesystems, created during the job execution, at the end of the job., //sigh. Had we implemented ref-counted fs cache (HADOOP-4665) and call close() every time a local context finishes using an fs instance, we are unlikely hit this problem., I mean to say HADOOP-4655 instead of HADOOP-4665., Missed one case. This patch fixes it., a port for trunk., Here is the test-patch result. Also ran ant test and test-contrib. TestSimulatorDeterministicReplay failed, but it also fails without the patch. Other tests are passing.

, +1 patch looks good.
"Please justify why no new tests are needed for this patch.
Also please list what manual steps were performed to verify this patch.", The patch was tested manually on Yahoo clusters. I just committed this. Thanks, Kan for the trunk patch., This patch breaks hadoop for me.  Can we reconsider it?

It is not safe to call

      FileSystem.closeAllForUGI(UserGroupInformation.getCurrentUser());

in order to close one filesystem connection.

See MAPREDUCE-2060

It causes the parent JobTracker's FileSystem object to be closed as well, making it impossible (for me) to successfully submit a job., Integrated in Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit #523 (See [https://hudson.apache.org/hudson/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk-Commit/523/])
