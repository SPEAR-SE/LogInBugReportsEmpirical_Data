[A quick look at the code suggests that the problem is with the following in JobTracker.java +3210 in lostTracker() method:
{code}
        TaskInProgress tip = taskidToTIPMap.get(taskId);
        JobInProgress job = tip.getJob();
{code}

If the job is completed/removed from the memory, this would result in an NPE. Not sure if there are any more such places., Not a problem anymore on any of the recent stable releases - and we've not seen this error appear again either. The methods that remove a tracker use proper locking today that seems to prevent this from occurring anymore.

Gone stale, closing as 'Not a Problem' (anymore).]
