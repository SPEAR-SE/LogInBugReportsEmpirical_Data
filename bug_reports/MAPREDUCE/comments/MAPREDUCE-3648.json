[looks like this was broken when mavenization of streaming happened (HADOOP-7590).  It moved the ClassWithNoPackage.java  from hadoop-mapreduce-project/src/test/mapred/testjar/ClassWithNoPackage.java to hadoop-tools/hadoop-streaming/src/test/java/ClassWithNoPackage.java and TestJobConf is expecting it in the testjar

, simple add the ClassWithNoPackage back., @Thomas,
 Is ClassWithNoPackage.java needed in hadoop-streaming? If not lets remove that and put it in test-jar. Better to have a single copy., yes its used in hadoop-tools/hadoop-streaming/src/test/javaorg/apache/hadoop/streaming/TestClassWithNoPackage.java  

Any suggestions?, Actually I could check to see if there is another class still in the testjob.jar that I could use.  Let me check on that., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment

This message is automatically generated., changed to use a different class already in the testjob.jar file so we won't have the duplicate ClassWithNoPackage class., +1 overall.  Here are the results of testing the latest attachment
