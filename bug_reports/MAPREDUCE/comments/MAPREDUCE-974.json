[There are currently 2 commands
	[-list-active-trackers]
	[-list-blacklisted-trackers]
And with the MAPRED-892 I want to add the third one
	[-list-trackers]

They all are cluster level commands rather than job level.
Do you think it would make sense to move all of them from job to mradmin?
, Not sure though. *mradmin* is for admins. _-list-active-trackers_ and _-list-blacklisted-trackers_ can be used by anyone which is also true for _-list-trackers_. I think we should introduce a switch called *mr* similar to *fs* for querying MapReduce. Thoughts?, Well, so we can create a new tool called MRShell that will handle all non job and non admin related stuff, like getting cluster/tracker information, etc.
We can move the existing commands there.

If this is the plan I am willing to work on a patch for it., Yes. Either MRShell or simply mr (similar to bin/hadoop fs)., How can we 'deprecate' the old usage without moving it away in case some tools rely on bin/hadoop job -list-active-trackers?, This change also requires updating both mapreduce and common project.
It is only the mapred script that has to be patched in common, but they still have to go in together., This patch consists of 2 parts. First one (MAPRED-974.patch) is the mapred modifications, the second one is modifications in launch scripts in common., Closing this as stale for Hadoop 2.x]
