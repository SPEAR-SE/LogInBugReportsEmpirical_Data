[Zheng has made some change internally to fix this problem. I am assigning this to him., We haven't done a 1.x/0.21/0.22 based release in a long long time. Unlikely this issue is going to be fixed/released.

This should happen in 2.x at all, but if if you see something, please file a new ticket.

Closing this as Won't Fix. Please revert back if you disagree. Thanks.
