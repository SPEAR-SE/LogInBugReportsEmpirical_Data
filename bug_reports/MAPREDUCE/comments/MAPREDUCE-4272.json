, Looks like the integration with trunk / 2.0 was not successful.  Keeping bug open for that.
Fix accepted into 1.1.2., Looks like build 1292 failed for many other changes unrelated to this as well. https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-Mapreduce-trunk/1305/ which includes this change seems to be fine.]
