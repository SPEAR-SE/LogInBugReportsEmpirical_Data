This message is automatically generated., +1 Changes looks good no need of additional test case as only the code quality is improbed, Thanks [~decster] for the patch and [~mohdshahidkhan] for review.

Changes looks good to me except there is a whitespace warning with the patch, can you have look into this?
{code:xml}
<stdin>:10: trailing whitespace.
          comparator, keyClass, valueClass,
warning: 1 line adds whitespace errors.
{code}, re submitting the patch after correcting the format, whitespace error appears with the latest patch as well., Updating the patch with white space fix., \\
