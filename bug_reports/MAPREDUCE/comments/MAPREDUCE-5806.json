This message is automatically generated., Updated patch to fix order of assignment so that we can set map and reduce specific environment variables and override HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS and HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER., This belongs to MapReduce, moving it., The core changes look good to me. One comment on the test-case: can we add a simple test which shows that user can override HADOOP_ROOT_LOGGER and HADOOP_CLIENT_OPTS by using the env config properties?, {color:green}+1 overall{color}.
