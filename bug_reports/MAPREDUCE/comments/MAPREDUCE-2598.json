[JH UI - jobname, status fixed on list page
Several NPEs fixed - related to failed jobs and counters.
Ensure History finished events are not generated unless start events have been generated (existing JHParser does not handle these)
Client redirected to JobHistoryClientService for FAILED and KILLED jobs as well (instead of SUCCEEDED only), +1. Committed to MR-279. Thanks Sidd!]
