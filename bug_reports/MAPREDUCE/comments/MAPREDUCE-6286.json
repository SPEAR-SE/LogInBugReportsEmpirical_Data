, Reopening this to set the right resolution state. Since the fix was reverted and never added back (does not exist on trunk), the Fixed resolution is incorrect., Uh sorry, the commit message timeline is confusing on this. This is indeed present in the trunk and branch-2.8/branch-2, was only reverted in branch-2.7. My bad - sorry for the noise - the addendum vs. 2.7 notes confused me :(

Resetting to earlier state., Revert it from branch-2.8 given we revert MAPREDUCE-5875 per discussion in MAPREDUCE-6288., SUCCESS: Integrated in Jenkins build Hadoop-trunk-Commit #12071 (See [https://builds.apache.org/job/Hadoop-trunk-Commit/12071/])
