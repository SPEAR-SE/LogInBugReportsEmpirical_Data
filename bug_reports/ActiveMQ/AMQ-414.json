        "description": "I raised a Geronimo issue last week -- http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/GERONIMO-1155. I also posted a patch. I'll repost, here...\n\nWhile running a test of the DayTrader sample application, the server received an OutOfMemoryException. At the time of failure, there were over 150,000 ActiveMQSession objects. These sessions were being kept alive by ActiveMQ TransactionContexts associated with ActiveMQManagedConnections. I believe that Sessions are being registered with the ActiveMQManagedConnection TransactionContexts, but will never be unregistered via TransactionContext.removeSession(Session).\n\nIn non-managed environments, the TransactionContext is owned by the Session. So, a Session does not need to be explicitly removed from the TransactionContext. Once a Session has been closed, both the Session and the TransactionContext are available for garbage collection. The Session never bothers to \"unregister\" with its associated TransactionContext. IMO, this is the root of the problem. There's a different TransactionContexts structure in RA environments.\n\nManagedConnections have an additional TransactionContext. As Sessions are created, an RATransactionContext is generated for each new Session. As a Session registers with the RATransactionContext, the RATransactionContext locally registers the Session, but also registers the Session with the ManagedConnection's TransactionContext. It's this registration that is the problem... The Session will never be removed from the ManagedConnection's TransactionContext.\n\nDayTrader repeatedly drives an EJB to publish a message. The processing in the EJB is pretty simple, create a connection from a ConnectionFactory, create a session, create a producer, and send a message. .createConnection(), connection.createSession(), session.createProducer, connection.close(). The ManagedConnection is pooled. So, the connection (and its TransactionContext) are long-lived. Each iteration through the EJB is going to cause the creation of a new Session which is registered with the ManagedConnection's TransactionContext. However, the Session will never be removed from this TransactionContext...\n\nI could create the same basic problem by creating a Connection, and repeatedly creating a session and closing it. \n\nThe above is from my reading of the code. I'm not currently able to run DayTrader in my dev environment. Should be easy to create a simple test-case, but I haven't gotten around to it, yet. \n\nThe obvious fix is to add the following to ActiveMQSession.doClose():\n\n    this.transactionContext.removeSession(this);\n\nI'll post a patch. Let me know if I'm missing something obvious... ",
