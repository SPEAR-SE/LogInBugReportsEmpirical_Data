        "description": "I have been testing version 266 and found that request/reply test is not working at a 100% level across networked brokers.  At first I thought that the race condition that had been a prior release had be revived. This was where replier would try to use the temp destination before the bridge was established.  Before that was fixed I could just insert a delay after creating the temp destination and its use to get around the problem.  Now it seems that work-around does not work either.  The first attempt to send a message to the temp destination will fail.\n\nI have found that repeated attempts will succeed.  It seems that the first failed attempt is trigger a completion of the temp definition setup?  Anyway if after the first request fails to receive the reply, another request is made, the replying process has no problem sending the second reply.\n\nCould this be another problem introduced as a result of the AdvisorySupport changes?
