However after a new deployment of our ActiveMQ and subsequent restart of it we started to encounter weird behavior that some producers would either get timeouts from their request-reply messages or a \"unknown destination exception\" once the reply is being sent on a temp-queue, the issue only happened when the producer and consumer were connected to different brokers in the network. After some testing we ultimately found out that after a restart often brokers would not start both network bridges, one for queues and one for topics, but rather only one of them. For example in a 3 broker setup each broker usually had 4 network bridges active, 2 for each other broker. However during some restarts we would see any number of active bridges between 2 and 4, no matter the wait time the 2nd bridge to another broker was never started. The logs also showed no output whatsoever, as long as 1 broker was shutdown the other two would output 'connection refused' once he started they would show either 1 or 2 'successfully reconnected' and start exactly this amount of bridges to him.\nAs soon as we switched back to ssl:// protocol on the transport connector the issue was gone for good, no matter how many restarts always 4 network bridges would be started in each broker. Switching back to nio:// the problem is back right away.\nFor now we are checking if it is worth configuring an additional TransportConnector running nio:// just for producers and consumers while the network uses the tcp:// connector. The documentations regarding NetworkConnectors usually all use tcp:// or multicast:// (which is not an option for us) in the TransportConnector the bridges attach to, so we are not entirely sure if nio:// is even supposed to work for this case or if this is indeed a bug somewhere.",
