        "description": "I was trying to set up a SimpleAuthenticationBroker programatically rather than through the xml.  I've tried with 4.0.1 and 4.1.  The symptom was that, although the broker is set as an intercepter and it detects a bad password and emits a SecurityException, the producer is still allowed to produce messages.  I can see the producer get the bad login indication through the following log message: \n\nWARN  org.apache.activemq.network.DemandForwardingBridge - Unexpected remote command: ConnectionError {commandId = 2, responseRequired = false, connectionId = null, exception = java.lang.SecurityException: User name or password is invalid.}\n\nBut then, the next thing I know, my consumers, that have successfully logged in, start receiving messages from this very same producer.\n\nAfter some investigation, I've been able to get the behavior I want, but I had to modify AbstractConnection.java to do it.  I dont know if my modifications are appropriate, so could someone take a look and let me know whether this is a desirable change or not?\n\nSpecifically, I added an additional catch block after line 202 of AbstractConnection and before the catch(Throwable).  The new code is: \n\ncatch ( SecurityException e1)\n   {\n   ConnectionError ce = new ConnectionError();\n   ce.setException(e1);\n   dispatchSync(ce);\n   try\n      {\n      this.stop();\n      }\n   catch (Exception e2)\n      {\n      serviceLog.error(\"Unable to stop the connection after the SecurityException:  \" + e2);\n      }\n\nNotice the dispatchSync versus dispatchAsync - I did this to ensure that the client was informed off the security violation before the connection is stopped.\n",
