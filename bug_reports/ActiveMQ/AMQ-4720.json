        "description": "Summary of problem:\n-------------------\nIf a static failover network connector is setup to connect to 2 other brokers & to fail-back to a priority broker; messages can be lost after fail-back because the remote broker deletes them due to duplicate producer-sequence numbers even though the producer-id has changed.\nMy suspicion is that the remote broker doesn't recognise that the re-established connection is a network connection & so doesn't check producer-id.\n\n\nTest-harness setup:\n-------------------\nUsing ActiveMQ 5.8.0 binary download.\nOnly changes are to logging settings & to the configuration file.\n\n3 brokers (\"amq1\", \"amq2\", \"amq3\"), all brokers running on localhost.\nEach uses their own config file (amq1.xml, amq2.xml, amq3.xml)\n\nBroker amq1 has a failover duplex connection to amq2.\nBroker amq3 has a duplex failover connection to both amq1 + amq2, it is configured to always try to connect to amq1 first (\"randomize=false\") and to fail-back to amq1 if it comes back online (\"priorityBackup=true\")\n\nConsumer connects to broker amq1\nProducer connects to broker amq3\n\nTest-harness sender application creates a new session each time it is run & sends a set of messages.\nThe sending session is not transacted & is set to auto-acknowledge.\nMessages are sent with persistent delivery mode.\nMessages are on queue \"MyQueue\"\n\n\nTest script:\n------------\nStart all 3 brokers.\nBroker amq3 establishes a connection to amq1.\nBroker amq1 establishes a connection to amq2.\n\nConsumer connects to amq2 & starts consuming queue \"MyQueue\".\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed on to broker amq1 which forwards them to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer.\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all delivered as before - N.B. producerID is different as this is a new connection.\n\nBroker amq1 is shut down.\nBroker amq3 fails-over to connect to amq2.\n\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed directly to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer - (as before, the producer-id has changed).\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are delivered as before.\n\nBroker amq1 is restarted \nBroker amq1 re-establishes its connection to amq2.\n\nBroker amq3 notices that amq1 is available & fails-back to it.\n    - Broker amq3 closes its connection to amq2\n    - Broker amq3 starts a new connection to amq1\n\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed directly to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer - (as before, the producer-id has changed).\n    - N.B.
