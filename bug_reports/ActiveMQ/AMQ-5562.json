        "description": "If I send to a producer with:\n\n        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer( dest );\n        producer.send( message );\n\nThat works and I receive the advisory.\n\nHowever, if send like this:\n\n        MessageProducer producer = session.createProducer( null );\n        producer.send( dest, message );\n\nThe advisory isn\u2019t raised.  I have a unit test to confirm that the message was delivered to the queue and that it fails to raise the advisory.\n\nThe problem is that the second method is about 5x faster than the first.  \n\nI can certainly rewrite my code, but this could lead to bugs where code expects to receive the advisory notice but now there\u2019s a back door to send messages without the advisory message meaning that you could break production code.\n\nOn the list, Timothy Bish noted:\n\n> This is by design as the second case creates an anonymous producer that can send to any destination that it has permission to write to.  Sending that advisory every time an anonymous producer sent a message to a given destination would create a flood of advisories which would not really be of help.\n\nHowever:\n\n> I mean I can create the flood of advisories now anyway. I just have to manually create a non-anonymous producer and it would then send the same number of advisories.\n\n> Now it\u2019s just slower and you\u2019ve put a burden on me to maintain an LRU cache and expiry so that I can have reasonable performance :-(\n\nI think this is a bug.  If you're experiencing floods you can always turn off advisories or be more specific in which queues you would like notifications about.",
