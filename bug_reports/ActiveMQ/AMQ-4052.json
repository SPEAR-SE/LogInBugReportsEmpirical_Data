        "description": "The phenomenon of the bug:\nWhen consumers was killed and restarted frequently, some messages could not be consumed by consumer but they were still in pending messages.\n\nReason:\nWhen consumer consumes messages in transaction, it sends ack command and transaction commit command separately, if the consumer was killed between ack command and transaction commit command, in other words the Broker only received the ack command but did not receive the transaction commit command, this lead to the message in PrefetchSubscription\u2019s dispatched list was set ack true, but was not removed from dispatched list. When the consumer was killed, Queue#removeSubscription() was called, in this method, PrefetchSubscription#remove() was called to put PrefetchSubscription\u2019s pending list and dispatched list to Queue\u2019s redeliveredWaitingDispatch list. After that, when Queue#doDispatch() was called, the redeliveredWaitingDispatch list was transferred to Queue#doActualDispatch () method to dispatch the messages to consumer again. In Queue#doActualDispatch () method, if all consumers isFull() method returns true, the target is null and the expression \u201cinterestCount > 0\u201d become the only condition to judge if the message should be put back to the  redeliveredWaitingDispatch, but now the message\u2019s isAcked() method returns true, this lead to interestCount is 0, and then the message was not put back to redeliveredWaitingDispatch, but it was not consumed and was still in pagedInMessages. \n\nSolution:\nIn PrefetchSubscription#remove() method, set ack status to false for all messages in dispatched list. The code as follows:\n\n{code}\n\n    public List<MessageReference> remove(ConnectionContext context, Destination destination) throws Exception {\n        List<MessageReference> resultList = new ArrayList<MessageReference>();\n        synchronized(pendingLock) {\n            super.remove(context, destination);\n            // Here is a potential problem concerning Inflight stat:\n            // Messages not already committed or rolled back may not be removed from dispatched list at the moment\n            // Except if each commit or rollback callback action comes before remove of subscriber.\n            resultList.addAll(pending.remove(context, destination));\n\n            // Synchronized to DispatchLock\n            synchronized(dispatchLock) {\n                ArrayList<MessageReference> references = new ArrayList<MessageReference>();\n                for (MessageReference msgRef : dispatched) {\n                    if( msgRef.getRegionDestination() == destination) {\n                        references.add(msgRef);\n                        if (msgRef instanceof QueueMessageReference) {\n                        \tQueueMessageReference ref = (QueueMessageReference) msgRef;\n                        \tref.setAcked(false);\n                        }\n                    }\n                }\n                resultList.addAll(references);\n                destination.getDestinationStatistics().getDispatched().subtract(references.size());\n                destination.getDestinationStatistics().getInflight().subtract(references.size());\n                dispatched.removeAll(references);\n            }\n        }\n        \n        return resultList;\n    }\n{code}\n\nThe solution can solve the problem, I want to know if the solution can lead to other problems.",
