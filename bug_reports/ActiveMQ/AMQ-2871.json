        "description": "I have a fairly simple set-up with a single Activemq.\n\nOn that AMQ we have a few queue's and topics, where the topics are filled using PHP producers with Stomp and four Java subscribers with the normal openwire protocol (via a Spring jms listener container). The PHP producers are created on demand and send a single, tiny text message when some data needs to be adjusted in the Java subscribers.\n\nThe problem is that all four consumers sometimes receive a message without such a text body. Using tcpdump I deciphered that the incoming Stomp-message actually did have a body, so the senders work correctly. Again using tcpdump I noticed the messages on the openwire channel are sometimes empty, so the problem seems to be with the ActiveMQ server part.\n\nNot all messages fail, but its way too common (a rough estimate would be one in ten or so). I also didn't see any message empty when using a OpenWire-producer.\n\nMy configuration is rather trivial, its the default config without systemusage and destinationpolicy. With the stomp and openwire transporters like so:\n<transportConnector name=\"stomp\" uri=\"stomp://0.0.0.0:61613?transport.closeAsync=false\"/>\n\n\nWhen logging the messages in the subscribers, it looks like this for a correct one:\nActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 3, responseRequired = false, messageId = ID:argus-38958-1279890714168-2:66257231:-1:1:1, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:argus-38958-1279890714168-2:66257231:-1:1, destination = topic://pw_cache_products, transactionId = null, expiration = 0, timestamp = 1281801902987, arrival = 0, brokerInTime = 1281801902987, brokerOutTime = 1281801902988, correlationId = null, replyTo = null, persistent = false, type = null, priority = 0, groupID = null, groupSequence = 0, targetConsumerId = null, compressed = false, userID = null, content = null, marshalledProperties = null, dataStructure = null, redeliveryCounter = 0, size = 0, properties = null, readOnlyProperties = true, readOnlyBody = true, droppable = false, text = views 0}\n\nAnd like this for an incorrect one:\nActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 3, responseRequired = false, messageId = ID:argus-38958-1279890714168-2:66384399:-1:1:1, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:argus-38958-1279890714168-2:66384399:-1:1, destination = topic://pw_cache_products, transactionId = null, expiration = 0, timestamp = 1281805503252, arrival = 0, brokerInTime = 1281805503252, brokerOutTime = 1281805503252, correlationId = null, replyTo = null, persistent = false, type = null, priority = 0, groupID = null, groupSequence = 0, targetConsumerId = null, compressed = false, userID = null, content = null, marshalledProperties = null, dataStructure = null, redeliveryCounter = 0, size = 0, properties = null, readOnlyProperties = true, readOnlyBody = true, droppable = false, text = null}\n\nI.e. text = null vs text = views 0\n\nI couldn't reproduce this on another system so far. And my production ActiveMQ that displays this behaviour gets way to much traffic to put in in debug-logging-mode (and I doubt that will offer much insight anyway?). I can reproduce it on a newly created topic on the same activemq with only one consumer and producer, but not on a separate activemq. Whether that is because it has less load or whatever I don't know, the original activemq that does exhibit this behaviour has been upgraded and restarted several times since we first started noticing the problems that led to this discovery.\n\nMy consumers and producers are about the most trivial variants you can think off, but the other producers and consumers obviously aren't.",
