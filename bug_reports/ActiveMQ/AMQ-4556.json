        "description": "This issue seems to relate to AMQ-2009 and the referenced articles there.\n\nh3. The issue:\nAfter a give period of time, the broker seems to \"forget\" about received messages on a queue.\nReceiving of new messages and delivering them is unaffected. Just some are lost in the store.\nChecking the DB tables, the missing messages do exists there.\nActiveMQ statistics counters are also aware of them and count those messages as \"pending\" in the ActiveMQ console (first colummn). But open the details of a queue in ActiveMQ console do not show them at all.\n\nh3. Analysis so far\nWe tried several settings for the queues which had no impact on the issue:\n* Activating/Deactivating useCache\n* Setting different prefetch values from 0, 1, 100 (at least 1 seems to relax the issue a little bit)\n* KahaDB and JDBC persistent (Oracle and MSSQL(jTDS)) are affected\n\nAlso some characteristics about affected/not affected queues might help to analyse this further:\n* We have one queue with just one producer and many consumers whereas the message is quite small (just headers): No problem on that queue even after thousend of messages\n* Queues with multiple producers and consumers and payloaded text-messages seem to be unaffected - Maybe the JDBC persistent store trottels the processing enough to \"solve\" the issue\n* Queues with multiple producers and consumers and small messages (just headers) seem to \"enable\" the issue. Even with few messages the issue appears\n\nh3. \"Recovering\" lost messages\nShutdown the (master) broker and restart it. With failover transport this happens transparent for the clients.\nOn master startup, all messages from the store (DB) are scanned and \"rediscovered\"\n\nh3. Workaround\nUse another cursor - VM seems to be fine. Additional settings might be required to handle shotcommings of the VM cursor (max memory, queue memory etc.)\n{code:xml}\n                <policyEntry queue=\">\" ...>\n                  <pendingQueuePolicy>\n                    <vmQueueCursor/>\n                  <\/pendingQueuePolicy>\n                <\/policyEntry>\n{code}\n\nh3. Test code\nI was not able to create a self-contained unit test.\nBut the attached code can be used to reproduce the issue quite reliable.\nIt sends 3000 messages. WIth the following settings it will fail/will work correctly:\n|| Message Size || ActiveMQ cursor || Result ||\n| 1 MB (leave line 20 as it is) | vmQueueCursor | (/) - All messages delivered|\n| 1 MB (leave line 20 as it is) | store based Cursor| (/) - All messages delivered|\n| remove comment from line 20 | vmQueueCursor| (/) - All messages delivered|\n| remove comment from line 20 | store based Cursor| (x) - Some (~0,5% messages lost)|\n\nFor completness also the used activemq-broker.xml was attached - This is the default one with the JDBC persistent store added.",
