        "description": "Executive summary\n---\nWhen an event is about to be delivered to a client while that client simultaneously sends a DISCONNECT message, there's a risk for a deadlock between two threads in ActiveMQ, causing no DISCONNECT receipt as well as \"Already connected\" error if another client connects with the same client ID.\n\n\nDetails\n---\nHere's steps to reproduce, using STOMP, tho it's possible that this issue exists for other protocols also, since the deadlock happens in broker/TransportConnection.java. I could reproduce the error easily with these steps, tho it's entirely possible that some of the steps aren't strictly required but rather provides certain needed timing.\n\n1) Connect to ActiveMQ using STOMP\n\n2) Send a SUBSCRIBE message with destination=/topic/foo, without asking for a receipt. No other options sent in message. \n\n3) Send a message to /topic/foo, without asking for a receipt. Note: It's important that the message is auto-acked by the server.\n\n4) Wait 10ms for message\n\n5) Go right ahead and send DISCONNECT message, asking for a receipt.\n\n5.1) About 20% of the time, the message is never received, nor is the DISCONNECT receipt.\n\n5.2) Run 'jstack -p <activemq pid>', watch how the JVM prints info on stdout about a deadlock between two threads.\n\n\nTest script\n---\nApply the small patch to the perl library Net/Stomp.pm\nIt's a naive minimal patch to make it wait for a receipt for the DISCONNECT message. It will actually just wait for any frame to arrive and won't check what it is, but it's enough for this test.\n\nRun amqtest.pl a few times. A non-buggy run completes almost immediately. A buggy run hangs the script during disconnect.\n\n\nWorkaround\n---\n-When sending the SUBSCRIBE with receipt requested, and waiting for the receipt before sending the SEND, I was unable to reproduce the issue, even after running the script 100000 times.-\nNo, it turns out that the workaround suggested above does not completely eliminate the problem. It probably just introduces a large enough delay to almost always avoid the race condition. After 30000 additional test runs with the script the error occurred again.",
