[Please provide a test case that demonstrates the issue and also test against latest release, 5.12.2 is a bit old., Sorry, only a visual confirmation that with 5.14.0, jconsole still shows a dead-letter queue with attribute DLQ=false, No tests or other information provided to validate this issue, Trying to provide information. See attached JMX output (via jconsole).
DLQ.connector.msgin is a dead-letter queue, but for some reason not marked with the "DLQ" flag.

I'm happy to tackle the issue, would appreciate just a small hint where to start looking in the code., [~lichtin] that flag is set on first usage of a destination as a dlq;
see: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/da9fedead4078cc82efb32e15d8d9cd53c8e82dc/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/RegionBroker.java#L798

some relevant unit tests: org.apache.activemq.broker.policy.DeadLetterTest, Thanks for the pointers.
I'm wondering, is the code path any different when XA is in use?, I wouldn't expect any difference in DLQ being marked as DLQ behaviour in this case. , Working as it was designed, state is not stored to disk and DLQ state of a Queue will be set on first use.  The DLQ can change on successive broker runs based on configuration changes.  ]
