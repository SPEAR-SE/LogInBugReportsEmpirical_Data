https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6151 - respect prioritizeMessages for pending and redelivered messages

(cherry picked from commit 5af5b59d3bf3c84098e55b6cb87631c061990666)
, Within a priority, dispatch order after prefetch needs to be retained.
Having a single merged list breaks this.
Redeliveries still need to be separate, they need to be combined for dispatch or iteration., Commit 2a8218a9a8cfa74e1049249481f601e042f33358 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
