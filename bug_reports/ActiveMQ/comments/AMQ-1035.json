[Case 3 happens also for PHP stomp clients. I saw there was a patch on the mailing list, but unfortunately the link to the patch doesn't work anymore. ActiveMQ should send an error frame and disconnect when a securityexception occurs. Now, it just continues, and the client can read/write messages without any problem, thus the authentication is useless for the stomp protocol., This has been fixed for some time now.]
