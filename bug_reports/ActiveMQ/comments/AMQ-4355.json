[Applied the patch.  Will have to keep any eye on the builds for this failure., Unfortunately this is one of those tests where I can't reproduce the failure, but I've seen it happen a few times on Hudson.  There are a few more like this that.  I'll update if I can get any more useful info on these.
, Can't reproduce, Dejan's latest changes may have fixed this., Great, thanks for closing the loop on this. ]
