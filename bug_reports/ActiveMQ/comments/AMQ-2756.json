[test class, broker activemq_mysql.xml files added, Where can I download version 5.4.1 so I can get this fix?  

If version 5.4.1 is not available yet can you tell me how to get this fix in the 5.3.2 or 5.4.0 version as we are currently using the 5.3.2 version and this will be causing us some headaches.


Thanks., Note the workaround: disable the audit for the JDBC persistence adapter. Full fix is in 5.4.0, This issue is resolved by the duplicate AMQ-2800]
