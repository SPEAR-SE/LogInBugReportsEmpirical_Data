[Hi Sven, Would it be possible to grant an ASF license to your test case? There is a check box in the file upload dialog.  I would like to include a variant in the code base. With the current trunk, (5.3-SNAPSHOT) I see redelivery go 0,1,3 which is still odd. Want to delve a little deeper., scrap the license request, I have been able to reproduce with a simple test case. thanks., https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2087 provides part of the fix., fixed in r739307]
