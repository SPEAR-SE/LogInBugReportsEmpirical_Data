[How do you set this value for the transport connector.

You need to use the following syntax:

failover:(tcp://localhost:61616,tcp://remotehost:61616)?updateURIsURL=<file>
, I am using the following syntax:
         <transportConnector name="nio" uri="nio://0.0.0.0:61616" 
                             updateClusterClients="true" rebalanceClusterClients="true" 
                             updateClusterClientsOnRemove="true" updateClusterFilter="*"
                             updateURIsURL="${activemq.base}/conf/failover.csv"/>

Then the file contains all the computer in the cluster. The docu says it is a comma separated list:
tcp://localhost:61616,tcp://remotehost:61616  is now the content of the failover.csv file. 

At this moment I think you can point to this file from every broker in the cluster and when you add a new computer to the cluster you add the address to this file and the new computer will be used for rebalancing and failover.

I don't know where to add your failover entry. I don't know what is the content of the file. Why is the usage of updateURIsURL in another way than the other attributes?

Can you please give me a full example so I can understand the concept behind. At this moment I am total disoriented.
, Just do the following:

<transportConnector name="nio" 
uri="nio://0.0.0.0:61616?updateClusterClients=true&rebalanceClusterClients=true&updateClusterClientsOnRemove=true&updateClusterFilter=*&updateURIsURL=${activemq.base}/conf/failover.csv"/>


This should work., I have tested these settings but again activemq does not start with no error messages., I have tested these settings too and we still got the same issue. Actually, we have no error message, no warning, no nothing.

Is there any plan to fix this in the near future ?, Cannot reproduce.  If a test case can be provided the reproduces the issue please attach and reopen.]
