[ServiceMix logs. Issue was observed at 2012-10-09 03:26., Inactivity errors can occur for a number of reasons (usually because the connection dropped), perhaps increasing the maxInactivityDuration setting will help.  , does this look like a problem with the connection pool, not removing connections that error out?

Enable debug logging and tracing on your transport connector and you will see inactivity timeout negotiation. you should be able to disable it but maybe there is some issue in 5.4.2 in that regard. The logging will give u full information.
As a workaround, u may need to configure the 0 inactivity timeout on the client side broker url tcp transport., No further feedback from the reporter with logs or other details.  ]
