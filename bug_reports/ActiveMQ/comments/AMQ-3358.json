[Just based on the provided stack trace it looks like it's a bug in the JVM.  The JVM provides the JMX connection handling implementation.  The ActiveMQ ManagementContext is just registering objects in the JVM's JMX server implementation and that does not use any connections at all.
, Hiram, thank you for the fast response, I will look into the client and make sure it is closing connections to the server. Otherwise, hopefully the JVM has a setting to drop these abandoned connections., Just played with this a bit with JConsole and provisioning threads using VisualVM. When connecting to amq connector (port 1099 by default), the thread will be in thread state for two more minutes (JVM default) after closing the connection. And after that period they will be gone. Also

{code}-Djmx.remote.x.server.connection.timeout=0{code}

seems to work for configuring this timeout value, Downgraded the Hyperic HQ Agent from 4.5.1 to 4.4.0, which stops the threads from being created. Clearly a regression with the Hyperic HQ release.

Tried setting -Djmx.remote.x.server.connection.timeout=30000 but the JVM did not close the unused connections/threads.]
