[I've attached a unit test, I've not been able to find an easy way though to actually test that the Destination is completely removed.

, Potential Patch for this issue.  Probably need someone with more knowledge of the broker internals to ensure this won't break anything., Gary, can you take a look at this one for me, we talked about this issue in December, would like to get your input on what I've found., This doesn't seem to be a complete fix.  AFAICT the subscriptions still have the references to any messages that were in the queue when it was destroyed.  Trying to recreate the queue results in recovery failures as these references don't find the messages they refer to.

I have to say I'm confused about what should happen when you destroyDestination for a destination that has active consumers and messages in it.  In the case I am working with the consumer was discarded without being closed so it doesn't much matter what state the client end of the consumer is in but I wonder what should happen if the consumer is actually being used., patch applied and modified test included, thanks. r734524

The remove implementation takes a timeout option, if the timeout is 0, it errors if there are consumers.
if the timeout > 0 it removes the subscribers and disposes the queue, which should purge the queue.

So to Davids question, I guess a removeDestination where the destination has messages should delete the messages, that is purge the store.]
