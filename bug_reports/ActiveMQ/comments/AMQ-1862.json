[I deploy brokers clustering topology as pure master/slave. , I have noticed the same.
It was not even necessary to kill the slave, the following procedure reproduced the same behaviour using this sequence of steps:

- start the master
- start the slave
- stop the slave gracefully (CTRL+C in slave console)
- try to browse any of the master's queues. It will raise the above exception in the browser window.

We also connected JMX console to the master broker after the slave's shutdown and noticed that JMX did not show any queues anymore. However, under the Brokers MBean properties, the Queues  still show up in the property called "Queues" of type javax.management.ObjectName[].

We tested using 5.3.0.5-fuse. 

This kind of makes pure master/slave unusable IMHO. , Does trunk or a 5.4-SNAPSHOT behave the same?, I had the same problem.

The fact that Master halts in case of Slave failure seriously cripples the usefulness of "pure master/slave" which otherwise might been a suitable option for some solutions...

Agree with Torsten Mielke comment:
"This kind of makes pure master/slave unusable IMHO"
, There is a shutdownOnSlaveFailure attribute on the broker that will ensure that a master dies when the slave dies, both need to be restarted to continue., Pure master/slave removed in upcoming v5.8.0]
