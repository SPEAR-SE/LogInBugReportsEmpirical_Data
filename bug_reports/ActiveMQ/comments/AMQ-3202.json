[The ActiveMQMapMessage command needs to implement the serialization method readResolve in order to ensure that the transient Map object is created on when the object is de-serialized from the XML stream., Fixed in trunk, Would you provide the revision number for this fix?, Looks like:
  FIX:  http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1078312&view=rev
  TEST: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1078311&view=rev

Is that right?
, Yes, you can see that by looking at the subversion commits tab for this issue.]
