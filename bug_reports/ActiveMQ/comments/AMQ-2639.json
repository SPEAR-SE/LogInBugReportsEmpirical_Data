[You can add the following jar to the classpath as workaround :

http://mirrors.ibiblio.org/pub/mirrors/maven2/org/apache/geronimo/specs/geronimo-annotation_1.1_spec/1.0.1/geronimo-annotation_1.1_spec-1.0.1.jar

, maybe the activemq devs should just add it to the classpath as default. It does not hurt even on sun jdk.. wdyt ?, ActiveMQ now requires JDK 1.6.  Reopen if still an issue with latest versions, reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
