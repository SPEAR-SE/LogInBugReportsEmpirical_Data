[Initial work introduces OpenWire v11 which adds the noLocal value to the SubscriptionInfo command.  This allows the store to persist the complete subscription information.  KahaDB can be configured on what version of the OpenWire marshallers to use via the setStoreOpenWireVersion accessor (default is currently v6)., The final bit of this is to up the openwire version that we use in the KahaDB store to v11, current default is v6.  This would cause any existing stores that people tried to reuse when updating the broker (not recommended but people do it).  We currently do track the version used in the store in the index metadata so the solution would be to ignore the default or any set value and use the one from the existing store and log a warning that some newer broker features may not work while operating with a legacy store., Broker will now default to the latest openwire version v11 marshallers in the KahaDB store but fallback to the version that was used in an existing store.  ]
