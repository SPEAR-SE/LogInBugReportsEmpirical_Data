[Fix for the command agent that allows the user to specify a username and a password for the command agent with the following syntax:

  <commandAgent xmlns="http://activemq.org/config/1.0" brokerUser="admin" brokerPassword="veryverysecret"/>

The two parameters are optional, if they're not specified the broker connects without authentication.

Futher this path changes to usage of vm://localhost to a lookup via the broker registry (just like in the web-console).
