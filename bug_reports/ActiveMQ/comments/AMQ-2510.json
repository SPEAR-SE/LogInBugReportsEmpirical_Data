[SNAPSHOTS are all in repo: https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/

eg: core jar at https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/activemq-core/
, ah, but I see the source jars are not there.. ok. sorry, some coffee needed., Could you please also try to publish the complete sources along the activemq-all jar?
For 5.3.0 only an almost empty sources jar was deployed:
https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/activemq/activemq-all/5.3.0/, Fixed with svn revision 911811.

The new profile 'deploy' has been created, which can be used to create source and javadoc jars, which can then be deployed to the repo. Generally, you'll use 

{code}mvn clean deploy -Pdeploy -Dtest=0{code}

to do this.

This has been done for both trunk and 5.3 branch (https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/) and Hudson jobs are created that should do this on daily basis.
