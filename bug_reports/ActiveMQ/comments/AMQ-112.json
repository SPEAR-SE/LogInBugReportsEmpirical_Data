[Fancy taking a looksie at this one?, mmm- a tough one! If the message is acknowledged - then dispatched to the Message Listener - there is a window where the client application could die before seeing the message, but after the acknowledgement has been sent to the broker. This would result in the message being lost for good.

I assume this issue arose using Session.CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE mode ?, Yes, it was in Client.Acknowledged mode.  

I didn't see where the code was sending information to the broker, so won't the broker still retain a copy even if the client fails?  It's been a while since i've read the code, so I could be wrong., moved acknowledge call to before message is delivered to a MessageListener]
