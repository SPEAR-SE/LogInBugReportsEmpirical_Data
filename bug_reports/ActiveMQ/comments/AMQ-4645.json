[diff now applied correctly. Additional tests to validate, The subject title of this JIRA is a bit misleading and it should be "The lease-database-locker does not work properly slave broker system clock is ahead of Database server". So it was a problem only when the slave broker system clock is ahead of the Database server but not behind., Minor nitpick: Title is missing "if", and system is misspelled.]
