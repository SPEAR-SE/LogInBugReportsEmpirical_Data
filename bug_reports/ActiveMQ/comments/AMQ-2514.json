[changed the nabble thread url., post your spring xml here also, it may help to tie it together. Did you notice: "NOTE: Turn off the "cacheSessions" flag on JBoss 4.0 to make JMS message reception properly participate in XA transactions, where JBoss requires each listener thread to reobtain its JMS Session for each receive attempt." from http://www.jdocs.com/spring/2.0.RC1/org/springframework/jms/listener/DefaultMessageListenerContainer.html - wonder if that is relevant.

, As suggested I am posting the spring config.  
, Think the answer is somewhere in here: http://static.springsource.org/spring/docs/2.5.x/reference/transaction.html
from the AMQ perspective, all it can do is present an XA capable connection factory. 
The key component that is missing is some wrapper around the connection factory that will enlist connections and sessions in the current XA transaction. This needs to be managed by spring in some way but it probably needs some directive or annotation to make this happen. In the case of jboss using CMT, jboss would provide the wrapper around the Activemq JMS connection factory and ensure that it is enlisted., Try with 5.9 release where the JCA RAR has been improved a lot and tested on JBoss AS etc.]
