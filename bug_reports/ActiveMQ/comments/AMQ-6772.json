[the priority support is not a good candidate for runtime modification because not only do the in-memory messages need to  retained in priority memory, the store needs to retrieve and store messages in priority order. For this, the store needs a restart which is not practical., Hi Gary,

The requirement why we wanted to check run-time update is, if we wanted to create a new queue for a new application and the server is already running with other queues and topics already being used by other application, we don't want to have to restart the server.
We want to have the ability to update the configuration with the policy.
I don't see a way to set this property while creating the queue from Admin UI.
Please advise.
, use a wildcard policy to enable prioritySupport for all queues and disable it selectively if that is required. In that way any new queue will match the wildcard and get priority support., Will disabling work at run-time if enabling does not work?
Is it not the same Java code that set/resets the run-time configuration?, it won't work at all via the runtimeConfigurationPlugin, you will need a wildcard in the default config to enable it for every queue, this then is applied for queues created at runtime in the normal way.
if you want to selectively disable, you will need to restart. It is a performance tweak to disable it, that may not be relevant in your environment.]
