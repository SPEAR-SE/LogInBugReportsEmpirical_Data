[configuration file and the log file, Just curious if your Java runtime is different (build 1.5.0_15-b04) on your production system environment than your test environment?
, Just checked and they are the same. In our test environment, it even starts with less heap memory (-Xmx512M). 
The test environment is used for the functionality testing and not for the stress testing. , I don't know the internal workings of AMQ but I find it a bit strange that the message is being encoded again before it is stored as a blob in the database. May be I am mistaking. , Can't reproduce on trunk. Can you add a test case ?]
