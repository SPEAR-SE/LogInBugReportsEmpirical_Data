[host name resolution is up to the OS, what do you expect here, where do you think the bug is?, I am expecting that the "use loclahost" options switch stops AMQ from trying to resolve the host name via DNS . 

For example machine has a host name of myhost . There is no DNS record for this host name . Thus attempts to resolve will fail. However the transport connector can be configured with an IP making the host name ( ands is resolvability ) irrelevant. , see resolution of https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2776 which is similar. The local host name resolution is now conditional on useLocalHost  which now defaults to false which should avoid your issue.]
