[it looks like the forwarding is happening after a restart b/c on a start the broker id is generated if it is not specified.
In your scenario you should set the brokerId to the brokerName <broker brokerName="X" brokerId="X" ...>
By default a network bridge will not replay back to the origin and having an explicit brokerId will insure that.
In some cases, where a consumer will migrate between brokers it is desirable to allow replay to the original broker.
There is a policy entry on a destination that will allow that via a modified networkBridgeFilter.
see "Stuck Messages" in http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html and the use of conditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory, Configuration issue, please move to the users mailing list for help on broker configuration. , Sorry we really though this was a bug, but I can confirmed configuration errors, but not related to brokerId. 
Will take my supplementaries on the users mailing list instead.

Peace.
