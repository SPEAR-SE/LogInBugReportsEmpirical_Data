[Patch applied, many thanks Neil!, I'm not entirely sure if this is related to this fix, but I just downloaded a "3.0" snapshot (which the source unpacks with "3.1" in the directory name), and I get the following messages with a client connecting to a separate broker on the same machine that IS running before the client starts up.

The client creates a connection factory as follows:

ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("zeroconf:_activemq.broker.development.");

The first failure line does not show up on the actual broker logs as a trial connection, it's as if the JmDNS listener doesn't detect a local-to-the-machine broker until about 30 seconds has elapsed.  Maybe the initial 500ms-30000ms timeout escalation is too small, then too big?]
