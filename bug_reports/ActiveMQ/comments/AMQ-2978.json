[I'm attaching a test case, running a number of identical actions sequentially on an embedded broker with a tcp connector:
1.-Adquire connection.
2.-Start connection
3.-Send a message
4.-Stop connection
5.-Close connection.

The ConnectionFactory has a TransportListener set to count the number of interruptions on the transport. In my environment, it fails arround 10-20 times of 500., Cannot reproduce this using trunk.]
