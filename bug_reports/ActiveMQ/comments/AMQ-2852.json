[I still have this issue with ActiveMQ 5.4.1., The same with 5.4.2, here is the log output:

SEVERE: The web application [/webapp] appears to have started a thread named [AMQPersistenceAdaptor Task] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.

addition of org.apache.activemq.thread.DefaultThreadPools#shutdown to allow the default pool to be shutdown on undeploy., additional broker improvements in r1049527 - have discovery agent and network connector delegate to the common pool that can be explicitly shutdown., still seems to be an issue with the amq persistence adapter{code}SEVERE: The web application [/web-app] appears to have started a thread named [AMQPersistenceAdaptor Task] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.{code}, fixed up AMQStore piece in revision - http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1084633&view=rev, I am using AMQ 5.5 using embedded mode with no persistent listening for external producer connectors and consumed via VM connector. Still see the issue

turn on persistent still see the issue ( <amq:broker useJmx="true" persistent="true" advisorySupport="false"> )

SEVERE: The web application [/mc] appears to have started a thread named [ActiveMQ Task-20] but has failed to stop it. This is very likely to create a memory leak.

Any suggestion?, The bug persists in ActiveMQ 5.5, I have created a new issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3451.]
