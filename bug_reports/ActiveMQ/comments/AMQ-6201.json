[I wrote my own client to check when the exception occurs. It happens when the connection.start() and connection.stop() are not invoked before doing a connection.close().
, This is expected behavior when a stream closes unexpectedly, such as when a connection is killed improperly.  That being said, calling connection.close() should work fine and properly stop the connection first.  I do not see that exception when calling close on a connection.  I would attempt to reproduce this in a unit test if possible to show that connection.close() is causing this issue without calling stop first because it works properly whenever I test it., Not test provided to prove the existence of an issue here.]
