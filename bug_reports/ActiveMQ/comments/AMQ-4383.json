[The proton libs are in the FuseSource repo.

Its possible there was some connectivity issue when you tried to build., Artifacts are in the repo and local builds here pull then down fine. , Upgrading to Maven3 solved the issue. With Maven 1, the dependencies were not searched from repo.fusesource.com automatically. Thanks for the help guys., Guys, is there workaround for M2 maven?, When using a maven proxy the fuse repository has to be explicitly added to the maven proxy ( Nexus in our case ).  Fuse has duplicates of many common jars found in the public repository.  So it is not easy to add the http://repo.fusesource.com repository to our proxy, due to trust and security issues with common jars.  This means we have to resort to manually adding the fuse dependencies to our proxy just to bring in the activemq-apollo dependency successfully.  

It seems like a bad practice to have a public repository artifact depend on third party repositories.]
