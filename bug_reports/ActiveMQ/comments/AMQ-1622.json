[I too am confused by this, but instead of swapping them, I propose changing this to "messages enqueued" and "messages dequeued" which cannot be misinterpreted, and this matches what you would see via JMX. The problem with "sent" and "received" is that it's ambiguous, because it raises the question "by whom". Messages are sent from producer to broker and then sent from broker to consumer. They are received by the broker, then received by the consumer. So a column that says "messages sent" or "messages received" inherently will be confusing., Headings changed to enqueued/dequeued in SVN revision 763765]
