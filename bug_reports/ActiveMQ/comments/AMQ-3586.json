[What are you using to create the Queue's web console, admin tool?  The web console was patched no to long ago to trim leading and trailing whitespace from the forms to prevent this sort of thing., We created the destination's names with the standard activemq web console. It still seems to be possible (5.5.0).
I even got to manage it that the identical message was sent to '123' and '123 ', although I addressed only one of them (also through the web console)., It shouldn't have this issue if you use the 5.6-SNAPSHOT., Fix applied in trunk to prevent the other tools like jconsole or command line from letting spaces into the ends of the destination names, will be in the next snapshot.]
