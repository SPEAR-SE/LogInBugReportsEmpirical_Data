[Do you have a test case for this?  Have you tried using a 5.6-SNAPSHOT?, No feedback from the reporter on test case or reproduction of the issue.  , I have similar problem myself, Unfortunately don't have a consistent steps to reproduce this problem. I would suggest to keep the activeMQ running for days and keep adding and deleting topics, try to make the consumers slow in processing and kill this topic. Eventually you can reproduce this problem.]
