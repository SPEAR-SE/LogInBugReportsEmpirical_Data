[Current workaround is to 
Removing pax-url-aether-1.5.2.jar and disabling logQuery in activemq.conf 

   <!-- Allows accessing the server log -->
    <!--bean id="logQuery" class="org.fusesource.insight.log.log4j.Log4jLogQuery"
          lazy-init="false" scope="singleton"
          init-method="start" destroy-method="stop">
    </bean-->
, It worked for us, thanks
Anselme, This is now fixed on trunk by upgrading log-insight, which now don't use pax-url-aether jar, but shades what it needs so there's no clash in guava version. I incidentally upgraded Jackson to 2.4.1 version, For Dejan's solution,  could you give more details?   I am using  5.10.0.

which file is  log-insight that I need to upgrade?

Thanks, Kevin: Download insight-log4j-7.2.0.redhat-060.jar and insight-log-core-7.2.0.redhat-060.jar from, for example, http://search.maven.org/#search%7Cga%7C1%7Cinsight-log

Remove the 7.2.0-redhat-024 versions from $ACTIVEMQ_HOME/lib and the place the newly downloaded jar files in there. Also remove pax-url-aether-1.5.2.jar from the same directory.

I have LevelDB working with shared storage on 5.10.0 just by doing that. Thank you, Dejan.]
