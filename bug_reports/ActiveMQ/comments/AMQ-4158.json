[Patch applied, thanks., Unfortunately my first fix did not work.  I will attach another patch which should.  It converts several tests to JUnit4, add's timeouts in the @Test annotation, and moves the code that I think was causing the hang out of setup()
, Converted tests to JUnit 4 and added timeouts to prevent windows hangs
, Unfortunately the patch is not able to be applied cleanly with the recent refactorings in trunk., Reworked the patch so it would apply to the new layout, changes added in trunk. ]
