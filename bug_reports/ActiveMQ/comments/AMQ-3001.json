[When a durable is forwarded through a network a well known durable subscriber needs to be created that can out live the original, so if there is a partition, there will be no loss of messages for the networked durable.
They use the prefix,NC-DS, (network connector durable sub) prefix comprised of the the local broker and destination physical name, see org.apache.activemq.network.DurableConduitBridge#getSubscriberName

The expectation is that the connection associated with the durable sub will change when the same durable again subscribes, the point being that the nc-ds can outlive the new connection.

The dynamicOnly property of a network connector can controll whether the nc-ds is activated on startup, when true, the NC-DS will only be activated when the original durable sub again (dynamically) reconnects. With dynamicOnly=true, it is possible to miss messages when disconnected, so it defaults to false.

The NC-DS-xx will only be deleted when the original durable sub unsubscribes., Added a faq entry "I see NC- client-ids, what does that mean?" to explain: https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=24184563
