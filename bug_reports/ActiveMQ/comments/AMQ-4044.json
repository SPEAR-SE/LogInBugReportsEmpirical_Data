[thought: looks like two log4j appenders are in the mix, It looks as though we have multiple shutdown hooks registered, I noticed this the other day when I noticed some of the tests also doing this multiple stopping / shutdown logging., Threw in a couple quick logs statements: here's who's calling it twice from the console.

, Yeah I had a hunch it was a shutdown hook, kicking in at the same time., Its the same if you do bin/activemq start and then stop it later
