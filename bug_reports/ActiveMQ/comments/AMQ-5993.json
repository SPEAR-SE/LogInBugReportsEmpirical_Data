[Was your Queue configured to use [prioritized messages|http://activemq.apache.org/how-can-i-support-priority-queues.html] ?  I recently ran into an OOM error when using prioritized messages and purging which I am investigating now., Message priority wasn't used in my case.

Since creating the issue, I've increased system memory to 8 GB and heap size to 2 GB. I'll report if the error recurs, but for now, the system seems to be in healthier condition, with over 5 GB free memory when counting OS caches and around 1 GB actual free memory., Closing this issue for now as modifying configuration seems to have resolved the issue. If the problem occurs again and can be reproduced, it can be re-opened to investigate.]
