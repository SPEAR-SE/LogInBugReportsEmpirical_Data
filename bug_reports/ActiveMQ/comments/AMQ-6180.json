[It looks like the plugin that pulls in snippets is no longer working.  Also, we were pointing to an old subversion respository that wasn't being updated anymore.

Seeing as how the source code has been moved to git and that the snippet plugin wasn't working I went ahead and just copied the xml examples into code blocks inline to fix the issue.  I think I got all of them but we can always fix an example later if I missed one.]
