[You are missing the authentification on the networkConnector .

The default username / password couple are "system" and "manager"

modify your network connector as follow:

<networkConnector name="host1 and host2" uri="static://(tcp://host1:61616,tcp://host2:61616)" userName="system" password="manager"/>

This should solve the issue, Appears to be a configuration issue.  Lacks a test case for confirmation.  A solution is provided in the comments. ]
