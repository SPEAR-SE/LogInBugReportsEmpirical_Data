[Yes, this one is in need of some refactoring.  , I split this up into 5 parts, DurableSubscriptionOfflineTest, DurableSubscriptionOffline1Test, DurableSubscriptionOffline2Test, DurableSubscriptionOffline3Test, and DurableSubscriptionOffline4Test, using JUnit4 Parameterized instead of CombinationTestSupport.

This will make debugging easier, and also eliminate problems sometimes seen with CombinationTestSupport and AutoFailTestSupport.

The testOrderOnActivateDeactivate test case is still failing and still needs to be resolved.
, I increased the number of iterations on this test b/c it was relevant to the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4952 but I could not get the test to fail  - testOrderOnActivateDeactivate that is. I wonder if the test can be tweaked to demo the failure reliably.
Or maybe the test is fixed by the changes for AMQ-4952 :-)
, Looks like this was fixed by Gary's changes for AMQ-4952.  I removed the @Ignore for this test.
