[Patch for 5.13.x branch.

The existing check for half hour offsets wasn't in 24 hour clock format (8pm == 20h)., Patch for master branch.

The check for half hour timezone assumed 12 hr clock instead of 24 hr. 
Updated to check for 20h instead of 8h., Commit 0f445a535f8ec1135d6769a9e7c1503fd7b26121 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Thanks to Jamie Goodyear for the patch
