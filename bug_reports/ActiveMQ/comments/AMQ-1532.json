[BTW we should have a wiki page describing how to use the Java Service Wrapper with ActiveMQ. I've found this page...

http://activemq.apache.org/unix-service.html

we should also link that to the new Java Service Wrapper page. Also adding links from this page to it would be good too...
http://activemq.apache.org/run-broker.html, Minor changes committed to rev 608064.

Wiki page added here: http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/Java+Service+Wrapper
