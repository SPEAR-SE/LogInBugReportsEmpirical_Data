[Without more information there is little that can be done here, we'd need broker logs and if possible a test that can reproduce the situation or a copy of the faulty index / journal to determine what might have gone wrong., We have faced the same situation for the 3rd time now, this looks the same as reported in AMQ-3098.

I can provide a copy of the ActiveMQ logs and a copy of the Kahadb in the state it was in when it went south.

Fundamentally though I think the KahaDB db/txn log allocation is flawed, because it ought to (IMHO) pre-allocate logs as per the sizes specified to ensure it 'grabs' the allocated space and then can't lose a chance to allocate one in some future time (when sadly the disk fills up).

In our case what was happening was that rsyslog could not route some application logs downstream, and started stalling the consumer application (the one doing the logging) so the Queue built up, and eventually when rsyslog had starved the local disk, ActiveMQ could not correctly allocate any more redo log space, and throwing the error.

It is unrecoverable at this point, I've tried moving aside Kaha individual log files, but it doesn't help, the whole KahaDB data store needs to be purged, and then ActiveMQ restarted.
