[Which version you are using? 5.7?, yes, I tried the set up you described:

Two brokers, networked with the activemq-static-broker1.xml and activemq-static-broker2.xml that come with the distribution. 

Then I set up the web console on broker2, attach consumer to broker1 and producer to broker2... 

Then I go to the web console, click on Queues --> active consumers, and I see the connections for the consumers just fine. Did i miss something? , The connection is not of the consumer but in the list it also shows up connection to the other broker. If you click that then you get that message.

It starts with NC_, I can reproduce. Taking a look now..., Fixed with commit r1439193

Link now points to network bridge page for networked consumers.

If you can check out the next nightly distribution and verify, that would be great.]
