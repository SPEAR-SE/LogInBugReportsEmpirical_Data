Fixing X-Frame-Options header so that is applied for all content served
by Jetty.  The previous patch wasn't correct because it only applied it
to Servlets and JSPs and not static content. This also reverts AMQ-6113

(cherry picked from commit 24ad36778534c5ac888f880837075449169578ad)
, Jetty has been configured to set the header for static content as well., Was this issue properly fixed in the 5.11.x and 5.12.x branches as well?, No, in those versions the header is applied in a Servlet filter so any static content will not be protected which is why the notice that went out says to upgrade to 5.13.2.  Fixing older versions like 5.11.x and 5.12.x would require more work than just cherry-picking because the version of Jetty is different.]
