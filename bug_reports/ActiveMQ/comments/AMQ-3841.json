[Stack trace from starting up the broker with a deleted queue., Unit test that can reproduce this issue., Fixed in trunk test updated to show that a destination can be removed and then later re-added without issue., I have one comment on the patch that fixes this issue. The KahaDBStore.getDestinations() method looks as though it would be pretty heavy, performance wise. Should the resultant List be cached instead of retrieved twice, once for .size() and once for .toArray() (lines 321 & 322)?, Done, updated in trunk, should see it in the next nightly.]
