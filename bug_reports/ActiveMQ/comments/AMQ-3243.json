[Did you disable Message priority sorting on the client side?  You can use setMessagePrioritySupported(false) on the Connection or ConnectionFactory to do that, or use the URI syntax.  Disabling this will disable the basic message priority sorting that the client consumer does.  

If that doesn't help you might want to submit a test case that demonstrates the issue you are seeing and shows what you expect., Issue seems to be related to configuration of the client, no input from the reporter so closing this.  ]
