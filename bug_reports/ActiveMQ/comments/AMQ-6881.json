[This appears to be a issue more so with the Proton-J library which isn't validating the attach and providing a suitable error to the broker so it has no idea that the attach is not valid.  I'd recommend creating an issue on the [Qpid Proton JIRA|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON] tracker for this as that's where it'd need to be addressed.  , Thank you. I've opened PROTON-1740. Would you like me to go ahead and close this issue?]
