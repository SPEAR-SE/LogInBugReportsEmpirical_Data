[The removal is intentional see: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4599
For the 1.7 jni deps - maybe the uber jar will suffice:
http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/fusesource/leveldbjni/leveldbjni-all/1.7/, Unfortunately, the leveldbjni-all does not contain the platform-specific libraries (.so or .dll). The only option, which seems to work just fine, is to copy the leveldbjn-1.8.jar over to the lib/optional of the 5.9.0 instance, then remove the "old" leveldbjni-1.7.jar and finally copy the leveldbjni-<platform>-1.8.jar.

I have a native leveldb v 1.7 installed and the v1.8 jni libraries seem to work just fine with it - I ran some simple smoke-tests against it and things seem to work just fine.

However, on a different note: the performance of the Java implementation seems very close to the native implementation, at least in a non-high-concurrency environment, and hence the potential gain may not warrant the increased complexity of having an external native component.

I guess I should close this issue then since it is not really an issue anymore., Please see my last comment for the reason to actually resolve this issue as "won't fix".]
