[I tested removing :
         <loggingBrokerPlugin/>
plugin,

"Store percent used" increases to around 100% then naturally goes down to 8% and no error occurs
so there is at least a bug due to <loggingBrokerPlugin>
And maybe another in this indicator that kind of worries the administrator although limits are far from being reache.


Thanks for your help.

www.ubik-ingenierie.com, Investigating a little more , "Store percent used" behaviour seems ok.
As I understand the size may vary in the following cases:
- CleanupTask run
- storage of a new message that induces file creation (when file is unused for example ...)

Variations depend on periodicCleanupTask execution which merges files.
Maybe a little note in docs would be helpful.

So bug is more related to <loggingBrokerPlugin>

Is it a normal that reference store size is taken into account in the size of  "Store percent used" beside the normal Journal ?
