[Can you create a unit test to reproduce this? Or at the very least give broker configs, more detailed logs, and steps to reliably reproduce this? Looks like the index pageFile is null, but no way to know how that happened. , What more logs can I provide?  I have logging set at debug.  Only happens after a couple of restarts so I can't give a reliable set of steps.  It happens after 2-3 restarts.  Not always, but it eventually will always fail after a few restarts.  

If I delete the database completely it goes away (obviously).

This is my log4j setting.

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, out



These are the lines of code where I setup my broker:

		broker = new BrokerService();
		StatisticsBrokerPlugin statisticsPlugin = new StatisticsBrokerPlugin();
		broker.setPlugins(new BrokerPlugin[] { statisticsPlugin });

		String dataDirectory = getDefaultDataDirectory();
		broker.setDataDirectory(dataDirectory);
		broker.setDeleteAllMessagesOnStartup(true);
		File tmpDirectory = new File(getTempDataDirectory());
		broker.setTmpDataDirectory(tmpDirectory);
		boolean enableJMX = Boolean.getBoolean("enableJMX");
		broker.setUseJmx(enableJMX);

		try {
			// by default activemq would try to start jmx rmi server on port
			// 1099, the below code would help to work around it.
			String str = System.getProperty("activemq.jmx.rmi.port");
			if (str != null) {
				int jmxRMIPort = Integer.parseInt(str);
				ManagementContext managementContext = new ManagementContext();
				managementContext.setConnectorPort(jmxRMIPort);
				broker.setManagementContext(managementContext);
			}
		} catch (Exception e) {
		}
		// this is default...but just make sure since some messages are too
		// big too keep directly in memory
		broker.setPersistent(true);

		// broker name must be setup based on domain and container name...
		// we don't use the value from the activemq.xml file...so we force it
		// here
		String brokerName = getBrokerName();
		broker.setBrokerName(brokerName);

		// advisory support MUST be enabled for stuff to work right
		broker.setAdvisorySupport(true);

// bunch of camel stuff in here that I deleted...not sure if you need that.

		broker.start();
		broker.waitUntilStarted();
  
, No test case here to validate.  There are a bunch of fixes in the 5.9-SNAPSHOT so I would suggest testing against that and if you can reproduce then please reopen and attach a test case.  ]
