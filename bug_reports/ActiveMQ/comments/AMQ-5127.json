[Attached MQTTTest.patch which contains the test to reproduce., Attached AMQ-5127.patch for fixing this issue., Tested against the latest 5.10-SNAPSHOT code and the test works fine.  I believe this is already fixed by previous work done on MQTT code.  , Fixed by other MQTT hardening work that's gone into 5.10.  Test added on trunk to ensure it stays fixed. , Hi Timothy Bish ,

 The test added reproduces the issue as it has assertEquals(10, received);. the subscriber should not receive those messages. This behaviour has been verified with mosquitto server. Please, let me know if my understanding is not correct. 

Thanks,
nl , reopening the issue as the behaviour is seen. The AMQ-5127.patch has the fix., Attached AMQ-5127-FixWithTest.patch - Ignore my previous patches. Please review and let me know as we are critically affected by this issue., Hi, 

 any updates on this.

Thanks, hey [~netlancermobi]

I think this is fixed by recent hardening of MQTT. 
Try with new build and let me know.

Thanks, Hi Surf,

 i will check and let you know.

Thanks, This appears to have been fully fixed in the MQTT hardening that went into 5.10.0.  If this is not the case a failing unit tests against the latest source is needed to show the case where it is not working.  Please reopen if additional tests show a problem is still present.  ]
