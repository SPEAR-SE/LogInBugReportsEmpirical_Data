[The test case imports javax.jms.Message and builds an runs fine on every system I've ever used.  Can you elaborate on where you get this error from?, IDEA might have screwed up the svn update. I saw the error in it first, and then confirmed on the command line with `mvn clean test-compile`

however, i just did an svn update from the command line, ran the mvn test-compile and it's fine now.

jumped the gun on some wacky IDEA behavior.
can close this, not a bug. ]
