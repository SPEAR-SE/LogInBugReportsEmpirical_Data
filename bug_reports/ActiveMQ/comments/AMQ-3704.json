[is the broker attribute enableStatistics=false ?, It wasn't set to anything, checked the documentation and saw that the default value was true. Tried explicitly setting it to true but still seeing the same result !!, Any updates here please ?
, Ping., You should attempt to create a Junit test that reproduces the issue., The issue can simply be seen in the output of simple producer/consumer applications that comes with the activemq installation. , No test case provided for reproducing this one.  Seems to be working. ]
