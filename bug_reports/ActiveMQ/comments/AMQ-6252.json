[Since the Broker doesn't know if anyone is even looking at the HealthView bits it wouldn't be optimal to be doing such a heavyweight operation for no good reason which is why there isn't a scheduled task.  The last updated value has some merit although it is hard to settle on what an optimal default for that would be given that everyone would have their own opinion.  , Commit 19fd084a83c990f9fb75a5f2becb48ac808a1b36 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6252

Update for some added thread safety.  Adds method healthStatus that will
regenrate the status from the healthList data which is more intuitive
than the getCurrentStatus which doesn't update state and requires
periodic calls to healthList to capture current metrics.  , Commit cb6c7fb423bb7347bbe62c4ec5e2845302967b59 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~tabish121]

(cherry picked from commit 19fd084a83c990f9fb75a5f2becb48ac808a1b36)
, Fixed thread safety issues and added new method healthStatus that will return a health status string after calling healthList.  This preserves the existing behavior so we don't break anyone while giving you a better entry into the health information in a poller use case. ]
