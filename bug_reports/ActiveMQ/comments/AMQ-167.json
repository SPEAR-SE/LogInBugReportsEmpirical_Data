[Those files were added to the HEAD branch after the 1.x branch was created.  All build so far have been off the 1.x branch.  Thus, thats the reason why they have no shown up in the previous releases.

Those files will be in the next 2.x release.  If you think there will be another 1.x release, let me know and I'll merge those files into the 1.x branch., DOH! Thanks for that Hiram.

No worries about back-porting - we can let this stuff flow right through for 2.x. Its another incentive for folks to upgrade :)]
