[This might have something to do with Windows filepaths.  I just tested this in Linux and it seems to work ok still.

What is the error that you are seeing?, We removed the fileserver webapp, as it's never been production ready. 

It has been deprecated with [AMQ-5754] and removed with [AMQ-6276]. I think there's a room for the embeddable Java web app that serves this purpose, but it should be properly developed as a separate project (not within message broker).

Users are advised to use proper FTP / file servers for transferring blob messages.]
