[I just had a peek at trunk and access to deliveredMessages is properly synchronised. There have been some changes in this area s the line numbers from your stack trace and trunk are off by a margin.

I suspect that this issue is resolved for the upcoming 5.2 release.
It may be worth trying a current 5.3-SNAPSHOT or the RC2 candidate 5.2 release
You can get the binary distributions here:

, No way to reproduce this, user never responded to call for testing on newer version.  Marking as closed.]
