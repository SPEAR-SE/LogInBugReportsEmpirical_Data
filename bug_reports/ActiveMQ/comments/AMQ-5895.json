[thanks for the patch. if you add a junit test case it will be golden! , The fix is in JAXBUtils.java - the rest is unittest., Thanks for the quick reply and sorry about the missing test. I have extended VirtualDestTest (added a unittest that tests basic composite queue filtering and update using runtimeConfigurationPlugin) such that the test will fail if the fix is not implemented in the JABXUtils class. I have updated the activemq.patch file to also include the unittest., Commit 4a603a9936b1880eba501d7f0e6fff812ae29d2f in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
