[The patch doesn't address the real issue here which is that the TransportConnection is continuing to process incoming commands from the its Transport after the detection of a Security violation from the Connection request.  It seems that the safer thing to do here would be to block processing of any additional incoming commands and terminate the connection after sending back a ConnectionError command to the connecting client., Tests all still passing on the CI box, marking as resolved now.  ]
