[While not ideal, it's a 'feature' for JMS clients being implemented over AMQP.  I'd defer modifying the current behavior until a AMQP to JMS spec is finalized and way to enforcing the uniqueness of JMS 'client id' is formalized., What we are currently looking to do for the JMS mapping is use a 'sole-connection-for-container' capability to request that the broker/peer grant exclusive use of a container-id (which will contain the client-id), or fail the connection attempt if it cant. If the broker/peer doesn't support the request, it will then be the clients choice whether to fail or not. This will let clients request JMS 1.1 like client-id behaviour for those that want it..while leaving it possible for brokers to support multiple connections with the same container for those that don't (which e.g might include JMS 2.0 clients)]
