[Added a unit test "JmsSendReceiveWithMessageExpirationTest" in trunk source under activemq-core module that would test consuming of expired messages. You may also try the examples in the distribution by modifying the timeToLive property in build.xml., Please be informed that I am no longer accessible through this email
