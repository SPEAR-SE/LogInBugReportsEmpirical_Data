[I cloned since the original issue cannot be reopened.

Issue still happening in 5.13.0:
sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)
java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:175)
java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.await(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:2039)
java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue.take(ArrayBlockingQueue.java:403)

org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection.ensureConnectionInfoSent(ActiveMQConnection.java:1495)
org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection.start(ActiveMQConnection.java:522)

From the original AMQ-2798 I can see that the patch was never merged, for some reason it is marked as fixed in version 5.5.0 but there this issue is still happening.
From the cloned AMQ-6043 it seems it was closed as incomplete without any verification if the issue still exists (which it does)
, Latest broker version is 5.14.4, have you tested there?
Do you have a reproducer that can demonstrate the issue on the latest broker release?
Have you tried the connectResponseTimeout option on the latest broker release?, Hi,

We have validated that this issue was closed as part of fix AMQ-6362.
It is fixed in version 5.14.0

You can update the implemented version in this issue, and in AMQ-2798 and AMQ-6043.

Thanks,
