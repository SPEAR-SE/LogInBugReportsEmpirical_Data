[This unit test exhibits the problem being reported.  In this test, a "validation" run is made using TCP as the bridge transport --- the race condition does not cause a leak because the remote end of the TCP connection detects the closing of the socket and cleans up the connection.  The "failed" run is made using HTTP as the bridge transport.  On my system, the race condition always occurs and causes the unit test to fail.  With the patch applied, both tests always succeed., Patch to DemandForwardingBridgeSupport which removes the premature call to sendShutdown.countDown.  countDown is already called by the finally clause., Checkin for r808890 added the extra call to sendShutdown.countDown(), Hi

Since duplex connections are very different from non-duplex one, this patch must be carefully test in all conditions. 
Did you launch all ActiveMQ Maven tests and verify that no border effects are discovered ?

Eric-AWL, Noticed this also while doing some work in the bridging code.  ]
