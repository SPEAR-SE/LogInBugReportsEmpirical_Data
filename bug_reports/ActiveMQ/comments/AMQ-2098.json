[Find attached a patch which maps the DataStructure objects into JSON using XStream.

Tests included which check the different types of messages returned - ConnectionInfo, ConsumerInfo, ProducerInfo, Message, Applied the supplied patch, with some additional modifications:

I added some new transformations to the set of XML and JSON transformations so that clients like NMS.Stomp that don't support json can also receive the advisory messages in a format they can digest, namely XML.  The new transformations are 'jms-advisory-xml' and 'jms-advisory-json'.  By default the advisories got out in JSON in keeping with the supplied patch.  I also added two top level transformation for NMS.Stomp to use since it can handle all the transformation types in XML, these are 'jms-xml' and 'jms-json', when these are supplied any Advisory Message, MapMessage or ObjectMessage is encoded into xml or json respectively.  

Added several additional unit tests for my changes along with the ones supplied in the patch.]
