[fix committed in r985993 - unmatched messages are now acked immediately by a durable sub., This error still exists when using the JDBC store.. 

2012-10-02 11:55:57,299 | TRACE | ignoring unmatched selector ack for: ID:java-dev-image-37369-1349171756956-0:1:1:1:1, cleanup will get to this message after subsequent acks. | org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.JDBCTopicMessageStore | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///127.0.0.1:34884

The cleanup will of course never get to this message, as no messages are acked ever..

This exclusion of unmatched selectors happens at
https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/jdbc/JDBCTopicMessageStore.java?r=1345202#to73

It was introduced as a fix to some other bugs in https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/activemq?cs=1025939, need to tackle the jdbc store case - fix needs some investigation.]
