[applied suggestion in r882136, thanks., this seems to have regressed via https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3463

optional imports are missing again., fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1327557&view=rev, I'm wondering about this one... in 5.6 with the new optional dependency on activemq-pool, now Maven users the activemq-camel component will fail OOTB. The default behavior is to use pooling, so it isn't an optional dependency by default :) The workaround right now is to always depend on activemq-pool when using activemq-camel. 

Maybe we should remove that optional tag from the activemq-pool Maven dependency? WDYT?, I'd agree with this, the optional bit seems a bit odd since its pretty much a requirement., the workaround is to manually install the activemq-pool bundle: {code}>osgi:install activemq-pool{code}, I am adding activemq-pool as required dep for activem-camel again. Just as it used to be in 5.5.1 or older.
See ticket AMQ-3847.

Any objections?]
