, The error messages simply point out that the configuration could lead to issues.  The tests themselves don't really need 50gig.  Why its hanging probably doesn't have any relation to the error especially for the test case shown.  You could easily validate this by changing the test to reduce the configured min space requirement and see if it still hangs.  , You are correct. Changed topic and description., The tests aren't really designed to be portable, they are designed to test the various use cases of the Broker.  You may need to make accommodations on your specific machine to allow all tests to run.  I've added autofail to the test case you mentioned which should prevent the hang, it will still fail of course. ]
