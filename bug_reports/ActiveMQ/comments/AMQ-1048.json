[I've added a fix for this in the 4.1 (r475929) and 4.2 (r475901) branch.

The fix is only for the format parameter -QXXX=YYY. The --objname parameter seems to be working fine. I'd try adding quotes to the param when using in WinXP (I'm not sure about linux though). i.e. query "-QTopic=XXX" "--objname" "Type=Topic,Destination=XXX".]
