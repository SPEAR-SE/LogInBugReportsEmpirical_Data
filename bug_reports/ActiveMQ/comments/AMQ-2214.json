[Sample client, server and broker configuration. Watch out for "Got InvalidDestinationException" messages., I see you linked to the AMQ-1176 - did you consider setting watchTopicAdvisories to false for your connectionFactory, this will ensure the the JMS client will send the message to the broker and create the temp destination on the fly. The origin of the current client exception is that it does not yet know about the temp destination but the broker should at this point., No, I didn't. My bad. My excuse for this is that the way I read [the comment about watchTopicAdvisories|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1176?focusedCommentId=38589&page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.issuetabpanels%3Acomment-tabpanel#action_38589]  I gathered that this was a work-around which was no longer needed due to the code change and this only applied to topics.

There is no Javadoc for ActiveMQConnectionFactory.watchTopicAdvisories - is there any description of the implications of setting this to false?

Thanks!]
