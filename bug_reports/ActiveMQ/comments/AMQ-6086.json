https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6086 - test cannot validate all start failures scenarios at this time, suffice that start and stop complete ok
, having some sort of stack of started components is needed here. Pushing (start) aborting if popping has started. A blocking component, like a persistence adapter that will block on a lock acquire - would need to push early and respond to a stop during eventual blocking.
This implies some symmetry between start/stop which makes sense and some consistency in applying the service pattern. Something to keep in mind for the future., Commit 2ffd7498a835be85b08e5ca9966a26a2d4ac0cd3 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~gtully]
