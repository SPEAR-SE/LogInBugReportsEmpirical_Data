[BTW I wonder if you create a thread dump when things are hanging if there is any kind of deadlock in the broker?, We got to the bottom of this. It turned out that there were still some client processes running activemq-3.1-M5 on the network hitting the 4.0.x servers. When took them offline (and then fired them back up with 4.0.2 jars), everything stabilized. If backwards compatibility isn't handled, it'd be nice if there was a graceful degradation; having the servers opaquely cease to be responsive to *any* clients due to the presence of some other old clients was pretty troublesome., This bug is still present in 4.1!

When running Stomp C clients and terminating them the TCP-connection is closed
but still visible in JConsole (see screendump)
