[The Advisory for consumed messages contains the consumed message in its payload.  Have a look at the AdvisoryTests.java in the activemq-unit-tests module.  , The advisory does indeed contain all the needed information., I think it would be handy to add some properties to the advisory - like the orginal messageId, destination etc so that users don't need to leave the JMS API too much to get access to the data, An enhancement issue has been created. ]
