[Patch to resolve this issue., New patch which works with SecurityManager denying access to system properties., I need coffee - let's try this again... :-)
System.getProperties() requires "read,write" on *, not just read., Turns out PropertyOverrideConfigurer isn't what we want.

Instead, we need to look at the beans context and work out if there's another PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer already there, and to only create one for System properties if there isn't.

The attached patch should sort us out., patch applied, thanks Al]
