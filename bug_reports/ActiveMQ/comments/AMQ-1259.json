[Broken pom:

http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/xbean/xbean/3.0/xbean-3.0.pom

Just need to change the <version> tag in the <properties> block to remove the -SNAPSHOT suffix as per the comment in the block, Jira has been filed in xbean: http://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XBEAN-87, Adrian - I know you've been testing this stuff lately - is this issue resolved now?, Looking at the xbean pom and the xbean jira, it seems that this issue is still unresolved. Though with a clean repo it works for me., Fresh build works for me now too.  Looks like the missing snapshot has been published somewhere now., Resolving this issue, since the build is not failing. AFAIK, the xbean problem will be resolved in the next release of xbean also.]
