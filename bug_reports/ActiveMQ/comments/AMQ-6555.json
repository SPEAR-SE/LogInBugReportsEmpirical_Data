[I think the main fix here is to prevent the start method from being called a second time and a check can also be added to the Scheduler as a precaution as well.  However instead of a put if absent it might be better to cancel the old task and then start/add the new one in case the period has changed.  We can log a warning as well.  I can't really think of any current use cases where this would/should happen but figure it's worth putting the check in there as a precaution., Commit 2769298cf64a10cd74320ad132b3677bac20a6cc in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Fixing Scheduler so that a rescheduled task will first cancel the
existing task so it does not get orphaned from the task map.  Also
fixing Topic start so that it will only start once and not twice.
