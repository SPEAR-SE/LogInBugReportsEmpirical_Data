[5.10.0 is very old and no patch releases are going to be done for that version, instead you should use the latest release 5.14.0 first and see if the problem persists, then if you still have an issue create a unit test that can reproduce it., Thanks Timothy for reply.
I will try with the latest release and post the result., Hi Timothy,
The scenario works fine with the 5.14.0 with virtualSelectorCacheBrokerPlugin. I want to know that is that possible to store message(offline message when broker goes down) in db instead of selector.data file?, The data file is the only mechanism for storage at the moment. ]
