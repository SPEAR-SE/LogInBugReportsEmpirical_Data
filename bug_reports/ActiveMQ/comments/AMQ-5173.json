[Have you tested with a current release of ActiveMQ?  The latest release is v5.9.1, 5.9.1 is not an option for us at the moment. I also didn't see any jiras relating to something similar for releases after 5.6 but i'll install 5.9.1 and give it a try., [~tabish121] looks like 5.9.1 does handle this better and does not exhibit this behavior when running the same test. Any idea which jira implemented this fix?]
