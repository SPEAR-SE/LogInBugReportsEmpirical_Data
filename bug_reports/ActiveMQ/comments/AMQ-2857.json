[Attaching patch file which fixes MySqlJDBCAdapter.java.  Tested this locally, and it did appear to fix the issue., variant of patch applied in r985151
added typeStatement attribute to make this configurable for backwards compatibility, default to new ENGINE statement so it will work out of the box with MySQL 5.5
Tanks for the patch. Would be great if you could validate a 5.5 snapshot over the next few days., Downloaded the latest snapshot, and it does appear to be working correctly for me.

One thing I noticed in the class was that the "ENGINE" string is still being used directly when using NDBCLUSTER:

{code}           
l.add("ALTER TABLE "+statements.getFullMessageTableName()+" ENGINE="+NDBCLUSTER);
l.add("ALTER TABLE "+statements.getFullAckTableName()+" ENGINE="+NDBCLUSTER);
l.add("ALTER TABLE "+statements.getFullLockTableName()+" ENGINE="+NDBCLUSTER);
{code}

It looks like NDBCLUSTER was added in MySQL 5.x, so the ENGINE statement will always be correct in the MySQL versions that support it.    It just looks strange that we're using the "typeStatement" variable in some cases but not in others.  Would it be worth changing these lines as well merely for the sake of consistency?]
