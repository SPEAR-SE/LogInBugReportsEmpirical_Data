[Upgrade to fixed version 2.12 is a no-go.

2.12 is not available in maven central seerelated issue

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/XERCESJ-1696, 2.12 exists here :

[http://apache.mirrors.hoobly.com//xerces/j/binaries/Xerces-J-bin.2.12.0.tar.gz]

Its unclear if replacing 2.11 w/ 2.12 will pass the build tests.

Its unclear if there may be other weird inter-depencecy issues within the rest of the libraries.

I would hope that the ActiveMQ team took these thrd party dependency issues on instead of every user having to patch the build., xercesImpl-2.12.0.jar has been uploaded to maven central

[https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/xerces/xercesImpl/2.12.0]

It can be integrated into the dev branch.
