[Working as designed.  The MapMessage contents are lazily unmarshaled as an optimization.  The contents aren't unmarshaled from toString to avoid overhead during the in-flight phase.  You can force an unmarshal by calling a method on the message like getMapNames() and then the toString() would output the map contents.]
