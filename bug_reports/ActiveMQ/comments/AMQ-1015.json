[Please keep the maven-jetty-plugin as this is the new version. The maven-jetty6-plugin is old!

, I've fixed SVN HEAD so that we use an explicit version of the jetty plugin, along with using maven-jetty-plugin  which should fix these issues. I also upgraded to 6.0.1 of Jetty too.

We should backport this to 4.0.x too, I've fixed this for 4.1 - wanna backport to 4.0.x?, Backported to 4.0.x branch. rev 469583]
