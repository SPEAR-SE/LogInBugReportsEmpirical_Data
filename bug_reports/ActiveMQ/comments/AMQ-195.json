[To be able to disambiguate the properties on the reliable/composite channel from those on the individual named collections, we're currently using parenthesis...

e.g.

reliable:(vm://foo?sendCapacity=999&whatnot=456)?maximumRetries=123&another=456


So wrap all the sub-connections in () and append the usual properties to configure reliable/composite style transports]
