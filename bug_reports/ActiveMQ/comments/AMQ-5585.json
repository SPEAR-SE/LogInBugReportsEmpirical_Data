[This is now fixed on master with http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/1cab7138, Hi, Which memory limit are we talking about here - temp usage store or kahadb store?
Because I am seeing an issue where every weekend my ActiceMQ broker stops delivering persistent messages sent on queues to consumers.
Please take a look at this: http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Broker-not-delivering-persistent-messages-to-consumer-on-queue-tp4691245.html, It's probably a different issue as this is only when you move messages using JMX. It'd be good if you could write a test case that reproduces the issue against the current master branch.]
