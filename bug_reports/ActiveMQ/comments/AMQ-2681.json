GenerateJDBCStatements.java will generate the default sql statements for jdbc persistence in spring bean format so people can tune the sql  so I put in in util, Patch applied with svn revision 930206. Thanks Ying. 

GenerateJDBCStatements is useful, but it would be even more useful if it would use specified database dialect as persistence adapters do. You can take a look at JDBCPersistenceAdapter.start() for example on how it can be done. Also, it'd be good to have this as an option that could be executed from the command line, so that folks can create statements, when they're deploying the broker (maybe activemq-admin command with some new switch). Interested in implementing some of these?

Cheers, Will resolve this for now]
