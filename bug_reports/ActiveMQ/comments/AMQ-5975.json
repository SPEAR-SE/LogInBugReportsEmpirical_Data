[This is a client side issue, the specification for STOMP defines that the values in the CONNECT and CONNECTED do not need to be escaped:

{quote}
Escaping is needed to allow header keys and values to contain those frame header delimiting octets as values. The CONNECT and CONNECTED frames do not escape the carriage return, line feed or colon octets in order to remain backward compatible with STOMP 1.0.
{quote}, Is there any specific reason to use ':' in session-id (which is derived from client-id)? Why can't we use any other character in the client-id? The util class do contain a getsanitizedId() method for this purpose only where ':' can cause issues on client side. Using getSanitizedId() should avoid this issue whether we use STOMP protocol v1.0,1.1 or 1.2.

Thanks for the help!

-xabhi, The value used in legal in STOMP in the context of the connection frames.  Changing this long standing format used by the broker now seems ill advised.  ]
