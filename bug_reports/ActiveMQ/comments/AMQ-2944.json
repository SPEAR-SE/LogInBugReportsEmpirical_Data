[Have you tried with the v5.4.1 release of ActiveMQ, there were some changes in the FailoverTransport that might have resolved your issue., I tested with version 5.4.1 and the issue is still present.  Other versions that I tested with and which exhibit the issue are 5.3.1, 5.4.0 & 5.4.1., Can you attach you full broker config.  (activemq.xml), My Activemq.xml configuration file, The code is working as designed, the first transport in the config file is reported to the client upon connection and that value updates the FailoverTransport.  , If the design is to use the first transport in the configuration file (which probably should be documented), then that poses a problem in environments where you require clients to connect via tcp or ssl exclusively (based on each clients connection requirements).  My main concern is that clients that require ssl encryption always connect via ssl because of the security implications.  My workaround has been to put the ssl connection first in the config file which I can live with, but that forces other clients on local network or vpn to reconnect when transport is interrupted via ssl instead of tcp which still works, but is less then optimum.

Wouldn't it make more sense to have clients only reconnect on transports specified in the configured failover transport URI's on the current connection, or am I missing something?, This should be resolved with the changes for updating the cluster client's and not using the broker infos to populate the uri's for the failover transport.
