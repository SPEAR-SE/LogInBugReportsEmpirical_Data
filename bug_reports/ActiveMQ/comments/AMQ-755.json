[I've added a test case to demonstrate this working:

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/trunk/assembly/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/usecases/ThreeBrokerTempQueueNetworkTest.java

Some things to note - (why this test case works)

Firstly - networkTTL - subscription and destination infomation is sensitive to the the networkTTL - which is the number of broker hops this infomation is allowed to be propogated. The default is one - and I couldn't see this parameter being used on the network connector.

Secondly - the asychronous nature that infomation is propagated. When a tempoaray destination is created by a client - it's a synchronous call to it's local broker. Destination infomation (passed around as advisory messages using an embedded DestinationInfo command) are dispatched asynchronously - primarily to avoided issues with network locks.

So you'll notice I've added a sleep for a few seconds between the temporary destination delete and the assertion that the temporary destination is in fact removed from all the connected brokers.]
