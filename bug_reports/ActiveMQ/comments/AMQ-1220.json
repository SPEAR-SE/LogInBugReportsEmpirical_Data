[AFAIK this is just a warning message created due the the underlying socket being terminated; its not an actual problem or bug.

I suspect the broker is just closing an unused connection down because it is no longer being used (it could be the operating system closing the socket too).

You can enable/configure the inactivity timeout on the broker via this link....

, BTW let us know if you think this is still a problem & we can reopen, Hi James

We are using ActiveMq 5.0.0 and we see this exception quite often in our logs. After this exception the connection between the Broker and the client is broken and we have to reconnect the client.  We do have auto-reconnect code in the client so its not a big problem but it would be nice if this didn't happen on the broker side. 

We usually see this exception after a certain number of messages have been sent and it happens even when the Inactivity monitor has been disabled and when broker is still up and running. 

the connect URL we are using is as follows:

tcp://<mymachinename>:61616?jms.useAsyncSend=true&jms.dispatchAsync=true&wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=-1]
