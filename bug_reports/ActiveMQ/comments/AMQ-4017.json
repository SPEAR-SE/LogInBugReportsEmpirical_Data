17:14:06 raul: hey, quick question... what is the dispatchAsync on the network connector used for? is it only used when listening for advisories?
17:24:05 gtully: raul: it is also used for local proxy consumers that will do the forwarding... in fact, I don't think we should use that option for the advisory consumer, it should always be async as a block would propagate back to the broker
17:29:30 raul: gtully, I think it's being used for the advisory consumer at least on 5.5.1: DemandForwardingSubscription.startRemoteBridge, inside the 'demandConsumerInfo' ConsumerInfo
17:30:35 gtully: raul: it is, think that is a bug waiting to happen if folks use dispatchAsync=false
{quote}, fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1381095&view=rev

the network connector advisory consumer is always asyncDispatch
the config flag only effects the local proxy consumers that forward]
