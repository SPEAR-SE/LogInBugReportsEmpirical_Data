[Looking at your patch I think it probably would suffice to check if the "?" lies beyond the last parenthesis instead of searching for the matching set, what do you think?

Also the assert statements in the unit tests have the arguments backwards, the expected result should be first, otherwise the error message is a bit confusing.  , Timothy, yes, you are right I think.  We should only have to check for the last parenthesis.  I was worried about getting confused on an orphan closing parenthesis, but in reality that would seem to indicate a malformed URI, and so in that case we shouldn't have to guarantee any particular behavior.

I've created a new patch that only checks for closing parenthesis and also fixes the backwards assert statements in the unit tests.  I'm going to upload this new patch over the previous one., Patch applied, thanks.]
