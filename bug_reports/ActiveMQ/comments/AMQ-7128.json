[Hi Martin, good to see you!  Yes, the shutdown issue could happen on a stale file lock.  I would look at your OS and logs for the OS, as this will likely be the culprit.  The stale lock is going to be caused by the OS (NFS/SMB/etc) and that may end up requiring some tuning and investigation to see why there is an issue.  I do not think this has to do with ActiveMQ.]
