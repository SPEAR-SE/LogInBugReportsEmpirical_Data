[Fixed with svn revision 954412

The problem was that KahaDB store didn't return a valid message count for the durable subscriber with selector (after the restart), The existing solution can be improved from a performance perspective using the changes in https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2985.
The index, via acklocations contains all of the matched messages so the selectors need not be rerun to determine the available message count etc., r1038296, re implemented getMessageCount to use the just the index and remove the need to re run the selector.]
