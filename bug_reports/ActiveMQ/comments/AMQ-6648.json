[There is not really enough information here to do anything.  What is your configuration and do you have a stacktrace?  Can you better describe what you mean by manually send again and very slow?

If it is possible the best thing would be if you were able to demonstrate an issue with a test case (ie junit or something) to help with debugging., 


Hi,
I describe my phenomenon， 
1、I send 10000 records by PS.
2、8000 success.
3、This time MQ other messages will not be sent
4、MQ will be slow
5、Manual to re send the remaining 2000 messages, will be very slow
    （default seq = 30-58 min per 50 re-send）


I do not know what is the reason, MQ server is not a specific log out,
Could you give me a suggestion


Thanks,
Lewis






, It is not clear what you are doing here and my first guess would be misconfiguration.  I'd recommend going to the users mailing list to get some help with your scenario and broker configuration as there is nothing here to directly call out a broker bug.
