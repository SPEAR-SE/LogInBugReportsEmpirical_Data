[I got the same issue ;  Version 5.10.0, Would be good to offer some additional details on your setup, the files in KahaDB dir etc.  To little to go on as it stands so you need to do some more analysis on your end to help us understand what's going on., I attached my activemq config xml.  

As I was sending this it hit me as to what maybe going on.  I dont know the internals of ActiveMQ or KahaDB, but it appears that one of the two is writing something to the DB even when idle.  If this statement is true then it also makes sense that the size will increase until a journal file is  filled up.  I had mine set to 100kb orginally.  As a test I set the journal size to 1KB.  Now is see the the initialize size was something like 54K.  It increased to 56K but never went beyound that.  It grows and shrinks betweeen 54K and 56K.

, There doesn't seem to be an issue here, the index file size will stabilize as reported, newer versions of the broker have additional fixes and improvements to release older journal logs more reliably.  ]
