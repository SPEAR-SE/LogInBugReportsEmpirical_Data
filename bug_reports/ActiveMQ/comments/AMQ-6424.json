[Note: A co-worker of mine experienced the same problem with version 5.13.0  - using default persistence configuration (Kahadb). , I just encountered this issue running Red Hat JBoss A-MQ 6.3.0 both in production and test environment.
During our last test run I saw as many as 24 levels of DLQ! We are running on RHEL 6.8 with a customized kahadb configuration. 
I am unable to reliably reproduce the issue unfortunately., as a possible workaround you could provide a "discarding" dead letter strategy for queues of the form "DLQ.>" , which would ensure that duplicates from DLQs don't result in further nested DLQ creation.
Getting to the root cause and fixing would need some sort of test to speed up the investigation, Same problem here, however no reliable test case to reproduce the issue (yet)., This has been a very painful problem for us - we are on version 5.9.0.]
