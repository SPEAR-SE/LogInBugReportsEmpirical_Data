[I beleive when you run as a Service from an admin account you need to ensure that the temp dir is created, C:\Windows\System32\config\systemprofile\AppData\Local\Temp

See: AMQ-2946, Configuration issue.  When running as a service the user needs to ensure that the temp dir exists or set an env var pointing to where the temp dir is they want to use.]
