[Patch that clears the originalExpiration property when a message is re-sent and a unit test that fails with AMQ 5.4.2 and passes once the patch is applied., patch looks good and it is great to have a testcase :-)

One thought, I wonder if it makes sense to have the originalExpiration property omitted from a message copy. There is by default a copy of a message before sending by a session.
So I am thinking it may be better to remove that property towards the end of:
org.apache.activemq.command.Message#copy

In org.apache.activemq.broker.region.RegionBroker#sendToDeadLetterQueue the message is stamped after a copy and there is no further copy when it is sent to the DQL.

It may be worth a try.
, Agree with Gary on this one, the Message class copy method is a good place to remove the original expiration property as it really only makes sense when message is on the DLQ.  I've added the supplied unit test along with that fix, tests passing fine now., Fix in trunk, test added, thanks.]
