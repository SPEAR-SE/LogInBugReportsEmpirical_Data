Make the transportConnector configs consistent across all four variants

enabled on the broker side but in later JDK releases that suite is
disbaled as it is insecure so the client side couldn't find a supported
suite.  , Commit 0ac1e23d004392624aa66a56908cb8f20b668b62 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.12.x from [~tabish121]
