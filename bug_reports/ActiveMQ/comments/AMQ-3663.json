[The error indicates that the port that is configured for the AMQ JMX bind is already in use, you need to configure a different port or determine what is occupying this port., Obviously port 20000 is occupied and therefore we see bindingexception. The question is what can occupy this port. The only process on this machine that can occupy port 20000 is ActiveMQ itself.

We configured in activemq.xml port 20000 to be the port that ActiveMq use:
        <transportConnectors>
            <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:20000"/>
        </transportConnectors>

You can see in attached log that activeMQ is running correctly and binding this port. On 2011/11/21 20:38:53 we have scripts that restart ActiveMQ.

I suspect that when restarting ActiveMQ by our scripts, ActiveMQ process which is stopped not releasing port 20000 fast enough so the new process of ActiveMQ fails to bind this port.

, Is it possible for you to test the just the shutdown down via your script and determine how long it takes for the port to be released? Then you should be able to add a sleep either in your script prior to the restart or possibly adding a [jvm clean up timeout|http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-jvm-cleanup-timeout.html] or [startup delay|http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/prop-startup-delay.html] in the wrapper. Additional configuration options for the wrapper can be found at this link: http://wrapper.tanukisoftware.com/doc/english/properties.html
, Thanks 
We will try those solutions to amke sure that JVM fully stopped before we restart ActiveMQ
, Script not waiting long enough for the JVN to shut down., See also AMQ-1967]
