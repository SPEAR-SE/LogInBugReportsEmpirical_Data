[If my original code is not the latest, please apply the changes as appropriate, Unfortunately your patch breaks 5 test cases. I wonder could you try submitting a different patch to solve your problem?, I tested after apply the patch to the turnk (as of yesterday). It still breaks in a couple of  places even without the patch (an example below). I will attach the new patchfile., per my earlier comment, patch to latest trunk., Please ignore the earlier attachment.,

James,

I tried many snapshots going back in 5 day intervals and all the builds fail
for some reason
...  (from
http://people.apache.org/maven-snapshot-repository/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/4.1-incubator-SNAPSHOT/
)

Which SNAPSHOT builds cleanly (I am using maven 2, version 2.0.4) ? Am I
missing something ?

Thanks
Regards

, Hi,
What is the status of applying the provided patch ?
I have uploaded patch for the 4.1 code base (file name: dnc4.1lpatch.txt).

Please let me know if I can help in expediting this.
Thanks
Regards
- Sridhar Komandur, Any chance you could cut a patch against trunk?, BTW I'd recommend switching to Maven 2.0.5 or even 2.0.6 , added affected version, am gonna mark this issue as resolved until we get a patch which works on trunk. Let us know when you can make one and we can reopen]
