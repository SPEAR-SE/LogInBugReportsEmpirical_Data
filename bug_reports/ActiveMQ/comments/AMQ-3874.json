[Have you tested against 5.6.0 ?, No. We have not tested it with 5.6.0. But, have you fixed this in 5.6.0? Can you point to the JIRA ticket if so?, A thread dump of the broker will give an indication if there are any connections pending or pending close.

when the perl client goes away, it is the tcp client side socket that closes but it may not initiate the broker side close, that may need to timeout the read or even a pending write. I presume with lsof you are trying to eliminate that. Are u using it on the broker side?, Yes Gary, I verified on the broker side that no dangling hard connection was there., No thread dump of the broker or test case provided.  Recommend testing against the v5.6.0 release and reopen if still having this issue, ]
