[what version, or trunk?
Just ran it fine locally., Sorry, forgot to put that it was on trunk.  I checked out a clean copy to verify.  It also failed on the last Jenkins build.

, Fixed, its parent class was changed to not use a fixed port for the Broker and it wasn't updated to take that into account.  ]
