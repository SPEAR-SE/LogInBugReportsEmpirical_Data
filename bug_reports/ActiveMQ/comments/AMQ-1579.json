[Hi,

Do you have a small test case to demonstrate this problem? Is the problem still occurring in ActiveMQ 5.0?

Thanks., Sorry, this isn't particularly helpful, but:  No, I don't have an isolated test case to demonstrate the problem.  I haven't tested whether the problem exists in ActiveMQ 5.0., None of the Service classes were designed to be restartable.  It adds complexity to the codebase for a use case that is not that common.  It easier to just create a new TransportConnector.]
