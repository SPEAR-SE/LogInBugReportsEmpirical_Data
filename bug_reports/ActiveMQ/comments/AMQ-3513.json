[Pretty sure bad things will happen if the initalReconnectDelay is set to zero using this patch., Ah right... 0 == forever... ok... fixed it with a guard.  All works now., AMQ-3513-take2.patch is attached with the guard., Patch take 3... I moved the delay above the while loop, so it really is just an initial reconnect and not on every connection., Patch applied in trunk.]
