[This patch contains the fix that allows a user to use the SslContext instance to setup the https transport protocol.

The patch also includes a test that uses a broker configuration file and one that creates an embedded broker using the api's.
, Looks like the patch is missing the file: activemq-https.xml, Here is the missing configuration file that I missed.
, review and tested, patch applied, thanks!]
