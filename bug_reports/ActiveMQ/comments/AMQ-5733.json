[Also, after using kill we do not erase the PID file. This results in the newly installed package being unable to start as the file already exists., @James Green: i reviewed your problem and i agree

My intention was that a termination by "SIGKILL" should be something abnormal because the broker should shutdown in regular way.
SIGKILL does not provide the possibility to run shutdown logic (shutdown hook)  for activemq - you should really consider to shutdown activemq by jmx.

Nevertheless according to LSB (http://refspecs.linuxbase.org/LSB_3.1.0/LSB-Core-generic/LSB-Core-generic/iniscrptact.html) the exit code should be 0 if activemq is really not running after running "/etc/init.d/activemq stop". 
I changed this and appended it to merge request https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/61

, Briefly reading http://stackoverflow.com/questions/191215/how-to-stop-java-process-gracefully and https://major.io/2010/03/18/sigterm-vs-sigkill/ perhaps it should follow the follow the following strategy:

1. Attempt to send shutdown via JMX (a lot of people do not enable JMX or have it misconfigured)
2. Attempt to kill <PID> allowing a JVM shutdown hook to gracefully bring down the process
3. Terminate forcefully with kill -9 <PID>

In each case poll for the presence of the PID in the process list, and if it goes ensure the PID file is removed.
 , Attempting a shutdown by JMX and and SIGTERM (8) seems to be redundant for me. Both methods seem to do the same thing.
Probably it might be a option to do a fallback from JMX to SIGTERM if there is no configuration for JMX?
