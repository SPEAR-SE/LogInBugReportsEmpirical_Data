[There's another MBean where Dispatch is misspelled as Dispach., I could reproduce the problem again, but it does not always happen.

I'll try to create a unit test.

If someone else wants to take a look at it,
you can reproduce it by running my jmstransfer program:

http://www.v7f.eu/public/jms/

If you transfer a file of a few megabytes and interrupt the
durable receiver halfway then restarting it will often
block the receiver. Rebooting ActiveMQ
fixes this...

Scenario: Send the file:

jmsstream --topic topic/BigDurable --dest demo --timeout 0 /vmlinuz

Start the receiver and interrupt it:

jmsstream --topic topic/BigDurable --ident MyName --dest demo --prefix ./ --verbose
New dest: .//vmlinuz
Request: 1
Request: 2
Request: 3
CTRL-C typed here

When you restart the receiver it just hangs with 4 messages in the queue



, added an affected version, Fancy taking a stab at these Adrian? :), Hi James,

Just wondering, theres some typo in the openwire classes regarding the spelling of subscription, wondering if we can just change it. I've noticed that some of the classes deprecated the wrongly spelled method, should I use this approach also?]
