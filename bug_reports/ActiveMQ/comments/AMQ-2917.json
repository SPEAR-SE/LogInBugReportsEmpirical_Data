[Attached!, Hi Adrian,

I think this is a duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2881, which is already solved on the trunk. Can you test it out to see if it helps in your case?, Nicely spotted: it looks like a duplicate, and, I've tested out the
latest script off trunk and it works well. We can close this issue
out.
