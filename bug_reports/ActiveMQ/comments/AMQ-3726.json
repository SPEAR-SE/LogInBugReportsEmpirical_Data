[A redirection would make sense, b/c there were no code changes for 5.5.1, Hi Gary,

It just is a little confusing when you are looking for 5.5.1 API and you see you are redirected to 5.5.0.  Even though the API has not changed it would be good to have the title on the page updated so users know the are looking at valid API doc for 5.5.1., Javadoc now updated to 5.6.0]
