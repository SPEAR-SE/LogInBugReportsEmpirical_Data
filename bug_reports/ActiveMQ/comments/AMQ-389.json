[One problem with the fix, that I forgot to mention, is that the logic for checking the cycle is now replicated in the BrokerClientImpl::dispatch() method. This logic could be factored out to a common method if BrokerClientImpl::send() still needs to check this, or removed from BrokerClientImpl::send() altogether, if it doesn't need to check for this other than during a dispatch., This is now resolved in ActiveMQ 4.0 as we have a DemandBasedForwardingBridge which only forwards messages to another broker when there is a consumer for it]
