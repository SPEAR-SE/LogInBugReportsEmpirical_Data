[Hi Adrian,

this is expected behavior, as IBM JDK doesn't support connecting directly to the process. If you need to adapt your jmx url, change ACTIVEMQ_SUNJMX_CONTROL var in bin/activemq script, Problem is, I have multiple instances of ActiveMQ, running over the same activemq script! If I change the value of ACTIVEMQ_SUNJMX_CONTROL in the activemq script it'll work for one broker, but not for another. 

There's got to be a better way!, You can use --jmxurl to specify non-standard port when stopping the broker, like 

bin/activemq stop --jmxurl service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1199/jmxrmi

The other option is to create separate scripts and customize environment variables there

Take a look also at

bin/activemq create 

option that creates a separate broker instance automatically. If you choose this option note the bug fixed today (https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2975) regarding the location of the pid file., Thanks Dejan! 

Am already using the activemq create stuff, and had noticed some wobbles concerning ACTIVEMQ_BASE and ACTIVEMQ_HOME. 

I think that for now the approach using the jmxuri is the way to go.

Thanks again,
Ade]
