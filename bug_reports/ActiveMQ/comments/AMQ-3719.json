[test and patch for bug attached, This does appear to be an issue.  I don't think the patch is quite correct since it doesn't hop out of the redelivery attempt loop inside of oneway though which would cause the same tracked command to be attempted a second time which is shouldn't be since its already in the state tracker.  Perhaps the correct thing here is simply an else clause on the if (tracked == null) that calls the handleTransportFailure and then allows the method to return as usual.  , Fixed on trunk, thanks for doing the leg work on this one.]
