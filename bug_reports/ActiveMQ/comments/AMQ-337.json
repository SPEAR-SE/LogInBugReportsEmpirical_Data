[We'll be rearchitecting the dispatching policies in 4.x to make things like this much easier to fix, Is there an approximate expected release date for at least a beta of 4.0 which fixes this bug?  We are trying to ascertain whether we can use ActiveMQ now while we are developing and wait for the fix., This should now be fixed in 4.0. If you are still experiencing problems with 4.0-M2 could you submit a test case please?]
