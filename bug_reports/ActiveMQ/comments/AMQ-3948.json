[Messages can be redelivered if your client fails to ACK them.  Can you provide a unit test that shows your issue?  Since you are on an old release its a good idea to give the latest release a try as well to see if your issue has been addressed. , I have tried using ActiveMQ 5.6 and the same issue is seen there. This typically happens when multiple consumers attempt to retrieve a message at the same time. Our consumers spit out logs and the logged messages occur within the same second. If the timing is outside of that, this issue is not seen and messages are retrieved normally. If our client was failing to do something, I would expect this redelivery to occur all the time. The timing on this also makes it difficult to lock down in a unit test, though we can try. Would our logs or the activemq logs be helpful here?, You can attach any info you have, however without a unit test showing your use-case and the problem being seen it will be hard for anyone to go much further on this., Thanks Timothy. No need to go any further anyway. We couldn't reproduce the problem with a j-unit - activemq worked fine in that scenario. So we looked elsewhere for the issue and found it to be something internal to our application. We've fixed that - works fine now. Resolving., Problem found in our application, not ActiveMQ.]
