[why do you think this is related to activemq? I am not aware of any mandatory ant dependency in activemq, Yes is not a direct dependency of AMQ, but  I think that this should be added to official AMQ documentation (ant jars).
I added this ticket because the official AMQ rar deployer package doesn't work with JBoss 5.1., The JCA RAR has been improved a lot in 5.9 and test on JBoss AS etc.]
