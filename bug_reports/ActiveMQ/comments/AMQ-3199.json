[Added new test case for this cron entry in trunk, the next scheduled time was calculated correctly., I downloaded the latest 5.5 snapshot and repeated the issue. The issue still exists. I have attached two screen shots to show the problem.

s1.png shows the initial Cron Entry set to run Tuesday 3/8/2011 @ 12:11:35pm. s2.png shows the Cron Entry after the message was delivered. The next scheduled time is incorrectly set for 3/14/2011 @ 12:10:35pm which is Monday. It should be set for 3/15/2011 @ 12:10:35pm; i.e. Tuesday.

The activemq version I downloaded was apache-activemq-5.5-SNAPSHOT-bin-2011-03-06-03-55-16.zip., This file contains the output from the command "activemq-admin query" after the s2.png screen shot., Ok, now I see what you are running into.  Missed in the description that it was the second time around that was causing the issue, think the extra 60 second discussion confused me.  I can fix the problem with the day being wrong but having look more closely at the code I see where it can go wrong with other crontab entries.  , This should now be fixed in trunk, cron strings should now act like you'd expect.  If you find any issues please report the misbehaving cron strings., Fixed]
