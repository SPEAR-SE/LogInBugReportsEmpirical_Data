[rev: r452793
Added support for writing and reading of large strings in ActiveMQStreamMessage. Also, refactored ActiveMQStreamMessage to also use the MarshallingSupport utility.

NOTE: Refactoring the ActiveMQStreamMessage to use the MarshallingSupport utility will make it incompatible with previous versions as the wireformat has been changed. It is advisable to clear existing messages and use clients with the same version.]
