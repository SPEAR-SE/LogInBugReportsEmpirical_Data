PooledConnectioFactory added reconnection support but can break if the
holder of the connection adds their own ExceptionListener as the
PooledConnection doesn't protect the internal ExceptionListener from
replacement which leads to cases where the loaned Connection is not
automatically closed so that the next create returns the same failed
connection.  , Commit 48f314ef5a141639f519618a08e2b98fa29b03cf in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~tabish121]
