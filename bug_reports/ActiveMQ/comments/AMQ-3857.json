[Looking around I see that HornetQ has a REST api as well.  They return the JMS property values as headers.  This looks reasonable to me and shouldn't break any existing clients using this api.  I'll attach a proposed change to support this., Patch for including JMS properties into the response headers.  , junit test confirming header delivery of JMS properties.  , Using the response headers seems sensible.  Applied the patch and supplied test case, thanks!]
