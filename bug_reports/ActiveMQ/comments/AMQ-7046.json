[I don't see any attachments and furthermore we would need a lot more information then just "memory leak" to try and pinpoint the cause., Sorry, forgot the attachment. I know it's a vague bug, but I don't know what other information I can provide. Do you have performance tests you can run whilst checking the memory?, The problem is the broker is a complex piece of software with a ton of components and many different ways it can be used.  For example, are you using topics or queues? what about durables?  what protocol are you using? Openwire, stomp, etc? There's probably hundreds of configurations options that can be tuned.

The point is with what you have described there is no way to narrow down the source of the leak.  The simplest thing is to provide either a test case (ie junit or something) or provided a way to reproduce the issue., Something else you could do would be to analyze a heap dump of the broker when you think it is showing signs of a memory leak and use the tool to see what is in memory.]
