[Cameron,

Did you build from source or did you get a binary snapshot?, binary snapshot from http://dist.codehaus.org/activemq/jars/ 15-Feb-2005 12:08 , http://dist.codehaus.org/activemq/jars/activemq-2.1-SNAPSHOT.jar 15-Feb-2005 12:08, Cameron,

I just published a new snapshot.  Could you try it with the new snapshots?

Thanks,
Hiram, Fixed.]
