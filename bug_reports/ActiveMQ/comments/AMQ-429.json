[Well, I just ran test case against the latest ActiveMQ 4 source.

http://svn.activemq.org/branches/activemq-4-0/activemq/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/activemq/broker/store/LoadTester.java?rev=1023&view=markup

And It passed fine.  The above test case loads up a queue with large messages and then it reads them off again.
