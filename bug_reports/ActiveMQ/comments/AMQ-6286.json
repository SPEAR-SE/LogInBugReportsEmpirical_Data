https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6286 extend strictOrderDispatch to retain order of redispatched messages for a single consumer
, strictOrderDispatch=true - for a single consumer, re-dispatched messages will be inserted at the head of the dispatch list.
Note: this does not work if prioritizedMessages=true, in that case the ordering is determined by the current visible message priority, irrespective of previous dispatch order., Commit 604f707d4d69696fa18f2c58d3a46b0c282c37a8 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
