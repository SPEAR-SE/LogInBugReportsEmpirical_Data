[First, its best not to point to mailing list threads in JIRA issues, provide all the relevant information in the issue as the list messages can go missing etc.  

Second it is usually a good idea to try the latest broker release before reporting an issue as there are quite a few fixes in each release and you are running a rather old version it seems.

If you think there is an actual bug then we'd need a way to reproduce the issue otherwise we will have to close it out as incomplete given that we can't just guess what might be wrong.  If you need support the mailing lists are the place to ask questions, JIRA is for real bugs.  , Hi Tim , 

I agree with you and i am making sure that it should be reproducible and will be giving the steps as well. I am going to test with the latest version and update and eliminate the external mailing threads.

Thanks,
Akhil., I have figured out the fix in client code and it's not reproducible any more.]
