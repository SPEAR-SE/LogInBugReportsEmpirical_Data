[The first attachment is the Scheduler Class of kahadb. The second is the of activemq-core.

, It seems like a simple solution would be to remove the 'executePeriodically' function and just have the 'schedualPeriodically' called for all scheduled tasks as that uses fixed-delay execution instead of fixed-rate which is prone to stacking when tasks are delayed or in the reporters case the clock is changed.  , The changed are needed in the next activemq version. The both classes which I uploaded in this Jira Entry should be analyzes by a developer and then integrate it in the next activemq version., Fix applied in trunk, removed the call to scheduleAtFixedRate and replaced it with just a call to schedule instead.  ]
