[Can you create a JUnit test that shows the problem, and create a patch that resolves it?, Fixed on trunk.  , That was fast. I was preparing to create you a patch when I found that you've already fixed it. Thanks for it.

Anyway I have some notes that might be considered:
- exactly same problem is for class {{org.apache.activemq.pool.XaPooledConnectionFactory}} (it uses IntrospectionSupport as well in method populateProperties)
- my example might confuse you about property names - originally Gary Tully use "pool" prefix for the properties ({{org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory.POOL_PROPS_PREFIX}}), the prefix probably should remain,
- more on prefix: I would like "pool." (with dot at the end) more as it is used elsewhere (for example when parsing destination policies -> {{org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory.populateProperties(Properties)}})]
