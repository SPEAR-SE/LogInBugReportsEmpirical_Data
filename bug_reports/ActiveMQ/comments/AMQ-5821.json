    [AMQ-5821] Avoid probing of classes in Activator

----
, The patch is wrong.
The goal is not to verify that the bundle actually imports *some* known packages, but the fact that the bundle imports *our* package.
So the use of the wiring API is good, but we need to ensure that the provider is *our* bundle, or at least the same bundle which is used to load the classes., I updated the pull request to use wiring to check for the same imports we use., GitHub user cschneider opened a pull request:
