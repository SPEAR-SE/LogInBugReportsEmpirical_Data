[setting maxInactivityDuration=3 makes it (not surprisingly) VERY slow, however, the inactivitymonitor does trigger and even after restart of AMQ it connects and starts eating messages (though as you would guess, it constantly reconnects). 
If I set maxInactivityDuration=30, it acts the same way as with 30000, it never triggers, even after AMQ has been restartet and no messages are read., Turns out setting <prop key="prefetchPolicy.queuePrefetch">0</prop> in driverproperties for the spring context for the bitronix PoolingConnectionFactory fixed the problem., Not a problem in AMQ, but in default values and interaction between Spring DMLC and Bitronix PollingConnectionFactory]
