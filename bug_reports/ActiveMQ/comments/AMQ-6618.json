[Are you using persistent messages? This seems odd to me as persistent messages on a queue shouldn't just disappear off the queue unless they were consumed.  According to your scenario in step 3 and 4 the bridge was never reconnected (even though it was added) because the remote broker was offline so there shouldn't be a consumer to get the messages unless you had a local consumer.  You might want to turn on debug logging and take a look and see what the logs say.  The logs should give some indication of what happened to the messages (if they were consumed and acked, or sent to the DLQ, etc), Hi,

Oops, indeed did not select 'Persistent Delivery'.

Re-tested with proper messages, and the messages remain as they should.

This issue can be closed as operator error, mistake by operator.

My humblest greetings,
