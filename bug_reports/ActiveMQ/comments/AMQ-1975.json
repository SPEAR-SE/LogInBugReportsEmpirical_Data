[I've set queue name truncating after 50 chars. I have in plan more visual improvements for the console., Attached patch to set the queue name truncation length to 50, which matches the topics tab and is more reasonable than the new value of "8", Thanks for the patch ... I've already committed the same change, These fixes will now make 5.2.0 rc3]
