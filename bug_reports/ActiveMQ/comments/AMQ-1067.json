[To recreate the problem:
clearQueue.pl <TEST_QUEUE>
Ctrl^C

You'll then find that the consumer is still active according to the broker., This only affects version 4.1.0. 4.0.1 is fine., This issue is not yet resolved on 4.1.1, 4.1.1-SNAPSHOT, or 4.1.0. It can be reproduced very easily with the provided perl script. Ticket https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-724 describes the same problem but with a c client.

ActiveMQ-4.0.2 works fine, so the error was introduced in version 4.1.
, I think this is fixed ?, Version 4.0 is fine, 4.1 doesn't work, stomp consumer isn't removed.
, Fixed in the upcoming 4.1.2 and 5.0.0 releases. ]
