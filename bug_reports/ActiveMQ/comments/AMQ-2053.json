[Problem is that the AMQMessageStore is closed but not removed from the cache inside the PersistenceAdapter.  Next time a Queue (or Topic) is created it gets the stopped and unusable message store from the cache.

After chatting with Hiram on the dev list I think introducing methods to remove the message store from the persistence adapter is the best way forward.

Looking at svn history this problem was introduced in the fix for AMQ-1842, rev 729939, where the calls to stop the MessageStore were introduced., Fix for AMQ-1842 introduced this problem... message stores were closed (good) but not removed from persistence adapter cache (bad), New methods introduced in rev 732259.]
