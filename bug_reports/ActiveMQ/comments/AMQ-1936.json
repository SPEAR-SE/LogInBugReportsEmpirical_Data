[Can you re-attach ActiveMQDuplicateMessageTest.java and click the grant asf option ?, Hi Rob, Unit test re-attached with ASF grant. Thanks, Johnny, This looks resolved on trunk, Hi Rob,

I've downloaded the 5.3 snapshot and re-run the test against it and it still has a duplicate message failure.

Snapshot was : apache-activemq-5.3-20080922.231550-14-bin.zip

Would you expect the fix to be included in this snapshot?

Cheers,
Johnny, Did either of you manage to work around this problem?

We are experiencing exactly the same thing. We first started noticing exceptions due to duplicate messages being processed (100% sure duplicates weren't being written to the queue) - we then tried what was mentioned above about JConsole and saw the queue with a negative count.

Were either of you able to confirm whether the issue was particularly to do with having multiple concurrent consumers on the queue?

Rob, did the unit test work on your environment (was wondering if I should try it)?

Duncan, Added test case - see activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/bugs/AMQ1936Test.java - as SVN revision 777803.
Cannot reproduce this issue on the current trunk, This test hangs on some Linux machines (during CI). Needs some more investigation., renabled this test on trunk to see what hudson throws up, this does look resolved. The test case has been running happily for a few days now and on a bunch of hardware via fuse tc., Issue is definitely resolved.

I downloaded and ran the test on 5.2 and was able to replicate the problem. I then updated my jars from the latest 5.3 snapshot (20090908200340) and the test now runs successfully without error. Tested running it many times.

Thanks to all for your help on getting this resolved.

One question, does anyone know when 5.3 become an official release?

Thanks Duncan]
