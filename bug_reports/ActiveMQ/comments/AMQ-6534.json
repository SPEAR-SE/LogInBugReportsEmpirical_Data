[there is a related fix: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5274 but that was only applied to the jmx browse, a jms queue browser uses a different code path. , https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5274 may have the fix that needs to be applied in this case., Thank You [~gtully],

In case no one is working on it.. i would love to provide a fix., [~yogu13] it is not assigned to anyone so please do. Contributions are always most welcome, most especially fixes that include unit tests  ;-), Hello [~gtully],

Apologies didnt have much time for this.. I was looking into JIRA 5274 mentioned by you and also looked at the commit. This could be my lack in understanding of ActiveMQ codebase but i couldn't bridge the fix done with the one needed for this. ]
