[Also i just noticed that setAll() does not use "getMaxPrefetch()" to limit the new value.  dunno if this should be filed as a separate bug., Updated setAll to enforce maxPrefetch.  The input stream is now set using the all value, however you should be aware that the streams feature is deprecated and will be removed in a future release. ]
