[Unit Test to show issue, Can you try your test against a 5.7-SNAPSHOT broker?  I ran it here a few times and it passed every time., I have now tested against 5.7-SNAPSHOT and still have the same issue. It took a little more effort on the snapshot (For some reason the JMX interface only binds itself to localhost on 5.7 so I had to tunnel) but once I got it running the issue was still there.
I am attaching my activemq.xml file in here which is the only file I have done changes on from the default installation.

Here's what I get out of the Unit Test

_Sleeping 60 seconds to allow for expiration task to expire all messages_
_Queue size is 278_
_DLQ queue size is 22_, ActiveMQ configuration file for embedded broker, Added more information about java environment activemq is running on., Simplified the test case for use as a real AMQ unit test, problem does not appear when run on the support Java v1.6., Recommend you try this on Java 1.6 which is the supported version for AMQ 5.6.0.  I have not been able to reproduce this issue there. , Just tried it on both activeMQ 5.6.0 and 5.7-SNAPSHOT pointing activemq start script to JDK 1.6.0_33 and the issue is still occurring. Anything else that could be causing such an issue other than activeMQ itself that I can test?, This has not been reproducible here.  , Cannot reproduce this. ]
