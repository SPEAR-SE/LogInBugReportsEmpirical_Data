[Maybe this is the issue fix that broke the jms to jms bridge for stomp generated messages, the request-id field was added to support doing support the connect/connected stomp handshake with the broker.  It was not intended to be forwarded to any JMS entity.  Is it possible that your patch somehow forwards the stomp messages that contain the request-id property? (it would only be the connect message)., The patch i applied was in file org.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQTempDestination in the method setPhysicalName.

There was a number format exception raised as the string was not properly checked. Basically the patch is just some check against null and length of seqStr before parsing and catching of any NumberFormatException. 

I would think that this could not cause an unintended sending of a connect message. I am wondering if the request-id is  really only send for connect messages as i see it in any message going over the bridge even if i can validate that the message contains my own content. 

As i commented on AMQCPP-60 i patched 
 replace a line in copyStandardHeadersFromFrameToMessage from
msg.setJMSCorrelationID((String) headers.remove(Stomp.Headers.Send.CORRELATION_ID));
to
msg.setJMSCorrelationID((String) headers.remove(Stomp.Headers.Connect.REQUEST_ID));

in org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.FrameTranslator.java (inner class helper). 

From my understanding this class is relevant if messages have to be converted in and from the activemq format. 
, i tested this issue with a new version of the active-mq-cpp client from trunk after Nathan applied a fix to it. The issue can not be reproduced anymore.  , This was resolved by issue AMQCPP-60]
