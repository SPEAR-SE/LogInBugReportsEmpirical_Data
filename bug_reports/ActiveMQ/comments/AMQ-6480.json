[Have you tested on a current release?  5.7.0 is no longer supported.  , Hi Timothy,

I've tried with 5.14 but this client behaves differently. With 5.7 session.commit() throws and exception when the broker is unavailable. With 5.14 it does not and it waits until the broker is online.

org/apache/activemq/activemq-client/5.14.0/activemq-client-5.14.0-sources.jar!/org/apache/activemq/TransactionContext.java:280
this.connection.syncSendPacket(info, this.connection.isClosing() ? this.connection.getCloseTimeout() : 0);
conection.isClosing() si false and take the 0 timeout.

That is even worse for me since i need to release that thread even though the broker is not available.

Regards,
Sergiu, receiveNotWait working as expected on latest release, some fixes for similar issue in AMQ-3932 where it hung on prefetch zero cases]
