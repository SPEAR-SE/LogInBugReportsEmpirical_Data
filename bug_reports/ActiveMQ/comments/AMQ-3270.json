[At issue here is that the URI you are trying to parse is not a composite URI so parsing it results in issues because the parsing logic expects that you are supplying it a composite URI.  If you use the URISupport.isCompositeURI method it will return false indicating that this is not composite., Incorrect usage of the URISupport tools is at fault here.]
