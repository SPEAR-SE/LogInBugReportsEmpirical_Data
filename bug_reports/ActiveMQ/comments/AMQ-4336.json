[Can you attach some broker logs , I have set producer window size to Maximum(65535).And i come back to you after testing it., Broker Log, Modified Bulk Message Producer, After setting the producer window size to Max,it seems running yesterday night. but when i see it in the morning,consumer is not getting any msg from producer i.e.,producer stopped publishing.

Following is the producer log:-
2013-02-25 18:44:41,976: DEBUG – Broker Started
2013-02-25 18:44:41,992: DEBUG – Simulator started.
2013-02-25 18:44:42,429: DEBUG – Hello Request sent for SMS Casino ID: 194
2013-02-25 18:44:42,539: DEBUG – Hello Request sent for SMS Casino ID: 195

2013-02-25 18:44:45,195: DEBUG – StartUp Done Msg Received. Slot Count: 250
2013-02-26 06:20:10,070: DEBUG – Broker Interrupted
, At the time of testing, connectionInterruptedListener and connectionResumedListener were like below:-

        private void connectionInterruptedListener()
        {
            Logger.AddBebug("Broker Interrupted");
        }
        private void connectionResumedListener()
        {
            if (this.firstConnectionAttemptFailed)
            {
                this.OpenBrokerConnection();
                this.AddChannels(this.protocolSettings.channelBlocks);
            }
        }

Now i changed it like below and started testing again:-

        private void connectionInterruptedListener()
        {
            Logger.AddBebug("Broker Interrupted");
            this.firstConnectionAttemptFailed = true;
        }

        private void connectionResumedListener()
        {
            Logger.AddBebug("Broker Resumed");
            if (this.firstConnectionAttemptFailed)
            {
                this.OpenBrokerConnection();
                this.AddChannels(this.protocolSettings.channelBlocks);
                Logger.AddBebug("Broker Resumed and restarted");
            }
        }
, Two producers(10.2.44.73,10.2.44.80) each pushes 500msg/4sec to server (10.11.146.197)
The 2nd test done but with different error logs.
