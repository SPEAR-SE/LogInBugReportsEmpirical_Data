    AMQ-5859 Reconnection attempt logic seems wrong in JmsConnector#doInitializeConnection

----
, Added a fix based on the original patch that keeps the original idea of infinite retries if the max is set to -1 and also fixed an NPE case seen in the tests.  , Hi All,

I am investigating an issue where in if the Database goes down we get closed connection errors for transactions through AMQ.

The setup we have is as per below:

Websphere 8557
AMQ 5.10.2
Datastore (SIBUS) for message persistence - oracle database

Just would like to know, if this issue talks about the same problem we are facing?

Any advice will be highly appreciated.

Thanks!
