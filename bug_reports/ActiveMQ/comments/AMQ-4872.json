[wrapper.log seems to point at a memory exhaustion issue, queues.jsp is a wget of the queues page from the admin interface after the failure., Stoppng and starting activemq was not sufficient to bring things back. Stopping ActiveMQ, deleting the contents of the kahadb directory, and starting ActiveMQ did work., Please use the mailing list for getting help with these kind of operations issues/problems.
This JIRA tracker is not suitable place to discuss and get help about that.
