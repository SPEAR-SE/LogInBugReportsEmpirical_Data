[This patch takes care of the issue.  It's really messy because I had to add Javadocs all over to get Eclipse to compile the files.  ( My project settings require Javadocs, comments in empty blocks, no unnecessary else blocks, etc., but I was too tired to change them.)  Here's basically what I had to do:

* Extract interfaces for ActiveMQActivationSpec and ActiveMQResourceAdapter
* AMQRAImpl: Fix a couple AMQActivationSpec  equality checks
* AMQRAImpl: Use method calls on the AMQRA interface instead of field access in equals
* AMQMCF: Added instanceof check in setResourceAdapter
, Patch applied with thanks! I made a minor change to keep the implementation class names of the activation spec & resource adapter the same - to avoid breaking anyones RA/RAR configurations - so called the 2 interfaces MessageActivationSpec and MessageResourceAdapter (not the worlds best names, but I'd rather avoid breaking things)]
