[BTW to workaround this issue I tried adding a FileEditor to xbean-spring but that didn't help at all. 

It seems 2.0-rc1 or later requires URI syntax for files as strings. e.g. 'foo' -.> 'file:foo' etc.

So am thinking its better to just not use File types in the DefaultPersistenceAdapterFactory and use Strings by default. The downside is this would break folks using the Java API; but better that than break everyone who uses the activemq.xml configuration mechanism, We avoid using File objects on the default persistence adapter and use Strings instead. Its unfortunate (I tried patching xbean-spring to get around this but I'm afraid it doesn't seem possible). So folks using Java to configure the dataDirectory will need to change foo.setDataDirectory(file) to foo.setDataDirectoryFile(file)  or switch to using a String]
