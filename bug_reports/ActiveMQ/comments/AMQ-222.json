[There's a secondary bug that seems to occur with this, but may be a symptom. I'm using the tcp transport, and when the broker hangs with the OutOfMemory error, even if the clients are using the reliable: url prefix, I don't seem the disconnect and reconnect, they connect and stick. Without reading the code, it seems like a connect() is hung without a timeout., Some memory leaks have been fixed in the upcomming 3.0 release.  The leaks would occur every time a client disconnected.  I think this incident's OutOfMemory exceptions could have been caused by that leak., Resolving as being fixed in 3.0.  Please re-test and re-open if the memory leak continues.]
