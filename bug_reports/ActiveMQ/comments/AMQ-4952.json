[linking to https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4465 for more context

need to deal with duplicates to prevent eventuall delivery from https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4924, when the cursor detects a duplicate the message is removed and referred for DLQ processing with a reasonCause of "duplicate from store"
Thus it does not remain "stuck" till a restart. The typical use case where this can occur is with a duplicate forward from a network connector that fails  before getting a send reply happens after the original message has been dispatched. So the store does not trap the duplicate but the cursor does.

http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/f92d45be, dealt with the audit false case and duplicate in pagedInMessages - now redirecting to DLQ and removing from the store in that case also
http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/cc47ab6d

JDBC store does not have a separate index to trap the duplicate that is still inflight. Also, cursor audit window may be too small for some use cases.
If there is a valid usecase where duplicates are acceptable we can revisit but all tests currently pass with the change that 'outlaws' and deals with duplicates., further refinement in further refinement in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/27b3a7c3
