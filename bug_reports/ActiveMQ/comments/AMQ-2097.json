[sorry, thought this will fix it all, but now the conference room functionality is not working with spark. i will reopen the issue if i found out why
greets, with adium as xmpp client i was able to connect to the ActiveMQ.Agent via group chat (though there is a strange behaviour doing this a second time), Fix for missing dependency was commited to SVN revision 760045. I'll check these reconnection issues further., I tested the ActiveMQ XMPP support with a few clients and updated documentation accordingly

http://activemq.apache.org/xmpp.html

I think we can close this one now., wow,

nice update of the doc (especially collecting all the clients stuff). if i find any time, i will try to investigate why adium does have problems reconnecting to the groupchat.

greets,
