[a quick clarification....

you can't call ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.remove with a ScheduledFuture, because it expects a Runnable.

two alternatives are

1) don't call ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.remove at all... which is equivalent to the current behavior, tho this wil leave the executor with lots of cancelled tasks (see AMQ-1205)

2) cast ticket to RunnableScheduledFuture, and call remove on that. this will work because in this case ticket is a RunnableScheduledFuture, tho its probably worthwhile adding an instanceof check just to be sure., here's a patch., Good patch!  Thanks for figuring this out.  Applied., I made an amendment to the patch to check for instanceof Runnable rather than RunnableScheduledFuture which is a Java 6 specific class]
