[fixed. BTW the site is a wiki so you can fix it yourself :), I know not of this wiki thing you speak of... :-P

I figured you guys wanted to know about it... might want to check for new issues on the old system... may want to lock those projects if you have not done so already too., Is the right nav still generated from this page:

 http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ACTIVEMQ/Navigation

If so, looks like it still points to jira.activemq.org:

{noformat}
- [Issues|http://jira.activemq.org/jira/browse/AMQ]
- [Roadmap|http://jira.activemq.org/jira/browse/AMQ?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel]
- [Change log|http://jira.activemq.org/jira/browse/AMQ?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel]
{noformat}

Should be:

{noformat}
- [Issues|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ]
- [Roadmap|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:roadmap-panel]
- [Change log|https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ?report=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.system.project:changelog-panel]
{noformat}

I'd change it, but seems strange for a non-activemq folk to be changing this project detail on your site., See comments, the *right-side* navigation is still incorrect.]
