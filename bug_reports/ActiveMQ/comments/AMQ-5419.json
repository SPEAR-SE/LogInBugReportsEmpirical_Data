[Please add a junit test case to demonstrate you problem, and also a link to the documentation in question.  , So, i was trying to create a unit test that worked, so i could figure out which scenario worked and which didn't.  this was my first attempt at a "basic" setup, but it doesn't seem to work reliably.  occassionally it works, but usually it fails.  Any suggestions on how i might be setting this up incorrectly?]
