[I also reproduced this problem with ActiveMQ 5.2.0 RC3 (with the default config). , this may be as designed as there are still some persistent messages in the Queue.

There is a purge operation on the QueueMBean, if you purge the Queue before deleting it, the Queue should disappear. , I've tried to purge the queue with the purge operation in JConsole before deleting the queue. The queue still shows up after a broker restart. 

I've also tried to do the same procedure without step 4 (sending a message to the queue). In that case, the queue does not show up after the broker restart. 

BTW : Is there a way to delete queues other than JMX ?, this is a serious issue because if you have multiple consumer of a virtual topic and you try to remove the queue Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.topic and the broker did not really remove it and after restart, they are coming back. all those assumed removed queues will pile up message from the virtual topic. eventually the broker will stop function.
, if you are using the default persistenceAdapter, the AMQ-1998.patch will fix the removeQueue command issued from jconsole.

Beware that this command is per broker, which means that it will not propagate to other broker in a network of brokers or to the slave if there is one for this broker., Fixed by SVN revision 805873]
