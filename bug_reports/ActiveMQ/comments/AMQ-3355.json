[Working as designed '-' is not a valid identifier value according to the rules for JMS Identifiers in the spec., It may be unclear, but in order to use selectors from stomp client, you need use jms header keys, not the stomp ones.
For instance, if you want to get the messages with proper correlation id, you should use "JMSCorrelationID", not the "correlation-id".
Like this:
   $selector = ['selector' => "JMSCorrelationID = '$correlation_id'"];
   $stomp->subscribe($queue, $selector);, IMO it makes sense, provided hyphens are supported in header keys, to be able to select messages based on them. Otherwise the system should reject publishing messages with hyphens in the headers in the first place.]
