[The attached JUnit test demonstrates the described behaviour., This is by design.  The MessageProducer created in the pool case is anonymous and is used as the producer for all send requests so there is no associated destination for that producer which the broker and use to create an advisory. , Okay, I was not aware of this. Is this documented somewhere?, I added a note on this to the page: http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-jms-efficiently.html

, Working as designed, pooled anonymous producers can't fire an advisory.]
