[Lets tentavly target 4.1 for this feature., It isn't possible to reuse the "type" header (JMSType) for the purpose of sending through the information as to what type of message it is (text or bytes).  So this means that we need to add another activemq extension header.   I propose "amq-msg-type"., clients can use bytes and text messages so long as they follow AMQ's scheme for making the distinction: if content-length is specified, it's a bytes message, otherwise it's text.

So I don't think any action needs to be taken on this issue other than updating AMQ's stomp page to make it clear how to make the distinction between bytes and text using the stomp protocol., Since ActiveMQ already correctly identifies TextMessages and BytesMessages based on content-length, no action is necessary.

The documenation was updated on the wiki to make it clear how to create Text/Bytes messages from Stomp:  http://www.activemq.org/site/stomp.html]
