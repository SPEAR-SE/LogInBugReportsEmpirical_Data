[Add to "environment:"  java version "1.5.0_14" ( build 1.5.0_14-b03 )

The problem is in the jaxb-impl-2.0.3.jar  downloaded from the Maven repository, so strictly speaking, it's not an ActiveMQ issue.

But it causes the "activemq-rar-5.1.0.rar" deployment to fail, when the "jaxb-api-2.1.jar" is not available on the CLASSPATH in Java 1.5, so better keep the issue for easy reference., Problem with maven artifact at the time.  Nothing to be done here.]
