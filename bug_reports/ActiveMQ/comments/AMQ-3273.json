[Patch applied with svn revision 1089772. Thanks!, someone should add a warning to this page (http://activemq.apache.org/shared-file-system-master-slave.html) to let people know this is an issue in version 5.5.0 (since its the latest release)...

also, when will 5.6 be released?
, I encountered a similar problem but the problem happens upon startup. I would like to know if it is due to the same problem cause. I have logged an issue [AMQ-3432] Slave broker able to start together with Master broker (shared file system master/slave setup). Can anyone familiar with this issue enlighten me on whether the two issues (this issue and AMQ-3432) are the same?

Thank you very much.]
