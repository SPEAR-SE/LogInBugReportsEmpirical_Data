[I have observed exactly the same problem.  I also have both a test in code and with activemq installs that demonstrate a broker that is bridged to a M/S pair can forward messages through the network to a consumer just fine, but once the M/S pair goes into failover with the Slave being live, the producer attached to the forwarding broker hangs indefinitely when trying to open a session to produce a message.

This is the architecture in play

(producer) -> [forwarding broker] -> [Master/Slave pair] -> (consumer)

As I mentioned, I have modeled this problem both in code and using 3 activemq installations (one for each of the brokers), and in both cases, the forwarding broker (with a bridge connection) fails to push anything to the Slave broker

This has been tested on 5.6-SNAPSHOT (fetched just two days ago) and on 5.5.  Both suffer the same problem.
The forwarding broker has a networkConnector like so (for the 5.6 flavor):
<networkConnector name="bridge" uri="masterslave:(tcp://master:61616,tcp://slave:61616)" />]
