[This should be now fixed in SVN HEAD - could you confirm using tomorrows SNAPSHOT build that your issues is resolved now please?

Basically the code was catching IOExceptions and treating them as service exceptions (e.g. security erorrs etc) and trying to send an error response back, rather than just disposing the connection and so freeing up the clientID.

Let us know if this issue is not fixed and we can reopen this issue.]
