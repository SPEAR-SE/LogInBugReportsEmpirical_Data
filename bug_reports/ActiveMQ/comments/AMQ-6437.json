[I believe you've already asked about this on the mailing list and been given several explanations on how and why this happens.  The typical case is that you have old messages sitting around on a Queue such as in a DLQ that end up being spread across the journal logs which prevent clean up.  If this is normal operating conditions for you then looking into mKahaDB would be a good solution, all of which was brought up on the mailing list thread., Timothy:

Thank you for updating this ticket.  For some reason I did not get the responses, will follow up with our email team and see what the problem might be.  We did previously have messages on the DLQ but they were all moved.  When I posted there are no messages showing in the activemq console.  and as mentioned all systems have been restarted multiiple times.  I enabled the debug ports on activemq if i can look at anything to get to the bottom of it.

Thanks!
