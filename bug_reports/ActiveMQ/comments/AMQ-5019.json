[This was fixed on the trunk as part of AMQ-4930.  The current code looks like:

LOG.info("{}, Usage Manager memory limit reached {}. Producers will be throttled to the rate at which messages are removed from this destination to prevent flooding it. See http://activemq.apache.org/producer-flow-control.html for more info.",
                            getActiveMQDestination().getQualifiedName(), memoryUsage.getLimit());
