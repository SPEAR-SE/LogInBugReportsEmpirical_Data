[I am seeing the same thing.  I have a master-slave pair and almost as frequently as once a day I see a message like this in the master broker's log, then the master broker goes down, leaving the slave up.

2011-07-26 22:41:10,810 | ERROR | Slave Failed | org.apache.activemq.broker.ft.MasterBroker | ActiveMQ NIO Worker
org.apache.activemq.transport.InactivityIOException: Channel was inactive for too (>30000) long: /172.16.10.123:33644

I have tried setting timeout like this in the slave's activemq xml config, but the error above, referencing 30k milli timout still happens, as if this setting has no effect.

tcp://masterbroker:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=150000

I am attaching both the master and slave logs with DEBUG turned on.  I am actually running 5.5.0, not 5.2.0 as the original issue is written.  This is also running on CentOS 5.5, master broker full DEBUG log, slave broker full DEBUG log, Pure master/slave removed in upcoming v5.8.0]
