[The attached patch attempts to resolve this issue by removing the state associated with a destination when it is removed.  Note that this patch resolves the issue for the Kaha message store, but does not attempt to resolve it for other message store types.

Summary of changes:

* Changed BaseDestination.dispose() to call dispose() on the MessageStore.
* Added Index.delete() method.
* Factored out AbstractMessageStore to hold the destination and the default implementations of various methods.
* Added dispose() to the MessageStore interface with implementations for KahaReferenceStore and KahaTopicReferenceStore that delete the messageContainer and subscriberContainer.
* Added KahaReferenceStoreAdapter.removeReferenceStore() that drops references to a message store that is being deleted.
* Added MapContainer.delete() with implementations for all three container types., Fixed by SVN revision 729939, 729940, 729942]
