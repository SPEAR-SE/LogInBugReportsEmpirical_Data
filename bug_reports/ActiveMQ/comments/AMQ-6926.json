Â , there is a vm: create=false option that will cause the vm transport to fail rather than create an embedded broker with default config. That may be what you need.
http://activemq.apache.org/vm-transport-reference.html, Thank you very much for the hint. It is working now.

We have set server URL in standalone.xml to vm://localhost?create=false

The behavior with vm://localhost?create=true is incomprehensible. It would be better to leave the default configuration with create=false or to use the same broker-config.xml as it was used for the first initialization instead of using some default config on the second try.

Feel free to close the ticket.]
