[Did you try a 5.9 SNAPSHOT?  There are many AMQP fixes in there so testing on 5.8 at this point doesn't really tell us if its really an issue any more.  Provide a unit test if you want us to look at it.  , I just tried to build 5.9-SNAPSHOT, but the build is currently broken using a completely fresh repository:

It looks like the activemq-unit-tests project is build without a classifier, but the dependency above requires the classifier:

It seems the current build is relying on stale SNAPSHOT jars in order to build successfully.
, Commenting out the activemq-camel module allows the build to get far enough to build the activemq-amqp module, and this is enough to swap the jar in and test. From this I found that there was no difference in behaviour, NIO still spins at 100% as before.

Looking closer in the code, I am not seeing any kind of clear mechanism to switch from a read to a write, or a write to a read during the handshake, as required by the SSL protocol. I suspect this lack of support is causing the spin as an attempt is made to read when SSL wants us to write instead. I am going to have to get this code up onto a debugger first to see what it is doing in detail.
, Here's a unit test which should reproduce this.  (Note the test hangs using qpid 0.22, I haven't tried it with 0.24 yet)
, From a brief glance it looks as though the NIOSSL AMQP Transport is not complete, it appears to be passing a raw ByteBuffer onto the protocol converter before processing it into an AMQPHeader so an IllegalStateException is being thrown. , Submitted a patch to the AmqpNIOSSLTransport to get things working a bit better.  There's still no real tests there for this one so wouldn't count on this being a complete fix but it gets past the initial protocol discriminator phase and starts passing down proper Buffers to the protocol converter.  , This runs the JoramJmsTests with amqp+nio+ssl
, Test patch applied with thanks.  Tests are passing.  ]
