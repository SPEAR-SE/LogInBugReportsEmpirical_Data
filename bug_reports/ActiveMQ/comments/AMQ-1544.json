{quote}, Or maybe this is related to AMQ-1976?  We're seeing this issue using the latest 5.2.0, when you say the latest 5.2.0, do you mean a current 5.3-SNAPSHOT?, I just had the same failure with an activemq 5.2 as shown as logfile entries in the first comment here. 
we are using a stomp connector and after restarting a bunch of durable consumers, the message appears repeatingly in the logfile (seems to be just one message causing the problem).
after this, the whole message processing for all durable consumers stops and the pending queue size is increasing. any consumers of queues are not affected. 
is there a way to recovery the message processing from this state of the broker?

greets, I'm having the same problem with ActiveMQ 5.2. Only way I can "recover" from this error is to add deleteAllMessagesOnStartup="true" attribute to broker config and restart the broker. This will delete all my messages which is not that nice...

Are there any other solutions to this yet?, I have the same issue with ActiveMQ 5.2. 
If  I activate only a TopicSubscriber, I got the issue.
If I activate only the Producer, I don't get the issue.
The only way to recover I've found is to delete the store directory. Rather bully it isn't ?]
