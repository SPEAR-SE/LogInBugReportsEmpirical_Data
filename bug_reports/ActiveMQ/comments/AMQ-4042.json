[Please dont open a JIRA ticket with this. This is not an ActiveMQ issue. 

Its your usage of OSGi. OSGi is complex to master and get working. From the stack-trace it seems you need to have camel-core installed as bundle, to get the CamelContext class.

I am closing this ticket, as its *not* an ActiveMQ problem.]
