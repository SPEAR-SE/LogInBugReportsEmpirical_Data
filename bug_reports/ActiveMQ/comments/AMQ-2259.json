[Missconfiguration

Please use duplex, networkTTL and dynamicOnly
{code}
       <networkConnector name="default-nc" uri="multicast://default" duplex="true" networkTTL="100" dynamicOnly="true"/>
{code}, I have static entries in network connectors like uri="static:(tcp://localhost:41616)  for each other.
But i guess the issue is that a message will never traverse through a broker if it has already visited it once, Please correct me if am wrong . 

messages got forwarded from AMQ1 to AMQ2   in STEP1
And in STEP2 when the consumers are activated on AMQ1 then messages dint get forwarded from AMQ2 back to AMQ1 because it will result in cyclic forwarding.

If cyclic forwarding is the issue , is there a way to disable this behavior ,  We have brokers connected in network and the consumers on these brokers will be moving around the network during the release cycles.
