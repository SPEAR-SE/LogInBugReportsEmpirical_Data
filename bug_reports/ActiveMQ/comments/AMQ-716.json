[Bug in Description

Testing a Consumer with a transacted Session and commit
the Message is read and  removed !!, bug with  javax.jms.Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE in ActiveMQ ?

When I use createQueueSession(false, javax.jms.Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE)
the Messages are not removed from the Queue.


When I use createQueueSession(true, javax.jms.Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE) and
call getSession().commit() in the onMessage Method

the Messages are  removed from the Queue.
, optimizeAcknowledge now off by default, Note that a workaround is to disable optimizeAcknowledge - e.g.

tcp://localhost:61616?jms.optimizeAcknowledge=false]
