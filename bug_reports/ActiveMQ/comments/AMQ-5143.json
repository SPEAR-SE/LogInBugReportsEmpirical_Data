[btw, when activemq was working fine, I sometimes saw strange "Number Of Pending Messages", such as a small negative value or a fixed number (4000 as I remember)., Have you tested against 5.9.1 or a 5.10-SNAPSHOT ?, No, I switched back to kahaDB and 5.9.0 is working fine. Will seek time to test new version, No test case provided and not additional information provided to help debug this.  ]
