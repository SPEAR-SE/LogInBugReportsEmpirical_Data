[Patch applied - many thanks John! I had to make a minor patch to the MBeans to work with this patch (MBeanTest was failing) as we were being naughty and reusing the same consumerId on each createDurableSubscriber() MBean operation.

You're right that 1, 2, 4 are a concern too - any patches in those areas are most welcome :)

For 1) am thinking that the same IDs shoudl be used (so that then a broker is capable of deducing that a new connection is actually for an already existing client/subscription etc). We want to avoid tearing down and recreating a subscription if possible as for topics this could lead to message loss.

I do think we need some more logic in the broker that if it receives a duplicate client, it will first check to see if the old one is dead as it seems quite common to get duplicate clientID when the client things the socket is dead and reconnects before the broker notices that the client is dead. e.g. we should maybe wait until we try to ping the old client, if that times out, kill the old connection.

For 4) this seem to be a duplicate of AMQ-850 where we should timeout inactive consumers]
