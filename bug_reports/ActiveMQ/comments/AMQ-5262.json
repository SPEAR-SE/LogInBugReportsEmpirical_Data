[It does seems like there should be a close there, although probably after the connectionService is stopped to prevent any attempts at reconnect from contending with the close.  

In reality we recommend using Camel as the Bridging technology as it has proven itself to be far better at doing this sort of thing.  See: http://activemq.apache.org/jms-to-jms-bridge.html, Close connections when the connector is stopped. , The JMS Bridge so far has been working great.  The only issue we have seen is this hanging resource.  So, cleaning up the resources properly would fix the issue and make the use of Camel no longer a needed option.  Are there more technical reasons to not use the JMS Bridge the way it is set up in the Test project I included?  Is this functionality a legacy spec and no longer supported?  Did it change in 6.0? etc?
