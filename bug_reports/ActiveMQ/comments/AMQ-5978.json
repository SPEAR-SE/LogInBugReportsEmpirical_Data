[This has already been fixed for 5.13.0.  The method {{addScope}} was added in the Spring Framework in version 4.1.1.  The Spring dependency was just updated to 4.1.7.RELEASE in AMQ-5973, with this commit: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=ebf27cb

For 5.12.0 you will have to avoid using the activemq-all jar if you want to use a newer version of Spring and instead use the exact ActiveMQ jars that you need which don't include Spring., You guys rock! thank you!

I was able to avert the issue for 5.12.0 by including individual jars instead of the activemq-all. ]
