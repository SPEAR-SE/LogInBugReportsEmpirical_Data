[Since you didn't post your full configuration I'm going to take a guess that this is happening because you didn't set names for your brokers. You can set a broker name for each of your brokers as shown in the sample xml here: http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html

If you need more help you can email the [users|http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html] list.

If you think there is a bug somewhere then you can reopen the issue, preferably with a test case or some more information to track down the problem., had to reopen and close to edit my comment]
