[I have not yet updated the client library. Which jars do I need from the RC2 binary?

In these tests I've used the activemq-all-5.2.0.jar from RC1, I think. (2622429 bytes 2008-09-10 10:29), Found it :)

, 704142. slave was not affecting the inFlight count which is used to determine how many messages to pageIn. the result, only pageSize(200) unacked messages could exist in the slave without out of sync problems. having the slave modify inFlight as expected fixes this.
Additional test shows the problem and will protect the fix., These fixes will now make 5.2.0 rc3]
