[Patch to fix the issue., An example project that works after applying the patch., I'm seeing similar behaviour with the maven-activemq-plugin (version 5.6.0).  When I try and use the ${basedir} when setting <configUri>xbean:file:${basedir}/config/activemq.xml</configUri>, it spits out the following error "Failed to start ActiveMQ Broker: Illegal character in opaque part at index 16" when I run mvn activemq:run.   Seems to get upset with the backslashes in ${basedir} (eg. xbean:file:c:\dev\workspace\example/config/activemq.xml)  this isn't an issue in Linux, only Windows machines.

I can get around the issue by using a relative path, as Niels did, but also run into problems with Multimoduled projects.  To get around the issue I've had to use GMaven plugin to change the slashes in ${basedir} to forward slashes and feed the modified property into <configUri>, the workaround works, but it's ugly.  If a change could be made to the plugin to cater for the Windows backslashes that would resolve the issue. 

DOESN'T WORK.....
<configUri>xbean:file:${basedir}/config/activemq.xml</configUri>
<configUri>xbean:file:C:\workspace\activemqMavenIssue\example\config\activemq.xml</configUri>
<configUri>xbean:file:C:\\workspace\\activemqMavenIssue\\example\\config\\activemq.xml</configUri>

WORKS.....
<configUri>xbean:file:C:/workspace/activemqMavenIssue/example/config/activemq.xml</configUri>

, Looks like Tim fixed this in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4140

, So I tried with the latest snapshot on windows and verified that it works. See the pom.xml i attached for how to point to the latest snapshot.

If someone else can confirm, so we can close this ticket....]
