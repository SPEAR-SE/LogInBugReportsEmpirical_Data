[Producer flow control is the solution to this. see: http://activemq.apache.org/producer-flow-control.html

The idea is to avoid the hang by avoiding reaching the limit by asking the producer to slow down. , This a good point.

I have 2 Qs:

1. why the delete temporary topic is blocked ?
As far as I can see , it's an internal communication inside the broker which should release resources and therefore should not be blocked.
Does the flow control feature blocks an internal messages also?

2. what will happen if setting producerFlowControl="false" and what  is different from setting  <systemUsage sendFailIfNoSpace="true">.

In both scenarios the message sending will fail if memory space is full. won't it?
, This issue I believe is somehow connected to temporary topic and the advisory feature:
- I saw through active mq mbeans  that there are a lot of zombies temporary queue alive.
- when turning off advisory support the issue disappeared.

Yet, I can't turn off advisory support since I need brokers networks.

Yes.

With flow controll false, a send on the broker will block waiting for space to become availalbe, the client will experience a hang. All other users of the connection will also be locked out awaiting a response from the broker.

with sendFail..., if there is no space, the broker will respond with an exception that will be propagated back to the client so the client will see an exception rather than a hang., Producer flow control in action.  Working as designed.]
