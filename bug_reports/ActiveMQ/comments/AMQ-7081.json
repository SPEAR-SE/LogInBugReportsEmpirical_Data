[This looks ok, maxSlowDuration defaults to 30 seconds, if it is slow for that long it gets kicked with that config., see the attached test case, leave it running for 30 seconds and note the TRACE logging.

 

https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12944710/AMQ7081Test.java, Testing it out, hold on., Was fighting configuring the log level when running tests for a while but I got it running finally and the test passes.

Yes, it works as intended and I was wrong but I can't figure out how I could get it to work before. Oh well! We're looking forward to upgrading to the next release and be able alert on dead/hung slowConsumers now.

Thanks again! Have a great weekend!]
