[Bu suing VMQueue Cursor in destination policy for queues , Queue is getting De queued correctly , But I still see those exceptions in the logs.

 <policyEntry queue=">" memoryLimit="5mb">
                        <pendingQueuePolicy>
                             <vmQueueCursor />
                        </pendingQueuePolicy>
                     </policyEntry>
                    <policyEntry topic=">" memoryLimit="5mb">
, This should be fixed in 5.3 - but can we have a test case to confirm ?]
