[Do you have a test case already?  Some results from your analysis that points to an approximate location?  Anything that might help someone quickly track down what you saw?, My test case is : 
1. using leveldb and messages are set persistent  
2. loop send messages to topicA  and loop draw messages from qA1 and qA2 
2. with jmx remote enable, using jconsole to monitor the memory
3. the old gen keep increasing, each full gc cycles the only portion of memory free. The old gen stacks up.

Once I set the  concurrentSend="true" , and re-do the above, at each full gc cycles, almost all memory free.
, Need a test case that can be run under profiler to validate the issue.  ]
