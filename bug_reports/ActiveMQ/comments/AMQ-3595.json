[Would recommend you try your code using a 5.6 SNAPSHOT build as there's been so many fixes there since 5.5.0.  If you still see a problem then creating a junit test case to reproduce the issue is the next best step to take so we can have a means of reproducing the problem and investigating it., Is there a rough ETA for 5.6 being released?, 5.6 will be released when the last of the open issues against it are resolved.  Have you tested your code against a 5.6 SNAPSHOT ?, Bit difficult rolling out unreleased snapshots to production.

Will try to reproduce in dev., This should be fixed in the 5.6 SNAPSHOT.  No test cases provided to very the users use-case.]
