[watchTopicAdvisories=false is just for specific temp destination advisories so that a connection can know about temp dests without a round trip to the broker.

If you want to disable advisories, use the broker attribute advisorySupport=false
, True. But that will disable the advisories for the whole broker. In fact, what i want is to have only a single dedicated application that listens to the advisories for analysis., An ActiveMQConnection *only* listens to the temp advisory topic and only when watchTopicAdvisories=true

The Advisory Topics are created on demand when the AdvisoryBroker sends messages to those topics, but there needs to be explicit consumers.

You can disable most advisories via destination policy

Note all of the boolean advisory* attributes in

I am not sure there is any bug here?, Doesn't seem to be an issue here.  If you can produce a test case that shows a problem please reopen. ]
