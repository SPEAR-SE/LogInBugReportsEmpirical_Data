[Would recommend you try and create a small unit test that shows the problem, that way any fix will be maintained into the future.  , I ran into this writing a test for advisories

http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/69767a2f fixes it

The test for another issue I'm working on will be used to verify and guard the fix, Still seeing this in release 5.12.0.   Please advise., WARN  | Failed to fire delivered advisory, reason: java.lang.NullPointerException | org.apache.activemq.advisory.AdvisoryBroker

Still seeing the above in release 5.12.0 for every message fired.  Can't see the forest for the trees in the logs., Try the latest release (5.13.2) and write a test case that reproduces if you see it there.  , If you enable debug logging you will see the full stack trace which is helpful so we know the line it is getting the NPE on.  As Tim pointed out, the best thing to do would be to write a small test case against the latest relesae that we could run to help us figure out the scenario that is triggering the NPE.]
