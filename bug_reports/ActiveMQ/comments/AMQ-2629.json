[Non-persistent messages are stored in memory before they are sent to consumers. CursoryMemoryUsage indicates the memory(heap) used by non-persistent messages. This is usually capped at 70% of heap space. This is configuration is made in activemq.xml. When the cursory memory usage goes beyond the capped value( say 70% by default) the incoming messages are written to tempstore( a location on disk) and all the messages from memory are flushed to tempstore, here the CursorMemoryUsage becomes 0%. When you hit tempstore the dequeueing and enqueueing slows down because of disk writes. 

When queue size increases CursorMemoryUsage increases till a capped value and then becomes zero . After this enqueue and dequeue operations slow down due to disk writes involved., The supplied comment answers the question nicely, thanks.]
