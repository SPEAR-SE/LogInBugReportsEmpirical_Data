[Unfortunately I cannot attach a screenshot :(, This looks like it has been resolved on trunk with the fix for https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2706  can u verify with a 5.4-SNAPSHOT, It almost works... I can see subscriptions comming and going, but after a while, the old behavior is back.
Instead the following Exception appears periodically in the log of hostB:

, These two issues seen to be related., No test case to validate.  Suggest trying with the latest 5.6-SNAPSHOT to determine if this still exists.]
