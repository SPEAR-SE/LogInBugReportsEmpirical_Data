[Patch for bnd OSGI metadata generation in pom.xml, Thanks for spotting this, it fixed now with svn revision 1235685

We'll need to make a new minor release for these changes to take effect.

BTW. You only need activeio bundle deployed if you're using old amq persistence store. If you're using kahadb it's not needed.]
