[A couple of things.  First, 5.5.1 is really old and there have been many fixes with KahaDB since then so you need to try a more recent version.  I know there have been fixes related to garbage collection since then which may help.  Second, the behavior you describe of journal files sticking around because of a messages mixed in with acks is expected behavior.  The file can't be removed until all the messages are acked. You can reduce this occurrence by using multi kahaDB instead., Hi Christopher,

Thanks for your comments. Yes currently in our production old version 5.5.1 is deployed, in our next release of software we used 5.11, so we need to know whether the issue related to gc is fixed in that version. 
FYI, all the messages in the journal files are acked, even though checkpoint update could not remove it. In AciveMQ trace log it is pointing to a particular topic destination as the cause but all the registered subscriber consumed the message and acked.  After performing the workaround steps the files are gc'ed so we are suspecting index file corruption., Given this is reported against a very old broker release and there's no reproducer supplied to test on newer releases there isn't much that we can do here.  The KahaDB store will GC when possible but if older messages are left in the store this can lead to log files being left ineligible for GC.  ]
