[I can confirm that the issue exists on the latest version. The problem is very likely that the following code in Queue.java:

{code:java}
protected boolean assignMessageGroup(Subscription subscription, QueueMessageReference node) throws Exception {
~~~
                    if (groupOwner.equals(subscription.getConsumerInfo().getConsumerId())) {
                        // A group sequence < 1 is an end of group signal.
                        if (sequence < 0) {
                            messageGroupOwners.removeGroup(groupId);
                            subscription.getConsumerInfo().decrementAssignedGroupCount();
                        }
                    } else {
                        result = false;
                    }
{code}

... closes the assignment instantly so the next message will go to another group even if this message did not yet dispatched/ACK-ed. 
Closing should be done by the ACK on the message, not in case of assignment.
