[I'm sorry
I've ment "I have some transacted sessions", I've investigated the problem and I thnink the problem is absence of command like RollabckCommand which could increment redelivery counter on server.

It think it should be added something like RollbackCommand and session.sendRollback(rollbackCommand) as like as sesssion.sendAck(ack), working on trunk now. see resolution of linked issue]
