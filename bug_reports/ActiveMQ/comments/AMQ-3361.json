[Would be great if you could attach a JUnit test case to reproduce the issue, this will allow for quicker resolution and ensure the issue stays fixed into the future., I tried creating a test case for this, and the advisory messages all worked they way that I'd expect them to.  Reopen if you can provide a test case that shows a problem.]
