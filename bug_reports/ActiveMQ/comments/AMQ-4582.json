[AMQ-4428 adds logging of the error so your broker will indicate that a problem was detected in you configuration file.  , A patch with TcpTransportServer.configureServerSocket() updated to throw an Exception if IntrospectionSupport.setProperties returns false.  Previously this value was ignored.

Also included a simple unit test.

, Might need to dig in deeper here since this breaks many unit tests in activemq-unit-tests, @Kevin you might look at the patches attached to AMQ-4433 issue in conjunction with your work on this issue. , The patch for TcpTransportServer.java in AMQ-4433 looks good, however this time I'll run the whole test suite to be sure., Actually that patch ended up causing a few other test failures.  I'll take a look at them later today.
, Reporter of AMQ-4433 here. Yeah, I removed the changes to TcpTransportServer.java from my latest patch (see the comments of AMQ-4433) because of the test failures. IIRC, the problem is that other non-transport parameters enter that code path and mess things up. I gave up on validating the transport parameters because it seemed like too much work for me, sorry. I hope you know the codebase better and can sort things out!, I've patched the problem in the code for now by treating this option as a special case just to ensure we don't start up with all suites enabled as that's just not good.  We should still look to improve this so that bad options are detected and cause things to not start.  ]
