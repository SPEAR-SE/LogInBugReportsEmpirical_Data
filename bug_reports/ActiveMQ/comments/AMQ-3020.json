[Fixed with svn revision 1032647

The problem is that browsers are propagated through the network and with a full-mesh configuration and statically included destination, that could lead to duplicate message delivery attempts. Those attempts are rejected by the kahadb store (with "Duplicate message add attempt rejected.", and store and cursor goes out of the sync).

The solution is to suppress propagation of browser subscriptions over the network as they generally doesn't make much sense.]
