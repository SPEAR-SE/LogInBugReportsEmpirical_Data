[Please ask for support on the ActiveMQ Users mailing list. , I would just quickly point out that the error clearly says your store is 100% full which is an issue and second you are using a very old version and should upgrade.  But as Tim said you should post follow up questions about this to the users mailing list for help., Sure thanks for response]
