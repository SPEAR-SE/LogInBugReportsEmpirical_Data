[Patch which synchronizes org.apache.kahadb.util.LRUCache and org.apache.activemq.util.LRUCache on get(), put(), and remove() calls.
, Is there something I can do to further assist with this issue?

Testing with the attached patch was successful - all of the problems were aleviated.

I have considered writing a JUnit to test it, but that is not trivial because (a) the time needed to learn JUnit, (b) the impact of configuration on reproducing the problem in a timely manner (increasing JVM memory may delay detection of the issue), and (c) detecting the problem requires internal access to the LRUCache or some other method with which I am unfamiliar.
, Fixed with svn revision 1038566

I didn't make LRU cache synced in general, just synced the usage of pageCache. Let us know if it helps with your scenario., I will test with the update and post the results when complete.  With any luck, it'll be done today., 
Are you saying their solution isn't good enough?


, Oh hey Adam - different message thread.

I was just indicating that I need to run my tests to feel confident it's resolved.
, My tests just finished and ran without a problem.  In addition to consistent performance throughout the test, a heapdump with VisualVM shows the LRUCache objects all stayed within their limits.

Thank you!, Thanks for confirming!]
