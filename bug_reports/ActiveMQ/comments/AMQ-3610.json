[Can somebody please help me with this?, There has been a broker plugin available which does what you want.
Just add the plugin into plugins of broker like this:
    	<amq:plugins>
    		<amq:discardingDLQBrokerPlugin dropAll="true"/>
    	</amq:plugins>, @SuoNayi, thanks for the suggestion. 
Just out of curiosity, do you know why the configuration which I was using wasn't working?, With your configuration nonpersistent or expired messages will be discared while persistent messages will be saved.
The plugin will do what you want, it will discard all messages with dropAll being true.

, I tried taking a look at discardingDLQBrokerPlugin.java and found a couple of properties like dropTemporaryQueue and dropTemporaryTopic being set to 'true' by default. Since we use temp queues I would like to know what these properties actually mean and do. Unfortunately there wasn't much doc related to this. Would you know what they do?

Since I will be making this fix in our production broker, I would really like to make sure this plugin would not break anything else which is using temp queues and topics. Sincerely appreciate your help., Property dropTemporaryQueue being set to 'true' means the message should be discarded if the destination of the message is a temporary queue.Similarly Property dropTemporaryTopic means if the destination of the message is a temporary topic the message should be discarded.
Maybe you want to discard other messages such as persistents messages which reside in common queues or topics.
So for more handily,enabling dropAll will discard all DLQ messages.
AFAIK,it's safe to apply this plugin in your production broker and you can take off the old deadLetterStrategy as well.

, Thank you. I'll use this plugin as suggested.
