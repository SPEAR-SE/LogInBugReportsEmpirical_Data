[This is a major, major issue and I am very concerned that it appears to be up for fix on the 5.2.0 release.  As my company will not deploy the 5.x release of ActiveMQ for quite some time as it is nowhere near stable (or performant, it seems) as 4.1.x, I would like to recommend that a follow-up release to 4.1.1 (4.1.2?) be made as soon as possible.

Or, at the very least, provide us with a patch to fix this issue.

Thanks for your consideration.

P.S. The defect affects all versions of MySQL., This appears to be OBE.  ]
