[I suspect that this is resolved on trunk via https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2468 and https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2481

Can you validate with a 5.3.1-SNAPSHOT of 5.4-SNAPSHOT, Ah, yes indeed, this is fixed. Good news !

Strange it didn't strike me that I should try the latest snapshots before reporting ;)

Sorry for the noise.

Cheers,
Fabrice, This is already fixed.]
