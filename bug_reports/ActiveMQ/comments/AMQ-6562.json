[The WARN is expected when the cache is exhausted and page-in begins at the last ack location. Irrespective of the last cached message id in the cursor.
Any message that has not been acked will get replayed and the audit will trap it as a duplicate. However this scenario should not result in messaged going to the DLQ or any warn messages in the log.
In addition there is a leak of message references b/c the duplicates detected are not resolved by the TopicStorePrefetch cursor., Commit 511b9b642a198fe98409e1f1aac6176b9420d951 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6562] - suppress warn of durable sub duplicate from the store on cache exhaustion - expected in the absense of ordered sequenceid and setBatch. Fix leak of duplicates pending processing on batch fill for the durable sub case and remove eager page in for prefetch=0
