[This isn't actually a bug.  The Stomp 1.0 specification states that "Any client frame other than CONNECT may specify a receipt header with an arbitrary value. This will cause the server to acknowledge receipt of the frame with a RECEIPT frame which contains the value of this header as the value of the receipt-id header in the RECEIPT packet."  

As stated the receipt header only acknowledges to the client that the broker has received the frame, not that its acted upon it in any way.  You client will need to take into account the fact that messages are dispatched asynchronously and can and do sometimes arrive after you've sent the unsubscribe request., Working as designed.]
