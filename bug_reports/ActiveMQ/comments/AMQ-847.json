[Fixed in 4.0 branch rev 425922, I think  1) is a duplicate of AMQ-835 maybe?, your right.  the rest of the issue fixed in 4.1 branch rev 426134., There seems to be still some more leaks, try the following junit test with 4.0.2 RC4:

{code} 
  public void testCreateConnectionMemoryLeak() throws Exception {
    Connection c = null;
    // ACXMessagingFactory messagingFactory = this.getSessionContext().getFactoryContext().getMessagingFactory();
    ActiveMQConnectionFactory messagingFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("tcp://localhost:61616");
    boolean closed = false;

    for (int i = 0; i < 10000; i++) {
      try {
        c = messagingFactory.createConnection();
        closed = false;
        c.close();
        closed = true;

      } finally {
        if (!closed) {
          c.close();
        }
      }
    }
  }
{code} , I think this issue is actually *two* (or more:) memory leaks.
One in createConnection() and one in close().
I tried a very similar program with the following results:

apache-activemq-4.2-incubator-20061204.023752-14:
1. 'createConnection' followed by 'close' when activeMq-server is UP:
   outOfmemory after ~1800 createConnection-close.

2. 'createConnection' without close when activeMq server is not started.
  outOfmemory after < 1800 failed 'createConnection'.

I have also tried 4.0.x and 4.1.x. The leak memory too., keeping this issue resolved since I think reported problem is a different bug.  Opened up AMQ-1177]
