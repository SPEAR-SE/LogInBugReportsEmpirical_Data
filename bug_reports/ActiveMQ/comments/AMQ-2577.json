[This is actually exactly how CLIENT_ACKNOWLEDGE works.  

From the JMS Specification:

With this acknowledgment mode, the client acknowledges a consumed message by calling the message's acknowledge method. Acknowledging a consumed message acknowledges all messages that the session has consumed. 

ActiveMQ has a special acknowledge mode called INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE that can be used if you really want to ack only a single message at a time.

, Wow is that a misleading flaw in the JMS Spec, I guess I'll go write them about that.  Thanks for the info on INDIVIDUAL_ACKNOWLEDGE.  I just started using that and it works like a charm.

Thanks,
Brad, This behavior is defined in the JMS Specification.  I think this is really a flaw in the design of the specification.  ActiveMQ supports the spec properly, it's the spec that's misleading.]
