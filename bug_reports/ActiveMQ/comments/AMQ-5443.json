[Added an example workaround connection factory (MyActiveMQSslConnectionFactory.java)., Now that we require JDK v1.7 a simpler fix might be to use the HTTPS endpoint identification algorithm when configuring the SSLParameters.  

{code}
        if (isVerifyHost()) {
            SSLParameters sslParameters = engine.getSSLParameters();
            sslParameters.setEndpointIdentificationAlgorithm("HTTPS");
            engine.setSSLParameters(sslParameters);
        }
{code}

We'd be happy to review a patch along these lines, it should have unit tests along with it to validate things work as expected with checking enabled or disabled.  ]
