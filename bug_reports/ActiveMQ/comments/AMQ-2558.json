[does Oracle require a different lock implementation? or is the issue just with the output on the console. The default lock implementation is fine for most DB's, This is only for output on console. Rest seems to be fine:

INFO | Attempting to acquire the exclusive lock to become the Master broker
INFO | Becoming the master on dataSource: org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource@62af46

I was concerned because of the warning, That warn message is now at info level as it is expected when there is no override impl for a particular jdbc store.]
