[Added test to DurableSubscriptionRemoveOfflineTest with broker restart, inactive subscription was cleaned up as expected.  Perhaps you can look and modify to reflect your configuration and reproduce what you are seeing.  , Attached is the activemq.xml I use for manual testing. The unit test steps is the same as my manual testing. I will try to debug why the unit test fails to reproduce., Fixed unit test. Assert should be done in the return of Wait.waitFor(), Thanks for the fix, not sure what I was thinking there.  Will looking into the issue. , Fixed now, offline timestamp on restart wasn't getting reset. , Thanks for the quick fix! The Wait.waitFor() must also be asserted in the testRemove() test case.]
