[Also Getting the same error in 2nd instance also.

this is test setup. once it's worked then i am going to configure the Active Mq in live server.

Thanks,
Amal, I believe this was fixed already in AMQ-5251

Upgrading to a newer version should hopefully take care of the issue.  You can reopen it if running against the latest doesn't take care of the problem.]
