[see the test case MBeanTest.TODO_testRetryMessages() - if you remove the "TODO_" from the method name, the test case fails. Basically the retryMessage() method cannot find the message by message ID - despite the message ID coming from browsing the available messages in the DLQ, in the debugger, it appears like the DLQ is empty when attempting to retry a message (i.e. getMessage(String) doesn't have any messages available).

Am wondering if its related to the browse() of messages kinda removing them? Wonder if its related to AMQ-1914 in some way - that browsing somehow affects the status of the Queue?, Fixed by SVN revision 691114 and further enhancement by SVN revision 691214]
