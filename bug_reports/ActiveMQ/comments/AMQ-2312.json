[who should win here. I am guessing the component but the converter package is well named!, Gary is the code in the 2 100% identical?

Are there the same number of methods in the two classes? Maybe there are more converters. eg move all to the same class.

The converter is well named however the class is also named converter. Are there more classes in the .converter package then that wins.
If not consider moving to the other packages.

, This has been resolved since.

There is only 2 converter classes in activemq-camel, and they do not have duplicates.]
