[Patch to resolve Broker thread safety issue in MQTT, Patch applied with

http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/4ba4aa21

Although I still see testResendMessageId failing regularly

Failed tests:
  MQTTSSLTest>MQTTTest.testResendMessageId:717 null
  MQTTTest.testResendMessageId:720 null, Simplified version of testResendMessageId with a higher receive timeout, Thanks Dhiraj, I applied the patch and also improved testClientConnectionFailure() test which was failing intermittently. It looks good now.]
