[producer config, The scheduler store is based on KahaDB and will always keep one log file around regardless of whether there are scheduled messages or not.  , i know kahaDB will  keep one log,but i have a lots of files can not delete（xx-1.log,xx-2.log,xx-3.log...etc） and all messages has been dequeue。, This appears to be working as designed.  Submit a test case if you really think there is an issue here. ]
