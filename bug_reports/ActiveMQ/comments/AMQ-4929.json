, The patch only removes the method, but the issue calls for all the related bits surrounding this option to also be removed.  , Thank you. I'll rollback and send up a more complete patch. I just was wondering if I should also remove line 2332 in BrokerService.java (Link provided below). There is mention of  transactionbroker being disabled by default in the comment section and I'm not sure but I wanted to know if its safe to remove this line  BrokerService.java#L2332 ?
