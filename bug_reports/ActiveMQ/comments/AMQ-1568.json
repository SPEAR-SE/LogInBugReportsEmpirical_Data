[I would like to close this issue. 

I upgraded to 5.0.0 and had the same problems.

ttmdev helped me to resolve this problem. I had to add temporisation before freeing resources.

Thank you., It was a global problem of freeing resources too quickly. Such problem seems to happen more often, with embedded brokers than with distinct instance connected with tcp transport.]
