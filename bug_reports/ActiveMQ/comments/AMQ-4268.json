[I know that a few tests in that test case have variations for different persistence adapters and such, can you add clarifications for the failure on which variants are failing, for instance the testOfflineSubscriptionWithSelectorAfterRestart test was only failing for LevelDB the last time I checked. , You can't change the test method name because it breaks the CombinationTestSupport mechanism which calls the init method for each test that has a combination.  In the case of the testOfflineSubscriptionWithSelectorAfterRestart test there is an init method initCombosForTestOfflineSubscriptionWithSelectorAfterRestart which varies the persistence adapter for each run of the test, like a JUnit 4 parameterized test. , Yes, I just realized that after I saw your comment, so I deleted the patch.
 , Added the fix for the redelivery test case, its true that it would fail in the case where the for loop got a random zero and didn't trigger the redelivery flag to be set. , LevelDB problem is the cause of one failure here. , This looks like it's working properly now.  However, there was a typo in one of the initCombos methods that prevented a couple of tests from running.  I will attach a patch, and after that this can be closed.
, Update name of initCombosForTestOfflineSubscriptionAfterRestart so testOfflineSubscriptionAfterRestart is run for all three persistenceAdapaters.
, fix applied, thanks. ]
