[Again, I don't know if this is expected behaviour but it seems very counter-intuitive to me! (See also AMQ-2171), See also thread http://www.nabble.com/Forcing-queue-flush-through-to-consumers-browsers--to22621755.html, the current behavior of a browser is controlled by the maxBrowsePageSize PolicyEntry value. It defaults to 400. This limits the amount of messages that need to be in memory for the browser snapshot. Increasing this should allow more messages to be browsed., Working as designed.]
