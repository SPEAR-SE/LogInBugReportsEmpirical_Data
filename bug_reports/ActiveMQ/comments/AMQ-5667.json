[Have you tested this out on the latest release 5.11.1, Yes, I have tested in the latest version.
And I see the new code is also did not modify the bug, You should attempt to create a JUnit test case to reproduce this issue, There's not enough information here on broker configuration etc to create a unit test for this, please provide a test if this is still an issue.]
