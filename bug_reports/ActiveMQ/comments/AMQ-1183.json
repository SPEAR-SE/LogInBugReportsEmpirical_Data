[Workaround fix has been implemented in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&revision=511078 in the 4.1 branch.

Basically, if producer uses sync sends, he now can not block another producer on the shared connection.  To force all sends to be done sync, a new 'useSyncSend' option has been add to the ActiveMQConnectionFactory.

We should consider implementing a more robust soultion that will work even with async sends in 5.0.  This could be done by using producer flow control with acks similar to how we flow control consumers.  , The following revision was also part of the fix: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=511093, Is this an AMQCPP Issue? The comments seem to imply a patch to the broker., fixed.]
