[I think this is a jetty related issue. I just checked and jetty 6.1 reports the same on the startup of one of my applications (My App at http://0.0.0.0:8080/myApp).

Also from jettys pov this is not wrong, because it listens on all available interfaces (iirc the 0.0.0.0 on a bind implies this). But I agree it's not really a perfect information for the user., That's exactly correct, this behavior is not something handled by ActiveMQ, it comes directly from Jetty. And Jetty considers this correct because the connector that was started is listening on all network interfaces on those ports. , We should raise this issue against  Jetty so it can use the hostname/localhost instead of 0.0.0.0
