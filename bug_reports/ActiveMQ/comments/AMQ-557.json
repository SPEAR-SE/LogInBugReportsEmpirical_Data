[Probably these issues have same cause?, Little correction:

6. Now I wanted to test the durable mode and run the producer again **without** consuming the messages. So 10 mesages are left in the queue. , do you still get the same error when you disable statement caching?, With <property name="poolPreparedStatements" value="false"/> I stll get these SQLException on server side and IndexOutOfBoundsException for the consumer., Any ideas?, I suspect the IndexOutOfBounds exception was caused by either of these 2 issues we recently fixed in the wire protocol...

http://jira.activemq.org/jira/browse/AMQ-525
http://jira.activemq.org/jira/browse/AMQ-617

so I'm pretty confident the IndexOutOfBoundsException is now fixed in SVN HEAD.

, Jonas,

If you get a chance, could you check to see if this issue is still vaild against the latest ActiveMQ?

Thanks!, Was able to reproduce this issue on 4.0 M4  using oracle. Btw, it appears this issue only appears when using  oracle (not really sure why).  tried testing on mysql and mssql and didn't encounter the issue. 

Tested it on the latest snapshot and issue appears to be resolved already
