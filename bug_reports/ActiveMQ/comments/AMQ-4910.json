[Seems like this is caused by one of the new java arguments from commit 981c8e247f11871265a20a48e463096028188f36; I was able to work around this by putting double quotes around the path in the following line: 

{code}wrapper.java.additional.15=-Djava.security.auth.login.config=%ACTIVEMQ_CONF%/login.config{code}

, Update the wrapper.conf files with quotes around the new login config file definition. ]
