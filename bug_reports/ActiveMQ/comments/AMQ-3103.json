[Active MQ Log and Config files from our production servers., Hi Everybody,

Another observation. This one is funny.

We are observing that the Job Scheduler component *shuts down everyday precisely at 01:48 hours GMT.*
As mentioned earlier, the way we recover from these failures is by
* Stopping the broker using $> ./activemq stop
* Deleting the entire data directory
* Restarting the broker using $> ./activemq start

Are we missing doing something for the recovery?

I am re-attaching another log file named activemq-1.log. This one is from our staging servers where you would observe that the Job Scheduler shuts itself precisely at 01:48 hours.
, The broker shutdown yesterday *at the same time i.e 01:49 hours GMT on the 14th of January 2011*. The broker ran ok for about 20 days., Raising this to critical as this bug is causing *loss of messages*. The only way to recover from this error is to delete the data directory completely., Hello,
we got the same bug in our setup. The differenz is that there is no observable reason why the scheduler throws the exception and shut down.

Is somebody working on this issue?

Thanks
Laslo, We got similar problems. The scheduler stops from time to time due to an exception. Maybe, the cause is an unsynchronized method in the scheduler which results in a broken store structure. I described the issue in AMQ-3140. Testcase and patch is available :-) Would be interesting to see if the patch fix this issue., There have been several fixes to the scheduler in trunk, have you tested against a 5.5.0 SNAPSHOT to see if this has been resolved?, Hi Timothy

I will test against 5.5.0 Snapshot and post my observations., Hi,

I have not had this issue after upgrading to the Active MQ 5.5.0 Snapshot. Will upgrade all our production servers to Active Mq 5.5.0 in that case., User reports problems went away by upgrading to a 5.5.0 build.]
