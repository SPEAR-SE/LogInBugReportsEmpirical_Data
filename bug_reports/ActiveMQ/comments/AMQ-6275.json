[Were there any additional details in the logs that might help to know what was going on?  Not enough here to really go on. , A full thread dump would be useful as well (jstack -l <pid>) to show what all the threads are doing when messages are being blocked., I've also the same issue with the last release (5.13.3).
I've tried to change kahaDB configuration in _<persistenceAdaptater>_ block with adding attribute "_indexCacheSize_" with a value of 100000 to test if it changes something. Not at all...
I still have an error _failed: java.io.IOException: Blocking message pending 10000 for BLOCKING_

I will try a full thread dump to give you more informations if needed!, Sorry about the delay., Commit 98d20008333af380ae05d91036d123501115ab8c in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]
