[Have you tried JBoss AS 6.1.0? From the log it seems an issue with the deployer in JBossAS that cannot load Guava, also as you mention., You can also try to repackage the activemq-rar-5.6.0.rar file and remove the JAR files that causes problems. Some of the JARs is optional and only needed for special features., This is fixed in 5.7.0 as the RAR has been trimmed to not include leveldb and other stuff that isn't needed out of the box.]
