[After looking through the JMX console a bit, I found that most of the threads that build up and eventually crash the server look like this:

Name: JMX server connection timeout 7459
State: TIMED_WAITING on [I@6fd6306c
Total blocked: 0  Total waited: 4

Stack trace: 
java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)
com.sun.jmx.remote.internal.ServerCommunicatorAdmin$Timeout.run(ServerCommunicatorAdmin.java:150)
java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:637)


This appears to be similar to issue AMQ-1483 which was supposed to be fixed in ActiveMQ 5.1.0, I found out that this problem was caused by another piece of software not properly closing connections to the JMX server.]
