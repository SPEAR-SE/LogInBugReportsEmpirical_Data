[what do the broker logs say?, [~tabish121] No Exceptions found in the broker log., Attached the broker log files, 5.13 a bit out of date now, best to update to 5.14.1, Due to some un avoidable situations i can't upgrade now. Do you know how to fix this issue , Also out of  Curiosity asking can you explain me what's the difference between  5.13.1 and 5.14.1, Also can you Guide me on how effectively to implement SSL based queues and integrate with jboss, The target runtime for 5.13.x is Java 7, recommend you use that if you are having trouble or upgrade to latest.

Other questions should be directed to the users mailing list. , As Tim pointed out you are probably better off messaging the users mailing list but I will say that because you are having connection issues, one thing to check is your SSL config.  There have been various updates to the SSL defaults in certain updates of JDK 8 so that could be one potential problem.  Also, there have been some transport fixes between 5.13.1 and 5.14.1 so trying 5.14.1 is definitely worth a shot when you get a chance.]
