[http oneway sometimes is unable to send data because socket times out during client.execute() of post method. Currently, I have no idea why. Execution doesn't even reach the servlet. Could this be a jetty gremlin? Web server seems to be running ok, I think., Greg, could you check this isn't a Jetty 6 gremlin please?, BTW, I don't know if this is significant, but for most of the test cases that fails, the init method of the servlet doesn't get called., I'll look at this later today or tomorrow.   Last time I looked at this it was not working as the port to amq4 had not been completed.
So I'm assuming this has never worked since the amq4 port.... so lots could be wrong.

, The release was on beta6, which definitely had a few timeout type bugs. I've upgraded to beta10 and the send and receive test works fine for me.
The broker test is failing 6 tests, but none appear timeout related.  , Thanks for the heads up Greg. :), I was happy to continue looking into those 6 failures.....  probably later today.
So feel free to assign this back to me... unless your keen to look at them yourself

cheers
, Hi Greg,

Ok. :)

BTW, what was the reason for the failures? I did a run using the beta10 and got a JVM bind exception, but was able to fix it by adding a sleep every tearDown of the test case to ensure that the jetty server have enough time to shutdown first before starting the next run. The broker test seems to be passing on my environment. :)

Im currently looking at the send-receive test, it sometimes passes, sometimes don't. Your help would most definitely be appreciated., All http tests are passing for me now. :)]
