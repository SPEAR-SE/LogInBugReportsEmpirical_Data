[2.12.0 is available in maven central :

[http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.scala-lang/scala-library]

Its unclear if upgrading to this will pass all build tests., Scala is only used for LevelDB and that module has been deprecated and is no longer recommended for use so it won't be getting anymore updates., Thank You Christopher !]
