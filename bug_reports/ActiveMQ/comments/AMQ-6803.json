[the trafficClass is not a supported property - it is set via: diffServ attribute, sizePrefixDisabled is a boolean attribute that represents  prefixPacketSize., Ok, I was looking at http://activemq.apache.org/tcp-transport-reference.html
and homed onto trafficClass. If that is server only, ok.

, updated the doc for wireformat info for the sizePrefixDisabled

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/Configuring+Wire+Formats, The update slightly broke formatting on http://activemq.apache.org/configuring-wire-formats.html. The sizePrefixDisabled is in a wrong font.

More importantly, when I open that page, I get a popup

!popup.png!, i got rid of the popup - that page had old references and had not been rebuild in a long time., The font in the word is still slightly different, but not way too obviously distracting as before., lgtm, thanks for fixing]
