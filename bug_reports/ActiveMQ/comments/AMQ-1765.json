[Looks like a duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1264 which is fixed in 5.1, Hi Rob, 

i understand you are saying its resolved in the AMQ 5.1. but i cant use 5.1 because it has other major issues. for example i cant even use a selector while having Kaha as the persistence mechanism. My selector fails everytime. 

I am only using JMSCorrelationID in my selector nothing fancy. 

Thanks!, I am opening this bug again. , vik, could you please provide a small unit test or something that shows the problem?  Thanks!, Hi Vik,

please raise another jira for the selector problem]
