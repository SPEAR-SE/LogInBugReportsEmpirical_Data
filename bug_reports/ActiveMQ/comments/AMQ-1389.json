[This problem still exists in the 5.0 release candidate Hiram posted. I consider this a major blocker: under no circumstances acknowledged messages should be sent to a consumer again., I think I've traced the source of the problem: it only appears when I have this persistenceAdapter configuration:

<persistenceAdapter>
          <journaledJDBC journalLogFiles="5" dataDirectory="${activemq.base}/activemq-data"/>
</persistenceAdapter>
, Look like this was resolved when https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1095 was resolved.]
