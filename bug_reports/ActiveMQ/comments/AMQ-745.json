[Hi Jeff,

We have the following test case:
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/incubator/activemq/branches/activemq-4.0/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/selector/SelectorTest.java?revision=410119&view=markup&pathrev=413680

It tests our IN selectors.  Perhaps the problem is related to how the sector is being passed on the command line.  A JUnit test case showing the failure would help us fix this problem easier., Hi,

I tried to reproduce the issue, but the in selector seems to work using the browse command. Im using the default out-of-the-box configuration. 
My test scenario includes:

1. start the default broker
2. run the producer example
3. run "browse --amqurl tcp://localhost:61616 TEST.FOO
4. Get a sample message ID
5. run "browse --amqurl tcp://localhost:61616 --msgsel "JMSMessageID='ID:Javacoola-1841-1150366504906-0:0:1:1:8'" TEST.FOO
<one message is returned>
6. run "browse --amqurl tcp://localhost:61616 --msgsel "JMSMessageID IN ('ID:Javacoola-1841-1150366504906-0:0:1:1:8'") TEST.FOO
<one message is returned>
7. run "browse --amqurl tcp://localhost:61616 --msgsel "JMSMessageID in ('ID:Javacoola-1841-1150366504906-0:0:1:1:8'") TEST.FOO
<one message is returned>

Could you provide more details on your test method?

Maybe the message has been consumed/expired in between run?

Did you run the "browse --amqurl tcp://zuul:61616 --msgsel "JMSMessageID='ID:zuul-45732-1149587838616-3:24:1:1:1'" queue:inbound" command after using IN to check if the message was still there?

Thanks!

Regards,
Adrian Co, I've tried to reproduce this myself and I now think that there was something odd going on at the time. But it's not a problem with the selector.

If I get see the problem again I'll try and find out more about what's going on in the meantime I think this is a non issue.]
