[Test case that shows spooling and block issue when workaround of using  {code}policy.setExpireMessagesPeriod(0);{code} is omitted., resolved in r911650 and 5.3 branch r911759

solution is to have pendingmessagecursor next  do an auto increment on what it returns to make the caller responsible for decrementing or holding on to the references. This allows a browser to peek at a reference and release it at will.]
