[Test-setup with 3 applications.
ZIP file contains powerpoint summary, as well as STOMP on-wire tracing., Attached graphic summary., Recommend you try and create a Unit test based off what's already in the Stomp Unit tests to demonstrate the issue, then if something is fixed the test will protect the fix into the future. , [~tabish121]: JUnit test available in forked stompjms repo : https://github.com/jhberges/stompjms/blob/master/stompjms-activemq-test/src/test/java/org/fusesource/stomp/activemq/ActiveMQJmsStompTest.java#L94 , If its an issue with StompJMS then it should be tracked there, if its an ActiveMQ issue the test will need to be translated into a JUnit test that uses the style in activemq-stomp/src/test so that we can include it for future testing.  If you want to give that a shot we'd appreciate it otherwise it'll have to wait until someone has a chance to work on it.  Thanks. ]
