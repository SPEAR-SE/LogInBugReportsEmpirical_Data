[Duplicate of  https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1893, See "Selectors are not working properly"[1] and "Paging support"[2].  This bug also happens in my case. 
The max page size of the Queue limits the size of pagedInMessages. If this max page size is setted as 100, the consumer with a selector (e.g. "JMSCorrelationID=101") does not receive any message, because the pagedInMessages is already full of th the messages with the JMSCorrelationID from 1 to 100.

[2]http://www.nabble.com/Paging-support-td5979757.html, Please make sure this bug is fixed in ActiveMQ 5.2.
I hava read the code source and don't find any fix there.
pls check again., Duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1893]
