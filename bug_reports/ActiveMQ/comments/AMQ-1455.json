[The NPE is thrown on this line:

     Message message = md.getMessage().copy();

By following the code before this line, md can not be null, so this is getMessage() that is null.

Is this because I am erroneously using the VM transport? The reason I am using this transport is because my brokers are embedded in Java apps that connect to the local broker using the VM adapter., I have stopped using VM transport altogether from my embedded client application, but the problem still happens: the bridge keeps falling down.

I noticed the issue seems to happen if I have a queue browser (from Hermes) on the same distributed queue my application is using.

I recognize the issue is hard to reproduce on your side, but in the mean time can the bridge be made more resilient to runtime exceptions so it recovers and does not stop?

, Interestingly AMQ-805 gives the impression the bridge should auto-reconnect..., This same exact thing happens for me as well. I am also using embedded brokers with VM transport, This should be resolved in 5.3]
