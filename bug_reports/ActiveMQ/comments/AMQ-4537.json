[Can you try a 5.9-SNAPSHOT? There were some fixes around the perftest maven plugin especially around running the broker from the perf plugin...

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4466, That works. Is there any chance of it being fixed for the 5.8 branch? We're running into some performance issues in 5.8.0 I had hoped to troubleshoot using the perftest. I will start trying to do so using 5.9-SNAPSHOT, but since we'll likely be going to production with 5.8.0 it would be nice to verify against that version.

Thanks for the suggestion! Is this environment-related somehow, or was it missed in unit testing before the release of 5.8.0?, Probably just missed.. The plugin fixes most likely won't be back-ported.

Well.. when I use the perf plugin, I usually spin up a broker external from the plugin, and usually external from the machine where the perf tests are taking place. That might be a better option? That way you can test against any version of broker you want regardless of what perf plugin version you're using., Of course! That's what I'll end up doing too. Thanks for your help., Cool. No problem!]
