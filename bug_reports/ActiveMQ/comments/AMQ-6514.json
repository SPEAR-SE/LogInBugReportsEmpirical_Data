, it would be smashing to have an additional test in activemq-karaf-itest that validates and protects this sort of fix., I will take care of that. , Commit 037f28de5a1bc3068973fe3464e2217aa378bb93 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~chris@die-schneider.net]

[AMQ-6514] Upgrade xbean-blueprint to 4.2 to fix issue with placeholders
, Thanks for the PR, Many thanks for applying the PR .. can you also backport to at least 5.14.x? 
, That is a major upgrade of xbean from 3.x to 4.x - are you sure you have tested well on OSGi for this, eg build a local 5.14.x branch and test that - also manually in karaf, We tested this together with a customer that had the problem. We already shipped them a custom release with the changed features. , Commit 1fc93660c6da225b55e2fcf3dcd50a4e862617bd in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.14.x from [~chris@die-schneider.net]
