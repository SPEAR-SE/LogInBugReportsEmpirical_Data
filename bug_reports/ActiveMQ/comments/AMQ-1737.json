[Meanwhile I have found that the 'list --version' command works. 

The error occurs with the query commands  like 'query --objname Type=Connection,BrokerName=localhost'
, Problem also exisits using the web admin interface:

* start admin console
* navigate to Topic "ActiveMQ.Agent"
* send a message with content 'list' and 'Reply To'='MyReplyQueue'
* check ActiveMQ log file

so it seems not to be a STOMP related problem.

Can somebody confirm? Maybe it is just a simple configuration problem., 
It works if I enable JMX and instruct broker to create a connector:

<broker useJmx="true">

        <managementContext>
            <managementContext createConnector="true"/>
        </managementContext>

I suggest to add this information to the documentation of ActiveMQ.Agent topic usage

(Many thanks to Dejan Bosanac for the information)
, Documentation updated ... I think we can close this issue now]
