[This seems to be because of the malformed URL resulting from the below stanza in activemq.xml:

    <bean class="org.springframework.beans.factory.config.PropertyPlaceholderConfigurer">
		 <property name="locations">
			<value>file://${activemq.base}/conf/credentials.properties</value>
		 </property>      
    </bean>

If you add another slash after file: then the broker starts:

			<value>file:///${activemq.base}/conf/credentials.properties</value>
, Note that the same fix also needs to be applied to webapps\admin\WEB-INF\webconsole-embedded.xml, same problem and same fix in 5.3.SNAPSHOT, good catch: changes applied to r706164

thanks., These fixes will now make 5.2.0 rc3]
