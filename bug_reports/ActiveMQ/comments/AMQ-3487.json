[My last statement "This is a serious problem for us as we are needing to restart activeMQ on a daily basis to keep the production servers running." is now out of date.
We have had to resort to using queues for everything, and have noticed no memory leak after running solidly for 3 months! So queues work beautifully :-)
However, we have reached a point where we really need to use topics, hence the defect., can you validate that the problem exists with a current 5.6-SNAPSHOT. I recall, there was some work in this area., Hi Gary, thanks for the response.
Just tried with 5.6-SNAPSHOT broker and 5.6-SNAPSHOT resource adapter and still we have exactly the same problem :-(, Thomas, can you re-run the leak and generate two or more heap dumps from that run.   Where one is generated during the beginning of the run and one at the end of the run. 

Attaching those heap dumps to this issue might allow us to determine the leak culprit.
 , No information provided on how to reproduce or test case attached.  Suggest testing with a newer version of the broker, 5.6 SNAPSHOT has many fixes., I was unable to dedicate time to this defect due to work pressures. Now back on an activemq related task and have created the requested heap dumps on the very latest 5.6 activemq and resource adaptor snapshots., Attached are heapdumps from before and after we sent three hundred messages to a topic. Each message was within its own XATransaction, which was rolled back before the next message was sent. The memory on the queue increased 3% during that time.
Files are too large (45mb) for bugzilla. Is there an alternative location (e.g. ftp) where they can be sent?]
