, Added a small API change to this patch which solves a unit test problem in Camel., Pull request merged. Thanks

I triggered a new build of https://builds.apache.org/job/ActiveMQ-Java7/ which should definitely give us an answer if there are any regressions (local build was fine).

Can you close PR, as I merged your remote, so there's no commit that will close it automatically?, Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:

, Has someone tried this change under OSGi?
Using 5.12.0 fails for me in this area with the new commons-pool2.

http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/OSGi-ClassNotFoundException-when-trying-to-upgrade-from-5-11-1-to-5-12-0-td4701124.html

I believe it may be fixed in version 2.4.1: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/POOL-292, Yes... it has worked as well as the OSGi unit tests.  Can you open a new JIRA to update it to 2.4.1 and we can get to it., Hi Jeff, opened AMQ-5944]
