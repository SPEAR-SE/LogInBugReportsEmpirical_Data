[The serviceRead with the start lock held can only occur if it wins the race with the async serviceRead introduced via: AMQ-6414 - however it should never be servicing the error twice., Commit 6d4459a00c2441822297b06221bb107c5843c390 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from gtully
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=6d4459a ]
