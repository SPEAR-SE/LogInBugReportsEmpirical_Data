[I was not being very smart, I created a broker factory that would recreate the broker when/if it shut down. I had the broker bean scoped as a prototype, but forgot to have the transport connector also be scoped as prototype. so when a new broker was created it was using the old transport connector whos sockets where closed from the broker stoping.]
