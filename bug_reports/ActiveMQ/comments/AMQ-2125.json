[This exception is expected on failover if a transaction was in progress at the point of failover. 
The failover transport on the client side has a state tracker for commands and transactions that have been sent so that it can recreate its state on the failover broker. In the case of a transaction commit that is out standing, the message acks will be replayed as part of the commit, the transaction will be replayed but the messages will not be present (as dispatched messages to a consumer ) on the failover broker, they will still be in the store as the original tx will have rolledback when the connection was dropped. These messages will be subsequently be redelivered. The exception occurs when the message corresponding to the ack cannot be found as pending in the broker but it can be safely ignored.

Just to be sure this is what is occurring, is it possible to provide a log of both brokers with full logging enabled., In activemq 5.2 and probably 5.3 this message is logged at loglevel ERROR. It would perhaps make sense to reduce it to loglevel WARN? From Gary's description it appears to be harmless when using failover connections., log message at warn level in 5.4
