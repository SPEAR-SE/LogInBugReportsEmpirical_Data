[And perhaps this feature is enabled with a new flag.  say enableGcWithConsumersOrProducers... 

This way existing users aren't confused by any new behavior., As I mentioned on the USER mail list, it seems odd to want to remove a destination that has a consumer.  Consumers that sit idle on destinations the application knows will never be used sounds like a consumer leak to me.

Also note that the broker works better with fewer, more static destinations rather than destinations that are frequently created and removed.  There is a fair amount of overhead to destination creation and removal.

Please help me to understand the use-case better., {quote}For example, if you have a 60 second window, and you have no messages written, so you close your consumer, it's totally possible that 1 message comes in 1ms after you disconnect.

Look at message TTLs.  That's the best way to address timeouts.  If there's a need to ensure no message is ever missed (i.e. once it is produced, the application *must* get a response), then I highly recommend an architectural review., closed this bug after discussion on the list .. seems to not be a good idea]
