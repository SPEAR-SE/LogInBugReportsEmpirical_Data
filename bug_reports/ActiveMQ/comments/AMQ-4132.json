[Seems to be related to what cipher suite is chosen, you can reproduce it by setting the wrong one in the enabledCipherSuite option as well, the default case just shows it right away. , Fixed now on trunk.  The cipher suite in play can result in the packets containing the openwire commands to be broken up and the transport wasn't able to properly reassemble them.  Its now able to deal with this, tested several different ciphers and it seems to work fine with them all. ]
