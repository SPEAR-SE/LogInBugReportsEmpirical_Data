[Hi JB,

I don't think this is something we need fix in activemq side.
FYI, SMX4-910[1] already fix it on Servicemix side. We can do same thing for karaf as well(not sure we need do it by default as activemq isn't default feature installed by karaf), it just configuration thing for OSGi container which use activemq, simply add properties like
#
# Activemq Webconsole configuration
#
webconsole.type=properties
webconsole.jms.url=tcp://localhost:61616
webconsole.jmx.url=service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-${karaf.name}
webconsole.jmx.user=smx
webconsole.jmx.password=smx
in etc/system.properties
