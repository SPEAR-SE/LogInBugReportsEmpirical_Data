[JBoss AMQ is not ActiveMQ.  You seem to be confusing the products. AMQ is based on ActiveMQ but is not the same thing and a CVE reported against AMQ does not necessarily mean it is also valid for ActiveMQ.

Furthermore, please stop posting suspected security issues on a public forum (in this case Jira).  This is not the appropriate place.  Please follow these instructions for any future issues: https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html, Doesnt matter that AMQ is not ActiveMQ.  Jolokia is jalokia and is in both projects. Jalokia is the problem. Re-Open the issue, and fix the real issue. Jalokia is the issue.  Update the ActiveMQ pom.xml to point to the newer version of Jalokia that is fixed.   If no new/fixed version of jalokia exists, keep the ticket open., Oops I misread that this was about Jolokia and not the AMQ console, I can update the dependency tomorrow , Commit 2ebea251cdf58ddf0a29f41ccb6c6aadcfdb9b95 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]
