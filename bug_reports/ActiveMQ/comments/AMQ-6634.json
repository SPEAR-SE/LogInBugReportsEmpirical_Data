[5.7.0 is a very old release and I doubt you are going to get anyone willing to dig through JIRA for you to show you which issue might be at play.  Instead I'd recommend moving to the latest release which has numerous fixes.  , Targets a very old version and provides no test to run against newer release.  Better to ask on the users mailing list for help, and also move to a new release with latest fixes.  , I think this is same as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4148 . After moving to 5.9, the issue is not seen.]
