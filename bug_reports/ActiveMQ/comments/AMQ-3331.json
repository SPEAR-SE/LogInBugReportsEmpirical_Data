[Unit test that works with AMQ 5.5.0 to demonstrate how the network bridge is blocked.  The unit test passes when persistent messages are sent and fails with non-persistent messages., Patch that adds remoteDispatchType to NetworkBridgeConfiguration., Unit test that verifies the patch.  , Variant of patch applied with thanks in: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1186813&view=rev

Added boolean attribute, {{alwaysSyncSend}} to the network connector. This allows the behavior for persistent messages to be applied to non-persistent messages.
It does not make sense to have an 'always Async' mode as this could lead to lost persistent messages. As a result then need for the enum goes away.

Also, I agree with the assessment of the use of the responseRequired flag in the choice of sync/async send, 
it should be based on the persistence attribute of the message, I have fixed that.
This is vital such that messages sent in transactions are not sent async.

Thanks for the great test case, made life much easier., we should default alwaysSyncSend to true. otherwise we can run into connection blocking on resource limits when forwarding non persistent messages.
and we can have message loss. Best to be reliably forward all messages types by default., alwaysSyncSend=true the default in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1441545&view=rev]
