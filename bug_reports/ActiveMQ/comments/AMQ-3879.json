[note to self: A test case that uses two connections, creates a temp on one and a consumer. verify the advisory propagation via waiting for a failure to delete. then close the second, should get a failed send to the temp., Fix and test for this issue., 
Another note for reference:
The ActiveMQInitialContextFactory only create ActiveMQConnectionFactories (not pooled) and thus is affected by this.   This basically means that using JNDI to configure/setup ActiveMQ results in factories/connections that have problems working with the temporary queues.    No possible workaround without writing their own InitialContextFactory to handle pooled.   Not ideal.
, A workaround is to use watchTopicAdvisories=false on the connection factory.
?jms.watchTopicAdvisories=false on the brokerUrl will do that for you.
In this way, the temp will only be known to the connection that creates it.]
