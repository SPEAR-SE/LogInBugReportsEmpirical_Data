[Hiram, could you give a few extra details about this issue?

I'm experiencing a problem in 3.2.1 where I consume a message within a transaction and then rollback the transaction. ActiveMQ is correctly sending the message to the dead letter queue (maxRedelivery is set to 0). However, if I stop and restart ActiveMQ it restores the consumed message to its original queue - the original message remains in the dead letter queue!, Yes I belive that this has been fixed now.]
