[I've added a first cut at a configuration for your DB driver; so at least we'll recognise it now; it might take a few attempts to get things working properly. I wonder could you try SVN HEAD now - or wait for the new snapshot build tomorrow?

http://cvs.apache.org/repository/incubator-activemq/distributions/, With the new DB2JDBCAdapter    (Snapshot 19.04.2006) it works fine., Thanks for letting us know its working, In the RC3 Snapshot  I cant*t  find the DB2Adapter.  (incubator-activemq-4.0-RC3.zip    25.04.2006) ]
