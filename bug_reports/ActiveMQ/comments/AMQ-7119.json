[In the future support questions should be asked on the users mailing list.  The activemq-kahadb-store jar is the current library to use when running with the latest broker and you want KahaDB, What is users mailing list? Do you mean  we should directly send mail to - "jira@apache.org"?

Should we add both the jars activemq-kahadb-store-5.15.7.jar  and kahaDB-5.7.0.jar ?

 

Thanks

Thanks, You can find details of the users mailing list on the website at [http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html] (and if needed you could find that via [https://www.google.com/search?q=activemq+users+mailing+list]). Please don't open this JIRA again.

No, you should not add both jars, current releases don't use that old jar; as can very easily be seen through using or inspecting either the pom files or the zip/tar download.]
