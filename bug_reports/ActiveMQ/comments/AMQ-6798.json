[Dump of ActiveMQ Broker memory - this dump is after test cases but StoreUsage objects hold here too., ActiveMQ configuration file., Can you try a newer version of ActiveMQ to see if your issue still exists? Such as 5.14.5 or 5.15.0 ?, I suggest that org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue in method start() runs StoreUsage like this:
if (systemUsage.getStoreUsage() != null) {
       systemUsage.getStoreUsage().start();
}

But in method stop StoreUsage isn't stoped. So it remains in its parent StoreUsage.

Ok i'll try to test on 5.14.5 or 5.15.0., I think you might be right, the memoryUsage variable is stopped in the stop() method but the systemUsage variable is not stopped which I think would lead to this leak.  I'll take a look at this closer today., I've tested on ActiveMq 5.15.0. Story is the same. StoreUsage is hung in their parent. Memory grows after each queue instance creation., Commit 35bd3ad938f5c378b17a34980d2f3480bf3bbfc3 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

AMQ-6798 - Clean up store usage object on Queue stop

When queues are stopped the StoreUsage object needs to be stopped so it
will be removed from the parent StoreUsage.  This allows the object to
be garbage collected and prevents a memory leak.
