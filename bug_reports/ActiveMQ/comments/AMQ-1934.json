[Could someone please comment on this? It seems very serious because we can't rely on AcriveMQ failover., Tried with 5.2.0 and still experience the problem, We are on 5.3.1 and still seeing this issue!

When you have a single hot/cold pair its not a big thing, but we are implementing a network of brokers at Edmunds.com (essentially a stripe across several hot/cold pairs) and this will get VERY yucky as the only way we have gotten fail BACK to work is to shut down all brokers and delete KahaDB and backing store then restart.  Yuck!

We'd sure like something on this issue too!

Thanks,
Steve, Test case provided passes without issue using 5.6-SNAPSHOT]
