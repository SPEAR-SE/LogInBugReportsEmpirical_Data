[Note that the apparent inability to complete a connection happens because most
client libs attempt to subscribe to advisory messaging by default, so the connection
appears to hang.

But event if advisory message watching is disabled, the new connection (and any existing
connections) can't create new subscriptions or become new producers while the lock is
active.  So still bad., You can now control the number of destinations that are purged in a single GC sweep.  See AMQ-3339., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version, @Tim, I am thinking that this is a partial fix, if a recover operaton takes a long time, there will still be the lock out. The real fix is to change the way we do recovery. what do you think?, a real fix for this is not trivial, if we want to support a large backlog, then we need to deal with order and possible additions while dispatching batches of the backlog.
Dispatch should be async in any event.]
