[Fixed with http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/d60022ec, I made additional fix for this, introducing the configuration parameter to control this behaviour.

{code}<lease-database-locker handleStartException="true"/>{code}

By the default, we reverted to the old behaviour as some folks want the slave to keep trying. There's no way to differentiate misconfiguration and server shutdown based on exception, so one needs to decide how she wants to handle this.
