[Fixed.
- Also added better endpoint shutdown so that the sessions are properly closed.
- Better logging in the ServerSessionImpl so that we can tell which session is doing what.
- Added a maxSessions and a maxMessagesPerSession attribute to the Activation spec so that an EJB deployer can configure the max concurrency levels used by the resource adapter for a given enpoint.
