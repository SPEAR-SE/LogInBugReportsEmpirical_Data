[You need to close the ActiveMQ Connection instance when shutting down.  , The connection executor would be stopped if the connection close method were called. , The issue is not present when ActiveMQ is running .
Suppose I do not start AMQ and then start my webapp , failover protocol keeps retrying. 
Now, when I stop webapp , I have these 2 threads only .
Is it related to below issue ?
