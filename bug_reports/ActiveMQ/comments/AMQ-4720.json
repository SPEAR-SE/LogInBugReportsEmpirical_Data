[Configuration files & logs for the 3 brokers, I've tried using the masterslave: discovery agent (instead of "static:(failover:") but this agent doesn't seem to support fail-back to a priority connection., this is expected, network connectors cannot deal with failover reconnect and a connection to a priority backup is a reconnect.
masterslave: is designed to use failover: just to choose a url from the list so if the list is priority ordered you should get what you need. 
The issue will be falling back when the priority url comes alive again. That may need some tweaking of the failover url directly and may not be possible atm.
