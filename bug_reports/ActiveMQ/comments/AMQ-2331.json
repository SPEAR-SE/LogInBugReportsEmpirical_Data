[can you try this with a 5.3-SNAPSHOT and with conduitSubscriptions disabled. I recall a fix related to selectors and networks in the past few months., https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2104 may be related to this behavior, Gary,

The 5.3 snapshot worked.  When is the 5.3 release likely to happen ?  If this is going to take a while (more than 2-3) weeks, can you provide us with a patch that I can use ?

Regards,
Pradeep., I would hope to cut a first release candidate towards the end of next week but the process may take a little longer. There are still a bunch of issues that need to be resolved or deferred.

To see the relevant patch checkout the subversion commits attached to the issue: https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2104?page=com.atlassian.jira.plugin.ext.subversion%3Asubversion-commits-tabpanel]
