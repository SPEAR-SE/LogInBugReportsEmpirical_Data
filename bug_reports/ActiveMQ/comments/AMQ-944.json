[I patched this against the 4.0.1 version.  AMQ was ignoring any multicast URI other than the "multicast://default" one., This also appears to affect 4.1.0., patch applied with thanks!, Actually I just rolled back the patch as it was breaking some things; folks are used to using the URI like this...

{code}
mutlicast://group-name
{code}

if you want to override the discoveryURI then use

{code}
mutlicast://group-name?discoveryURI=someURI
{code}
