[config file & zabbix screenshot, 5.10.0 is a very old version and there have been many fixes since then.  I would recommend trying a newer version especially because https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5580 might have fixed this already., Old version with no reproducer to test on new releases.  Recommend an update to latest and then reopen if issue persists.]
