[fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1189700&view=rev

Added a warning when this occurs as it is an indication that duplicate suppression using the store producer audit is lacking. This sort of duplicate should be identified at source. the source is a failover reconnect with a pending send that happens after the original message is dispatched and after the cursor and producer audit windows are exceeded.
