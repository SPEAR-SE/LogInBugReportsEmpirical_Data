[Will deleting the db.data file help?, Actually this happened today again and there was plenty of space on the disk. Is there any way to recover the data? The only thing that I observed was that the db.data file was about 1.15 GB. Is that normal?, you need, kahadb options: checksumJournalFiles and checkForCorruptJournalFiles and ignoreMissingJournalfiles as it appears that your journal is corrupt rather than the index (db.data).

, Thanks Timothy. I am just wondering why these options are not set to true by default if it is so critical.]
