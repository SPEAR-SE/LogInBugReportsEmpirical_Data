Fixing file permissions in assembly tar.  Some permissions were not
being set explicitly which means the value used could change depending
on where the assembly was built. Permissions are now being set to fix
this.

(cherry picked from commit 43d493e527ccd7d940858646d37819d3bda0a806)
, Thanks for reporting this.  Some permissions were not being set so the permissions that were used depends on where the the build is run.  I have fixed the build to always set the correct permissions now for those files.
