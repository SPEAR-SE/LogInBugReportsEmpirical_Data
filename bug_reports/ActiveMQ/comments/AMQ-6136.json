Switching the version for Spring in features-core.xml to allow Spring
4.x versions.

, Unfortunately, it looks like this commit broke a couple of Karaf tests.  I believe the problem is that the Spring OSGi feature (spring dm) has an import defined with a version of less than Spring 4.  I think the only way to resolve this is to remove the dependency on Spring DM, which is now a dead project.  There is already a Jira for this here: AMQ-5932 and we should look at fixing this for a 5.14.0 release., Commit 7eb25ec50bd3af931c6ae876d9f7bef09385ba43 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]
