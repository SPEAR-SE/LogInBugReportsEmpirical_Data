[Fixed with http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/b53d8ea2, There's a new {{reconnectOnException}} property on the pooled connection factory (true by default). It will cause a new ExceptionListener to be registered on underlying connection and dispose the connection from the pool when problem is detected., Commit b65c0d1be4b0812229d3f166e50d963766856c53 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

PooledConnectioFactory added reconnection support but can break if the
holder of the connection adds their own ExceptionListener as the
PooledConnection doesn't protect the internal ExceptionListener from
replacement which leads to cases where the loaned Connection is not
automatically closed so that the next create returns the same failed
connection.  , Commit 48f314ef5a141639f519618a08e2b98fa29b03cf in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~tabish121]
