[AMQ-7076] Fix and update features to fully support Karaf 4.2.x
, Hmm, this seems to have broken use of ActiveMQ for Karaf 4.0.x?
{noformat}
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal org.apache.karaf.tooling:karaf-maven-plugin:4.0.10:features-add-to-repository (features-add-to-repository) on project my-project: Error populating repository: Can't resolve artifact org.apache.karaf.features:spring-legacy:xml:features:[4,5): Could not find artifact org.apache.karaf.features:spring-legacy:xml:features:[4,5) in m<-repo (http://repo.my.domain/repo){noformat}, Unfortunately, if this change works fine for Karaf 4.2.x, it introduced issues with Karaf 4.0.x and 4.1.x.

I'm updating ActiveMQ features XML to support any karaf version (even if the user would need to add other repo by hand)., GitHub user jbonofre opened a pull request:
