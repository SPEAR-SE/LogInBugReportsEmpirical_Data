[Patch applied, I was able to reproduce the hang, this is the stack trace
, These are both stuck on the same bit of code, shutdown while processing incoming requests. , Kevin, have you seen any failures from this test in awhile.  We updated the HttpClient to the latest patch release right before 5.8.0 and I'm wondering if this was fixed as part of that.  The stack trace shows the lock happens down in the HttpClient stack so its possible.  I've been running the test repeatedly this morning but so far can't reproduce. , I don't think I've seen it recently.  I'll try this afternoon and close this if I can't reproduce it.
, I can no longer reproduce thist.
