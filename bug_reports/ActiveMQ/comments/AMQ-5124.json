[Disable jolokia discovery as we need a new jolokia release so it can broadcast the correct hostname

We will revisit this in 5.11 and when a new jolokia release is out., Logged a ticket at jolokia
https://github.com/rhuss/jolokia/issues/135, With the release of v1.2.1 this could probably make it's way back into 5.10 if done soonish. , Yeah 1.2.1 is being synced to maven central, so should be there in a matter of hours/tomorrow, [~davsclaus] the original issue seems to be fully resolved in the latest jolokia release.  Can we go ahead and enable discovery in the default config and mark this as resolved?, I think we should turn this off by default as now. 

I dont think people want ActiveMQ to use unwanted network activities unless they turn them on explicit.
, Since its been off by default for some time now then I think we can mark this as resolved then. ]
