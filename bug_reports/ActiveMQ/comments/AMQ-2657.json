[My configuration file, Some screenshots from todays testing. There was one temp-queue without Consumer and Producer but with EnqueueCount counting. I had to do Purge on this queue from time to time - and memory was released. , Hi It's me again... I found I think which can be helpful... Today I had network problem with my one of my ISPs. So for about 20sec all clients connected via AMQ lost connection. After that time they had to reconnect although temp-queues kept "safe" in AMQ and now I have to purge them every  10-20 minutes to not get "memory exhausted" on temp-queue., Downgrading this to a major bug. I can't reproduce it - would like to know if its possible to add an expiration to the messages.
Also  - in 5.4 is the option to garbage collect unused destinations- which may help. 
Do you know the types of messages being enqueued ?, Hi Rob,

First of all I didn't get any notification regarding your comment so could react faster. But anyway... 
1. What's the option in 5.4 for garbage unused destinations ? 
2. Regarding messages types: well I'm not a programmer but we use AMQ for Order management System -> so we're sending "orders", "transactions" to and from exchanges. So rather text messages max 1k -> is there a way to "mirror" messages to so exactly what is being sent?
3. We have now simple script in jruby to "clean" "unconnected" temp-queues" so in 5.3.2 there is still this problem. I can test 5.4 if there is some relevant change to provide latest update if you need?
, Use of the Inactive Destination Garbage Collection feature will resolve issues like this., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
