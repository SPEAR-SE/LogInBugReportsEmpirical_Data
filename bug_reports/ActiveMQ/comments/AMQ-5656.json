new attribute on the managementContext, a comma separated list of attribute key=value pairs. Any mbean objectName that matches any pair will be not be registered in the mbean server.

For example, to disable mbean registration for all consumer and dynanamicPropducer view mbeans, use the following:
{code}
<managementContext>
            <managementContext suppressMBean="endpoint=dynamicProducer,endpoint=Consumer"/>
        </managementContext>{code}


To peek at the general naming scheme see: BrokerMBeanSupport
https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/61da1faa4c4e49191b373049ee36434aaad58897/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/jmx/BrokerMBeanSupport.java, I refactored this feature a bit, so that it supports patterns now. I also added some docs

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/JMX#JMX-SelectiveMBeanregistration, This change breaks the webconsole and is not complete.  When selectively allowing JMX entires, the ManagementContext still sends back a list onjects even though those MBeans are not allowed to register.  Hence the webconsole blows up with:

org.apache.jasper.JasperException: An exception occurred processing JSP page /topics.jsp at line 55

52: <c:forEach items="${requestContext.brokerQuery.topics}" var="row">
53: <tr>
54: <td><a href="<c:url value="send.jsp">
55:                         <c:param name="JMSDestination" value="${row.name}" />
56:                         <c:param name="JMSDestinationType" value="topic"/></c:url>"><form:tooltip text="${row.name}" length="50"/></a></td>
57: <td><c:out value="${row.consumerCount}" /></td>
58: <td><c:out value="${row.enqueueCount}" /></td>

The mbeans need to be filtered on request for their lists for what is being supressed through the ManagedRegionBroker, or the webconsole will need filtering code everywhere for MBean calls that have no ability to be called., Will close this issue and track it in AMQ-6175]
