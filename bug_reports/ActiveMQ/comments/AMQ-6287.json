Properly enclosing the indexLock in a try/finally inside of
AckCompactionRunner
, did this actually land in release 5.13.3? I see this in the release note https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311210&version=12335045
But 5.13.3 was released on 05/03 while this change was made on 05/11. How could this happen?, It was supposed to be 5.13.4 not 5.13.3]
