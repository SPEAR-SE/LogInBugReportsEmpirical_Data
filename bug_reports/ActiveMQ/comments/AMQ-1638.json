[Patch for AMQ-1638 : add correct [activemq-core-5.0.0.xsd|http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.0.0.xsd] URL in {{spring.schemas}} file.

Added line in {{spring.schemas}} file:
{noformat}
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.0.0.xsd = activemq.xsd
{noformat}, Our company has also stumbled upon this problem--it was rather time-consuming to root out.  It would nice if the patch could be applied to save others the headache., AMQ-1673 basically changes how name spaces need to be setup and declared in 5.1.0.  

Switch to the following xmlns configuration and it should work with 5.1.0

{code}
<beans
  xmlns="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans"
  xmlns:amq="http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core"
  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
  xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans/spring-beans-2.0.xsd
  http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core.xsd">
{code}, I would like to comment negatively on the decision to change the URLs for the schema files.

Using the no-version XSD files breaks many tools, including, but not limited to XML validation tools.
Using the with-version XSD files fixes the problems with any other tools, however since the URL is not mapped within the spring.schemas file it breaks application start up when no Internet connection is available.
There is also the compatibility issue. If the no-version URL is used it will break, or work, depending on whether the correct version of the JAR is in the class path, which leads to a number of obscure XML validation errors at runtime.

The simplest thing is to include the no-version AND the with-current-version URLs in the spring.schemas file.

Please reopen this issue., In activemq-all-5.4.1.jar the spring.schemas list is broken:

{code}
http\://activemq.org/config/1.0=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.org/config/1.0/1.0.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.0.0.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.1.0.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.2.0.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.3.0.xsd=activemq.xsd
http\://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-${pom.version}.xsd=activemq.xsd
{code}

The pom.version can't be interpreted by spring ..., Seems like resource filtering hasn't been configured (properly). http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-resources-plugin/examples/filter.html, All the schema versions is included in activemq-all in the 5.9 release.]
