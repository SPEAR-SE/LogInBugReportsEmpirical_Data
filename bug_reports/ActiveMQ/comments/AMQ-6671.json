[You need to test against the latest release 5.14.5 as this release is quite old and not supported any longer., I have tested against 5.14.5 and still the same issue. , Any plans to fix this as this is a major bug for anyone who is using JDBC (postgreSQL)., The best way (and probably fastest) to get it fixed is to do it yourself.  The code is open and you can dive in with a debugger and see what's going on for your case.  Most folks don't have access to a running PostgreSQL instance and aren't going to be able to investigate where you can, so dive in.  , [~anujkhandelwal90] it may be that the cleanup task needs to run a few times. messages for durable subs that are unreferenced are deleted periodically with the cleanupPeriod which defaults to 5mins. Then there is an iteration per each priority 1-10, messages with default priority 4 may take 20mins to clear by default

I didn't ran the broker for required time and keep stopping it in between, that's why those messages were not getting cleared, I retested it and ran it for long time, it was automatically cleaning up the data. 

Thanks again for your help Gary.]
