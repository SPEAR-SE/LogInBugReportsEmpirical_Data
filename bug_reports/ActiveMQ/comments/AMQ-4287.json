[would it be possible to modify one of the existing test cases to try and build a reproducible test case?
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-ra/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/ra/?pathrev=1440531, I will try to provide results of such a test., I have noticed that we had activemq-core-5.5.0.jar in the glassfish\lib. 
I am really sorry for bothering you with that - I opened this report too early., Non-standard installation.]
