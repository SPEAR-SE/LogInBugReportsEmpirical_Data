[The keepAlive() check is needed due to [AMQ-4705|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4705], otherwise you may get two master broker instances., It seems the broker simply deletes the lock file on the persistence adapter without any further checks. 
Perhaps a fix is to delete the lock file only if the broker still holds the lock and otherwise just shut down without deleting the file. , fix in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/8c66fba0, I just sent a fix that could be related to this:
https://github.com/apache/activemq/commit/ab8f54b0661755a3b5d8afbd18341e15ab4fe38c, I'm surprised that I haven't seen others with the same issue, but the unit test LockFileTest#testNoDeleteOnUnlockIfNotLocked always fails for me on Windows. It works on Linux. The problem is that Windows refuses to delete open files and the file is open, so lockFile.delete() returns false and does nothing, hence the no-longer-valid check fails as the file still exists and is valid.

Am I the only one seeing this, or should I fix the test (check the return code from delete and skip the rest of the test on failure)?, Commit 86c826c4615d5f4d90cc3f75fef845640369458d in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
