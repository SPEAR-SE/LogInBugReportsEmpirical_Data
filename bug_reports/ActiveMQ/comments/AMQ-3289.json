[updated the blob adapter in revision: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1095376&view=rev

Need someone with a handy Oracle install to validate the fix. Verify send received persistent messages > 4k

Kicked off a snapshot that will be done in an hour or so., It looks like the ojdbc6 drivers avoid this problem as they use the default adapter., Updates to make blob work with Oracle 10g., reopening to take in Williams patch, patch applied with thanks in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1173605&view=rev

@William, if you get a chance, can you validate tonight's 5.6-SNAPSHOT against Oracle.]
