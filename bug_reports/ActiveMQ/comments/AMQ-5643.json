[I'd guess it's a configuration problem.  You haven't included the config for the Jass credentials bits so can't look at that code is well used and tested so I would opt for config error over bug.  

Might want to post on the user forum to get more feedback on your configuration.  , well, I thought this also, but same configuration is running with REST service, Authorization is done by group not by user]
