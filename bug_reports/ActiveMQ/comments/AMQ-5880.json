Adds a test for the issue that is ignored for now while we wait for a
fixed MQTT client release., This is caused by a bug in the FuseSource MQTT client codecs used in the protocol converter.  I've committed a fix there for this but a new release is needed before this will be fixed broker side. , Commit 27799fec97b9ed7d685169593f7e6da06d52df0b in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]
