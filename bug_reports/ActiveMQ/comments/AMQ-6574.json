[Please find attached screenshot in eclipse debugger. LocalInitialContextFactory restarts the OpenEJBInstance., This seems more like a TomEE issue.  LocalInitialContextFactory is a TomEE class and it is what is responsible for restarting everything., This seems to be a TomEE issue and does not look related to broker code]
