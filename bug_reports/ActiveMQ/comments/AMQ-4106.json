[Ruby client example.
, Was able to reproduce some issue in a JUnit, will take a look., There's a couple issues in the NIO layer mainly relating to not keeping the TcpTransports receiverCounter moving which causes the InactivityMonitor to think that no reads are occurring when we are only getting STOMP keep alives which are just newlines.  The StompCodec also has a bug that's causing it to get stuck because of this. , Fixed now, also should fix a similar issue with AMQP and MQTT NIO transports. ]
