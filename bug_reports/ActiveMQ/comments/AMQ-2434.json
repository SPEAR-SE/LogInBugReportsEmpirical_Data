[the indirection via spring.schemas is correct: see: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/main/resources/META-INF/spring.schemas?view=markup

The indirection is resolved through the classpath and the activemq.xsd in the activemq-core jar can be found.

Within an ide the schema resolution for xml schema validation uses a different mechanism that is ide dependent. Typically the xml parser needs to be told that the core namespace resolves to the activemq.xsd from the jar. For eclipse this can be configured through the XMLCatalog mechanism.

Can you validate this with your IDE, I don't think there is any bug here., Yeah, I know that the indirection is correct. I thought that there was a problem with the documentation, since I copied the URL http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/activemq-core-5.2.0.xsd from some documentation, but it was from some site that provided spring examples. I can now see from the official documentation that the URL used in the spring configuration file is the same one used in spring.schemas. My mistake that I didn't refer to the official docs before issuing this.]
