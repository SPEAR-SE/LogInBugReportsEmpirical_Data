[Fixed with svn revision 1411632, think we need a way to make this change configurable based on the existing maxBrowsePageSize. It is now obsolete, but I think using a value of -1 to mean ignore the page limit and use all available memory could make sense. In other words, to remove the browsePageLimit use a value of -1 and when it is specified > 0 it is the hard limit.
This means that really large depths can be bounded in a browse. consider a queue with 1m messages and lots of broker memory... our browser will fall over. , maxBrowsePageSize > 0 will now limit a browser dispatch.

If there is no applicable policy entry the max == 0 and in that case the memory limit will apply.
the default maxBrowsePageSize from a matching policy entry is 2*maxPageSize so 400, to have browser dispatch limited only by destination memory - even if dispatch is non optimal - ensure no matching policy entry for the destination or explicitly provide one with maxBrowsePageSize=0, Commit b4e35fe8a355c0fd5fe8935ab583e2886121946b in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
