[See the statistics data enqueue count, dequeue count and dispatch queue size which are all 0.
, these were explicitly disabled as they caused to much of a contention overhead.

Is there real value in them?, Hi Gary, I originally raised this issue on the FUSE forum.

I don't mind if they're removed, but the counts on the 'connections' tab should also be removed, rather than showing 0.  Right now since the enqueue/dequeue counts on the topics and queues views do show the right data, I had an assumption that these might too., would be good to get these removed from the jmx and webconsole for 5.3 as they are now obsolete. re scheduling for 5.3, Fixed in SVN revision 805396]
