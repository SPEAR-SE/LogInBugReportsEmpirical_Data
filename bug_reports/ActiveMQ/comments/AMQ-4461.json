[Fixed with svn revision 1465683, Note that you should use backupPoolSize to match number of brokers - 1 for this to work. For 3 brokers, an example can be

{code}failover:(tcp://localhost:61616,tcp://localhost:62616,tcp://localhost:63616)?randomize=false&priorityBackup=true&backupPoolSize=2{code}

, Svn revision 1486869 added an additional improvement where priority backup will not be restricted by the backup pool size. If priority backup is available, the client will reconnect to it.]
