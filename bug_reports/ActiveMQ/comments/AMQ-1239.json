[Scheduler.java does not contain import RunnableScheduledFuture
How is this possible to commit code that does not compile?
do you use continuous integration in AMQ for all major branches?. 
I see it is open source but there are many open source projects with a good quality., please add
import edu.emory.mathcs.backport.java.util.concurrent.RunnableScheduledFuture;
to the Scheduled.java, 

and please use continuous integration for major branches, having maven scripts it should be very easy, the Java 6 code is now removed from trunk and 4.1 branches]
