[I see the servlet declaration in web.xml of activemq-web-console was removed month ago. I'm attaching the patch which reverts this change.

[~dejanb] Can you please look why the declaration was removed?

Thank you,
Robert, Let me take a look, Thanks for reporting, and Robert for the patch. Its working again now.]
