[Attached in amq-1098potentialpatch.zip are a few fixed files that appear to address the classcastexception...basically made an httpsclienttransport which just extends the existing HttpClientTransport.  Because the underlying HttpClient works with http and https, there are no further changes needed.  Then in the HttpsTransportFactory I return the newly created httpsclienttransport...since it extends the httpclienttransport there is no longer the classcastexception.  Tested and seems to work for my purposes, patch against v4.1.1., patch applied in rev 651320.. Thanks!, HttpsTransportFactory does not override doBind(URI location); therefore, HttpTransportFactory's doBind(URI location) is referenced instead. So a 'https://' transportConnector ends up using a HttpTransportServer instead of HttpsTransportServer object. , Original patch resolves issue for 4.1.1, additionally applying Joe's patch seems to resolve issues in 5.1.0, patch applied to trunk, r728687 thanks.]
