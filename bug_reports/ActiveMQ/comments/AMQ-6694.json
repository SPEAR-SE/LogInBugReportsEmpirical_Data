[[~davsclaus] - Is it ok if we switch the flag isAllowAutoWiredConnectionFactory to return true inside org.apache.activemq.camel.component.ActiveMQComponent now that we have upgraded to Camel 2.19? The comment you added says it requires 2.18 so I assume it's ok to return true now., Yeah I think we should look into doing this, as IMHO camel on Spring Boot should be able to just use the configuration in application.properties.

For example this example in my book used to work
https://github.com/camelinaction/camelinaction2/blob/master/chapter7/prototype2/rules2-springboot/src/main/java/camelinaction/InventoryRoute.java#L23

But had to add this workaround., Commit ae66f964ec7d03e282d42fda3be8b59bedcfa773 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~davsclaus]
