, I created a pull request based on the patch submitted to this ticket to fix the resource leaks. (ie not closing streams).  The other fixes I still need to look at more., I forgot to add that the double locking race condition issue was actually already fixed in AMQ-5787 , Github user asfgit closed the pull request at:

    https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/118
, Applied PR containing a subset of the changes identified in the patch, others appear to be non-issues or already resolved.  I'd recommend testing the code from master with your tooling to see if any other issues show up that seems like real problems.  New issues can be opened with targeted patches for different areas of concern.  , Commit 42d9fd118daea5cc10f7eb56c263063adb322f25 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.11.x from [~cshannon]
