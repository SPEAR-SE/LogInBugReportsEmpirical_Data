[So the NPE is not great here but what you are trying to do is also not really expected to work.  Temporary destinations are created from an open connection using createTempQueue or createTempTopic and then used by that connection (and only that connection) to consume from, other connections can produce to it if the destination is set as a reply to on a message.  Defining the temporary destination in your JNDI config make the assumption that the broker will just happily create one for you if it does not exist which is not really true over AMQP as there are properties of the incoming link creation that control if a temporary topic is created.  The fix that would really make sense here is better detect this sort of thing and close the link with an error.  , Updated the AMQP handling code to reject links that are created using named temp destinations that didn't originate from a dynamic link.  ]
