[[~cshannon] Hi Chris, I have fixed this in my local code. Here is the what needs to be changed. I also enhanced the unit tests in NetworkConnectorTest.java. 

The following change needs to happen in org.apache.activemq.plugin.NetworkConnectorProcessor.java file

  @Override
    public void addNew(Object o) {
        DtoNetworkConnector networkConnector = (DtoNetworkConnector) o;
        if (networkConnector.getUri() != null) {
            try {
                DiscoveryNetworkConnector nc = fromDto(networkConnector, new DiscoveryNetworkConnector());
                plugin.getBrokerService().addNetworkConnector(nc);
               if (plugin.getBrokerService().isUseJmx()) {
                	plugin.getBrokerService().registerNetworkConnectorMBean(nc);
                	
                } 
                nc.start();
                plugin.info("started new network connector: " + nc);
                
            } catch (Exception e) {
                plugin.info("Failed to add new networkConnector " + networkConnector, e);
            }
        }
    }, [~thodimi], thanks for the heads up.  There's also a change needed for the JavaRuntimePlugin as well.  I will create a patch and test and merge it in for 5.14.4, This is actually a more complex patch because after looking at this there are a couple other things not being set quite right on the network connector when added/updated through the runtime plugin instead of on broker start.  Working on a patch and test now., Commit bab0887ed60907d4ccac1824d83371a592f94925 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

AMQ-6610 - Network connector mbean not registered on reload

On network connector add or update after broker start (such as the
runtime plugins) the mbean was not created.  There was also a couple of
other properties not set. Fixed the network connector start to be the
same for normal broker start and runtime reload.

, Turns out there were a couple of other properties like brokerName, brokerUrl, and durableDestinations which were not populated either.  Fixed those and the re-add of the mbean., Commit ef84db5e64b7a96a0c5c7271bd88642d940ba7a4 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]
