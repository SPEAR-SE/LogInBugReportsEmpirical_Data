[Root cause is due to the SASL handshake and the proton transport not being able to re-init afterwards to the client's requested max frame size.  Work around for now is to disable SASL if in use.  , Opened: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/PROTON-508

The issue is internal to the Proton engine and with the current implementation there's not a whole lot we can do to workaround it short of lifting their SASL parsing code and doing the processing ourselves without trigger SASL support in the proton code.

I was able to create a patch for the proton code that works although causes some of their tests to fail. The end result was that the time on my machine to send a 10mb message went from 30+ seconds to around 300ms or so.
, Awaiting publish of the released Proton v0.7 library to maven central , Updated trunk to proton 0.7 need to fix failing karaf itest before resolving this.  , fixed on trunk, all tests passing]
