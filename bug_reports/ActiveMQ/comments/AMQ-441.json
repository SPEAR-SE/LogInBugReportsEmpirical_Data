[Ah - it appears Tim's issue is on 3.x - so this could well already be fixed on 4.x, I did a test using the latest snapshot from svn.  What I did is set the prefetchPolicy to 1
 
 
        ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(user, pwd, url);
        ActiveMQPrefetchPolicy prefetchPolicy =  connectionFactory.getPrefetchPolicy();
        prefetchPolicy.setQueuePrefetch(1);
        connectionFactory.setPrefetchPolicy(prefetchPolicy);


I have  1000 messages on the queue. Started 1 consumer and it started consuming the messages. Started another consumer and immedietely it started consuming messages.


After 80-100 messages, the 2nd consumer stops receiving messages. but when I kill the first consumer,  consumer 2 is still not receiving any messages (i think this is a bug here)

I tried running the first consumer again and it started consuming messages but consumer two did not start receiving any.

I'll investigate this further, Fixed a similar to memory leak scenario in the prefetch subscription.]
