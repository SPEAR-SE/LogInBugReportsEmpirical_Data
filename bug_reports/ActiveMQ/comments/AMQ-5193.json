[What are the Java files you see appearing in the jar?, If I download activemq-all-5.9.0.jar from http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.activemq/activemq-all/5.9.0 or http://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/activemq/activemq-all/5.9.0/
there are 2,261 .java files inside of it.  For example: org\apache\activemq\ActiveMQConnection.java, I think this is related to the change for: AMQ-4549 , added shade transformer that ensures the sources are not shaded into the uber jar.]
