[Sounds like AMQ-4595 is the root cause, grab the latest nightly 5.9 SNAPSHOT and give that a try. , Hmm, the question is: Why does it happen with 60 messages? In issue AMQ-4595, the had 10000 messages. Right now, after some messages have been consumed, there are 28 left, and these messages are displayed instantly.

However, I've checked the body size and each message contains about 20kB of XML (don't ask my why, its not my code). But does browsing actually needs to acquire the body for displaying a list of message ids?

And even if its been done, this would be 60*20b=1,4MB which should be fine when running AMQ with 1GB of heap, shouldn't it?

Also, they were talking about the auditDeph, which is set to > 2000 by default. So this appears not to be the same issue at least from my outsider's point of view.

Unfortunately, this is a live-system. I will try to deploy the dev version on one of our development servers., Hard to say since I can't reproduce it, try a 5.9 SNAPSHOT and see if its resolved. , Cannot reproduce on the latest 5.9-SNAPSHOT.  Reopen if you can provide a test case that shows a new issue. ]
