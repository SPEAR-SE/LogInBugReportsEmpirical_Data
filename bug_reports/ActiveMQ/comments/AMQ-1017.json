[The build works perfectly for me on OS X and Linux. I guess it must be some windows issue.

I wonder does trashing your ~/.m2/repository help? Am wondering if you've got some old version of some jar in your local repo? You definitely have the latest from trunk right?
, I just built the trunk and its working fine for me (WinXP). Though, I did see this once, but was unable to reproduce it. Are you able to consistently reproduce this? Maybe you can try "mvn install -U", I just did a fresh update to revision number 472216. I also removed all content under ~/.m2/repository.

I still run into the build error and will attach the output of "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -U clean install > mvn.log"., The output of "mvn -Dmaven.test.skip=true -U clean install ", I've just patched the pom for activemq-xmpp to see if that helps any - I wonder could you try give it another go please and see if this fixes it for you?, I updated to revision number 472803. The build is still failing., The output for "mvn -U -X -Dmaven.test.skip=true install > mvn.log" and rev number 472803.
, I just had the idea whether trashing your ~/.m2/repository could make the issue reproducable on your side. May your local repo contains old jars that I do not get from the repo server., I've tried trashing the local repo too - and it still works fine for me. I'm kinda mystified why its failing for you., I guess we need someone else with a windows machine to trash their local repo and try again - it could be a windows-only-with-no-local-repo issue, jcdesrochers wrote (see http://www.nabble.com/Latest-4.1-SNAPSHOT-tf2516871.html) that for him the build also fails. You could ask him to help out., Greetings.  I'm trying to build 472933 and I'm experiencing a similar issue.  I'm building with Maven 2.0.4, Java 1.5.0_08, on Windows XP SP2, working behind a proxy / firewall.  I can get through Jaas, Core, Console, and web stuff, but mine collapses on XMPP.

I don't get quite as far as Bernhard does, however.  I fail with this error:

[DEBUG] Trace
org.apache.maven.lifecycle.LifecycleExecutionException: Unable to build project for plugin 'org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2:maven-jaxb2-plugin': Error getting POM for 'org.jvnet.jaxb2.maven2:maven-jaxb2-plugin' from the repository: Error transferring file

from the specified remote repositories:
  central (http://repo1.maven.org/maven2),
  codehaus (http://repository.codehaus.org/),
  apache.snapshots (http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository),
  maven2-repository.dev.java.net (https://maven2-repository.dev.java.net/nonav/repository),
  maven-repository.dev.java.net (https://maven-repository.dev.java.net/nonav/repository),
  apache.incubating.releases (http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-incubating-repository)

I suspect this may be a Maven configuration issue, though.  I will attach the full Maven log.

, This log shows a build of revision 472933., I just did a fresh checkout of https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/trunk with rev 473001.

Running in WinXP, did a mvn install -Dmaven.test.skip=true with a clean repo and it built successfully for me. :-/, Also using maven-2.0.4 and java version "1.5.0_07", I did  a fresh checkout with rev 473056 and build against a clean repository.  Runnng Windows Server 2003, java version 1.5.0_05  and using maven 2.0.4. The build was also succesful for me when I did a mvn install -Dtest=

I wonder if this is a case of ibiblio sometimes  being overloaded?  If you  already have  downloaded the repository on your machine  before maybe you can try an offline mode for your build (ie. mvn -o ). , A build using Debian Sarge works fine.

But a 4.2 ActiveMQ version was build, not a 4.1. As I said I'm trying to compile https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/trunk which is regarding to http://www.activemq.org/site/source.html) the 4.1 SNAPSHOT version. I just detected that https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/branches/activemq-4.1 exists. Is this the 4.1 tree?, I was having a similar problem at work on my windows box, but it looks like we have a solution ... Thanks to Tim Bish!

It comes down to a proxy issue for https.  We had to set the environment variables "https.proxyHost" and "https.proxyPort". The proxy configuration in the maven settings.xml only seems to work for http, not https.

Once we defined those, it built just fine.

Hope this helps., Hello Nathan,

hhmm I do not use a HTTP[s] proxy. So should I just set the host and port to an empty value? An why do I not need these settings under Debian in the same local network?

, Bernhard - do you still have  your maven build issues? FWIW it does seem like your issues are more to do with having issues on your platform running Maven rather than anything to do with the ActiveMQ build per se - I wonder if the Maven User List could help you nail any remaining Maven problems you've got?

http://maven.apache.org/mail-lists.html, James, yes I still have the problem building the ActiveMQ trunk sources. 

Since we did not localize the problem, we do not know whether the ActiveMQ build process or Maven causes the problem. If this is a Maven problem, then it is a very special one. We build all our projects with Maven and do not have any problems..., Am gonna mark this issue as resolved for now; as I'm not aware of anything actually wrong with the Maven build - rather Maven has some issue on your platform (which is an issue for Maven rather than ActiveMQ). If you're still struggling though, do let us know and we can try reopen this to track it ]
