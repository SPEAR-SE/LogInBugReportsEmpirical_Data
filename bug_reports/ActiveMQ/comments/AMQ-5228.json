[Any news here? Right now our LevelDB is growing as well and the only way to circumvent is to wait until all queues are empty, shut-down ActiveMQ and delete the files manually. Without the compact, its not usable so we switched back to kahaDB, LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
