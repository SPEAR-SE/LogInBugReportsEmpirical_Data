[Do you have a JUnit test case that can reproduce this?, Sorry, I do not., Hi Ralph.  I've attached a unit test that I wrote to try to reproduce this.  However, it works correctly for me.  Can you take a look and tell me if you were doing something differently?
, Your unit test had the default VirtualTopic settings configured on the broker and did not have both consumers on the same queue. See attached modifications., Updated SubQueueSelectorCacheBroker and SelectorAwareVirtualTopicInterceptor to handle more than one selector per topic. 

Ralph, thanks for the updated test.
