[You are looking at the wrong documentation, that is for the old AMQ 4.x release.

For the 5.x release its here
http://activemq.apache.org/version-5-initial-configuration.html, Ahhh...Could you put a Note a the top for that page because it comes up in searches ahead of the version 5 configuration page?

Also, the Version 5 page lists:
activemq-core.jar
commons-logging.jar

Which isn't the same as what is supposed to be used?, I've updated the page with more current names]
