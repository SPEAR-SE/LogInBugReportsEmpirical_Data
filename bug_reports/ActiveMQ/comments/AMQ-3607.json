[Can you attach your test case as a file here and tick the Grant License to Apache box so that the test can be included in the source. , Test case attached as requested, Great to see a nice junit test, I had to have a peek.
Apart from the missing setter for connectionFactory.setOptimizeAcknowledgeTimeOut this test is working as expected.
The failure results from the low prefetch and discard limit so more often than not messages are discarded and end up in the dlq.
I made use of the setOptimizeAcknowledgeTimeOut feature, to allow an ack to be sent on a timer rather than on a percentage of prefetch such that there is more control in optimizeAck mode. Without that, once 5 messages are sent, the rest end up in the dlq as there is no ack till more are sent.
If you enable debug logging for: 
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.TopicSubscription you will see the discards the result from the pending message limit strategy.

Some mods in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1208048&view=rev, Hi Gary,

Thanks for your response. I see your point regards the low prefetch size:

{code:title=ActiveMQMessageConsumer.java}
if (ackCounter >= (info.getPrefetchSize() * .65) || (optimizeAcknowledgeTimeOut > 0 && System.currentTimeMillis() >= (optimizeAckTimestamp + optimizeAcknowledgeTimeOut))) {
{code}

As expected, I can't get your modified test case passing (with 5.5.1-fuse-01-06), but will try again once your tweak to add the missing setter in ActiveMQConnectionFactory.configureConnection() is available.

Cheers,
James]
