(cherry picked from commit 021c82859cf4361eb31b21fdbac17655ae9e368d)
, This is fixed, I did not add a specific test for this as it's difficult to reliable get duplicates to happen (This issue only came up rarely, sometimes during queue purges and sometimes not just on normal duplicate detection) but the existing tests should confirm no regressions., Commit 6e468b4540754cad5cd30de373cadc026c998669 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

AMQ-6947 - Update Queue metrics on expiration

The updated dropMessage method only decrements the destination metrics
if a message is removed from the pagedInMessages list to prevent
duplicate updates.  There is also a case where we still need to update
metrics if the message never makes it into the pagedInMessages list in
the first place and that is on expiration so this patch fixes that. A
couple existing tests found this issue.

, I reverted my commits because the issue still seems to exist especially when purging a queue during heavy contention.  I think when I tested before and saw it was fixed I just got lucky as further tests have it still broken sometimes (obviously points to some sort of race condition)

This will need to be looked at in more detail to find the underlying cause for the negative counts]
