[Couldn't reproduce this but I went ahead and added some additional defensive checks to prevent divide by zero from ever happening.  , I finally found the cause and how to reproduce this exception:

<broker ... schedulerSupport="true"> --> call JMX-Operation health() and the exception occurs.

<broker ... schedulerSupport="false">  --> everything is fine!, Tested using this configuration against 5.10 and no issue.  Provide a JUnit test that fails against v5.10.0 or later if you can.]
