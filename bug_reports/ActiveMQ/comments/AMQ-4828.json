[Stack trace, The old web console is deprecated. You can try the new hawtio console instead.

features:choose hawtio 1.2-M25
features:install hawtio

And then access localhost:8181/hawtio for this console.

, I've run into the same issue. Is there a view in hawtio console that is equivalent to the old connections tab?, Yes in the AMQ tree under clientConnectors, I reproduced the issue on 5.9.0 outside Karaf (ActiveMQ as standalone).

As we agreed to remove hawt.io from the default console set, I gonna fix this issue in the "old new" web console ;), Actually, I think that the networkConnector proxy in the web console is not up to date. Even putting the NetworkTTL in the <networkConnector/> configuration, it doesn't work.

I gonna fix that., This appears to be the same issue as AMQ-4998, which has been addressed.  Please reopen if that is not accurate.]
