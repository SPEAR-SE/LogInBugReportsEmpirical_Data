[Attached activemq.xms for both brokers and a set of unit tests to reproduce the behavior., This is a duplicate of http://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2530, I run my tests with the changes posted in AMQ 2530 and it definitively fixes the problem! 

Thanks a lot also for fixing it in 5.3.1 too, since this is the version we are targeting to use.

Best Regards,
Mark]
