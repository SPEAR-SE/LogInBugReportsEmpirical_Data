[Also I found out memory leak in Queue and Topic. During new destination creation storeUsage in systemUsage object is created too, but it isn't cleared during destination removing and stays in memory forever.

I did patch that fixes both problems. And I tested it with creation and destroying 500 000 queues with different names and with JDBC persistence. Now everything works fine.
Patch was created for 5.13.1 version as I use it in my system. But all changes are clear to be injected in other versions even if changed code little bit different.]
