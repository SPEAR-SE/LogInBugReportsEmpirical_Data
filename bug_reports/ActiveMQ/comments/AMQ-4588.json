[We welcome patches so if you have some idea of what would be the best solution then patch away. , Here's a patch that does the following:

- adds JVM parameter activemq.idgenerator.port which can be used to set a port other than 0
- changed the logging to only print the stack trace if trace logging is enabled.

I did not add a test because of the difficulty of properly unit testing things that happen in static initializers and logs.  I manually tested these cases:

- default, activemq.idgenerator.port not set
- activemq.idgenerator.port set to a valid port
- activemq.idgenerator.port set to invalid values, such as 12345678 or foo

I also changed logging levels and checked for proper output in the logs., Patch applied with thanks. , Fixed this in Camel as well: CAMEL-6521]
