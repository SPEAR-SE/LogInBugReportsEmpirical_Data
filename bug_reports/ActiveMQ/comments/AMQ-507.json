[I wonder if this is just a database deadlock? , Have you been able to consistently reproduce this?, No I haven't.  I've been testing this  on the latest snaphot and also the M4 release using the default configuration.  I was sending up t o  1000000 messages to a queue  with 2 slow consumers..  Message backlog has already reached more than 500000 and still havent  been able to reproduce the issue. I also tried restarting the broker and consuming again the backlog messages.  Doesn't seem to have any issue from my end. 

Btw, for the consumer clients, I'm using the sample clients that is shipped with the distro.


, Well, since we can't reproduce, I'll mark it as resolved for now.  If someone is able to put a test case together to reproduce the issue reported, please reopen this issue!]
