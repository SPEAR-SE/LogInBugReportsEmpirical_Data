[For addition to this isssue, if you try to start and stop durable consumer on Topic which had one expired message, DLQ message size increase every time.

Use case descr.

1. run ConsumerDlqTest to create durable subscription
2. stop ConsumerDlqTest
3. run ProducerDlqTest to send one message to Topic
4. wait 1000ms and run ConsumerDlqTest again
5. run ConsumerDlqTest again
6. run ConsumerDlqTest again

Result is that DLQ size in jconsole shows 6 messages., I couldn't reproduce this.]
