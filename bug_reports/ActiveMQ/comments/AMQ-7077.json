[If the abortSlowAck policy is responsible for setting the flag, it can also fire the advisory. https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6421, As I said on IRC, to be able to configure the criteria that ActiveMQ uses to mark a consumer as slow would be awesome. maxTimeSinceLastAck is probably what we would use., Commit 4dee173962a08dbcb88e33f61ec281209c0b9156 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from gtully
