[had the same problem and found the solution (it's a windows-only problem with the activemq.bat):

the following line in the activemq.bat adds "start" as the first argument:
"%_JAVACMD%" %SUNJMX% %ACTIVEMQ_DEBUG_OPTS% %ACTIVEMQ_OPTS% %SSL_OPTS% -Dactivemq.classpath="%ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH%" -Dactivemq.home="%ACTIVEMQ_HOME%" -Dactivemq.base="%ACTIVEMQ_BASE%" -jar "%ACTIVEMQ_HOME%/bin/run.jar" start %*

so "activemq.bat encrypt --password xxx --input yyy" becomes "activemq.bat start encrypt --password xxx --input yyy", which calls the StartCommand.class instead of the intended EncryptCommand.class. the StartCommand.class then tries to load a broker from the uri "encrypt" ...

long story short: simply remove the "start" from there (you'll have to start activemq with "activemq start" then), Thanks for reporting.

Lars, thanks for providing the solution. From ActiveMQ 5.10 onwards the start command is not included out of the box, and you need to start the broker like on unix

bin\activemq.bat start
