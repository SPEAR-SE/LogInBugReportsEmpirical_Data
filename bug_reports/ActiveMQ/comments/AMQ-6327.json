[I'd encourage you to put together a more exhaustive test for the getNextScheduledTime in the unit tests and try and see if can come up with a fix, we love contributions., I'm currently pretty busy trying to get some high priority work done before I take some vacation time. I'll be back on the 18th of July so if this issue still needs fixed I can take a look then., Hey I would like to contribute to fix this bug.
Can someone explain briefly about this bug., [~dhanika] The issue is related to [the CronParser|https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/scheduler/CronParser.java] class in the ActiveMQ code, namely it seems there are cases where the CronParser doesn't return next scheduled time based on the Cron value passed in.  There is already a [unit test|https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-client/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/scheduler/CronParserTest.java] for this code but more tests seem necessary to show some of its shortcomings.
