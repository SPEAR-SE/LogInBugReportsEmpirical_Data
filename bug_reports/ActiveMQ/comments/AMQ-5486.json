[one of my idea is to make thread pool behavior tunable, please refer to attachment 'tunable_threadpool_options.patch' and avoid worker thread from being created too actively ( use CallerRunsPolicy as RejectionHandler), that looks like a sensible enhancement. my only comment would be the current MAX_INT default  appears to be being replaced with 10, as the default value when the property is referenced. I guess it would be best to retain the current defaults., Adds the last configuration option that was missing from this request, all the TaskRunnerFactory and SelectorManager values are configurable now.  , Commit 9a866cf5673c03f5b2a324ec81802fd986a0ad72 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

Default to caller runs policy on task rejection., Most of the idea here along with other enhancements have made it into the code at this point.  , Commit 634b42016a4c347217129d49a4175afaba9666ed in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5486 - allow selector manager to reject tasks - org.apache.activemq.transport.nio.SelectorManager.rejectWork leaving the default to caller runs policy. This allows a broker to implement qos for existing connections by forcing others away
