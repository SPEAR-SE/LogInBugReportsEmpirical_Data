[After further testing, it looks like the metadata.lastUpdate location in KahaDB is being set incorrectly in more places than just the function that handles update message (the add message and remove message functions also appear to have branches where this can happen).  A more complete patch will be needed to catch all the cases where this could occur., Updated patch to fix add/update/remove message command in KahaDB that incorrectly sets metadata lastUpdate location in places., patch applied with thanks :-)]
