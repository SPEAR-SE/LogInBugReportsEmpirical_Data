[Increase timeout for testRandomAddRemove to 15 minutes, patch applied., Not sure there's much more we can do here, the problem is more likely to be OS configuration issue or just a really slow disk or controller. , yep, this test causes lots of random io to the pagefile to really stress the index paging logic. Unfortunately it needs to be run for a reasonable period to validate, but there may be little value in additional platform executions of this test, adding an sunos exclusion may make sense., Updated the pom to exclude BTreeIndexTest on Solaris, and also adds a couple of tests we've been excluding on the Fuse CI.
