[In that case, the default jdbc adapter should work when explicitly set.
Can you try{code}
    <persistenceAdapter>
      <jdbcPersistenceAdapter>
        <adapter>
           <defaultJDBCAdapter />
         </adapter>
      </jdbcPersistenceAdapter>
    </persistenceAdapter>
{code}
, Sorry, cannot test as I don't use ActiveMQ. Reporting due to HSQLDB concerns. It should work if the CREATE TABLE defines the type as BLOB.

Also noted the BytesJDBCAdaptor simply contains redundant redefinitions of setBinaryData and getBinaryData methods in the superclass., Yeah according the hsqldb data type guides we should use BLOB
