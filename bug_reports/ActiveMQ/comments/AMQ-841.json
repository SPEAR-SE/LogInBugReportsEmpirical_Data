[Hi, 
  
     i had seen that the problem was when the URISyntaxException was catched, there was no actual value given to the vmConnectorURI so it stays null. I can create a patch for this but i dont know which is the best approach, because of some issues.

a) shutdown the broker gracefully and display a warn sign that the broker is shutting down because of invalid brokername
b) trim the starting and ending space, and change spaces in - between the brokername. 

, It also happens with other broker configurations and present in the windows xp os.., Fixed in SVN revision 490786]
