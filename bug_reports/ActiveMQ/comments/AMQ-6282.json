[I have seen this issue of the store-version.txt file getting truncated in other situations where the disk wasn't full.  It was seen a couple times when the OS host was hard shut down (powered off, not shut down properly).  However, filling up the drive space was the only way I could consistently reproduce the problem., LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
