[This seems to not be a bug, as its your responsibility to provide the supported JARs you need when deploying as a WAR.

In Tomcat you would need the JMS and JTA APIs, and possible a few others. And that is why you can use the J2EE.JAR which have all these APIs included. Otherwise you can grab the various APIs using the spec JARs, such as for JMS, JTA, etc., ok,Thank you.]
