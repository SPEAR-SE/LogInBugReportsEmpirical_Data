[Implementation of a message consumer which also contains an embedded broker. (apologies for the class name)
Demos the bug., try: 
{code}_broker.getManagementContext().setCreateConnector(false);{code}

the reference to an MBean server (createCoonnector) and the registration of MBeans (useJMX) with a Server are different at the moment.
I guess it would make sense if createConnector was conditional on useJMX, not sure why it is not at the moment., Yep, I tried that to no effect before submitting the bug, but I will give it another go just in case I was being a muppet.
, I just tried your code and everything works fine ... I get all lines until "Waiting for messages..."

It seems to me that you have something else in your code that tries to use JMX API and fails because it is not started. Maybe a web console?, Hi Dejan and Gary,

My apologies, it appears that I am a muppet.

_broker.getManagementContext().setCreateConnector(false);

Works a treat.

Note the main() in the example code creates a Main class not a useJmsBug class, doh.

I'll close the issue., This wasn't a bug, just a misunderstanding and then some class renaming problems by the bug reporter (me). It is a little odd that in order to not use JMX you have to setUseJms(false) and getManagementContext().setCreateConnector(false) on the broker.
Apologies,
Tim]
