[well I assume you bean reduce the logging level instead of increase it.  Tell ya what, right now the message gets logged of the DB operation takes longer than 100 ms.  I'll change it so that number is configurable via a system property and bump up the default value a bit., You will now be able to use a system property to set what is considered a slow access time.  For example you could pass this JVM option to the broker:
{code}
-Dorg.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.LOG_SLOW_ACCESS_TIME=300
{code}

Then if a kahadb operation is takes longer than 300 ms to complete, a log message will be produced.
Default is set to 500 now.  If you set it to 0, then no log messages are ever produced.
