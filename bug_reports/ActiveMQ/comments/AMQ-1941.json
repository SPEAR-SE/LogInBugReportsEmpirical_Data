[i made some more research on this issue and have some more informations.
This bug seems to happen when there's a subscription active with ack mode set to 'auto' and then, asking the broker for a receipt for every following command issued. This lead the broker to hang not sending any receipts nor other messages, and not be able to close the socket as well., Not able to reproduce this on a 5.5 broker.]
