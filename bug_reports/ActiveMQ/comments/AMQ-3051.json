[Attached broker configuration file., Any resolution to this, or at least an understanding of the cause?  We're seeing the same issue with 5.4.2., There has been no resolution.  We shifted to use kahadb as some of the issues we had with that were fixed., downgraded this to minor - because we don't recommend AMQStore anymore  - KahaDB is the default, As of v5.8.0 the older AMQ and Kaha stores are deprecated and moving to KahaDB or levelDB is the best way to go. ]
