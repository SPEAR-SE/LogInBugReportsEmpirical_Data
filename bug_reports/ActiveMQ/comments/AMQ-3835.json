[Recommend you create a JUnit test case to demonstrate your issue., I have absolutely no idea how to do that. I am not a java guy, sorry, StompTest.java in our unit tests has plenty of examples, barring that please create a test case using the client you are currently using.  , Well, there is a test right over there:

I specifically asked activemq to wait for my ACKs before sending a new message, and send 1 single message at a time until I acknowledge the last message. ActiveMQ is ignoring both., Added a new unit test to StompTest.java testPrefetchSizeOfOneClientAck which shows that prefetch of one is working as expected., The READ ACK, however, is NOT., You'll need to provide a test case that shows what you think is wrong then.  , Hello,

I am facing the same issue. Is there any solution which has been proposed/suggested.

I am using stomp 1.0 client from below link.
http://stomp.fusesource.org/documentation/php/book.html

Error under activemq console:

 WARN | Exception occurred processing:

FYI: I am on windows.
