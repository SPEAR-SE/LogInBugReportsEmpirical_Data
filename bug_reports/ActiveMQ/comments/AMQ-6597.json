[AMQ-6597] Do not add the camel component decriptors to activemq-osgi
, [~chris@die-schneider.net],  I think this patch may be causing unit test issues in the 5.14.x build.  https://builds.apache.org/view/All/job/ActiveMQ-Java8-5.14.x/31/org.apache.activemq$activemq-karaf-itest/

Can you take a look? It might just be an issue with the Jenkins environment as I ran the tests locally and they seem to pass., It looks like the issue is some snapshots can't be found during the build.  I think Pax exam needs to be configured to point to the write maven local when using CI, I'm taking a look now., So the org.ops4j.pax.url.mvn.localRepository property is being set in a profile in the karaf-itest pom already so not sure what is wrong with it.]
