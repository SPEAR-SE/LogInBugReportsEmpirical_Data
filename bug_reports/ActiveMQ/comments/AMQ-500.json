[I have made reconcilations between the start script for windows and the Main class such that the --extdir option works as expected.  Both start scripts have definitions for the use of the SUN remote jmx options, but I left it commented out for user discresionary use.  BTW, I set the default port for the process registry to 1616.  I found a host that already had a registry open on the default port of 1099 and found I could not start the broker.]
