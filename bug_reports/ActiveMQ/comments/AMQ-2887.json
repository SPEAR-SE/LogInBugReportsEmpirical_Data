[Screenshot of webconsole., I have upgraded to the *5.4.0* release of ActiveMQ which was supposed to fix this issue, but it is still occurring., I can also see the negative queue counts in JConsole as well.

Haven't been able to reproduce a test case with this using JMeter, however,
I have been able to reproduce this via using an in-house test script which
puts large #'s of our application-specific messages on the application queues,
which are then pulled off by application consumers which also do database work.

+Scenario:+
            • Producers: 3
            • Brokers (network of brokers): 2
            • Consumers (application consumers w/ connection pooling): 2

Our message sizes are small - all of them under 1k.

----

+To reproduce:+
* start up multiple Producers, both of which are throwing 80,000+ messages at two brokers (which are networked together) 
* have the two consumers running on separate servers pulling items off of the application queue.

----

+NetworkConnector snippet:+
{code}
        <networkConnector name="ActiveMQ Cluster" uri="static:(tcp://broker1:61616,tcp://broker2:61616,tcp://broker3:61616)" \
conduitSubscriptions="false" \
dynamicOnly="true" \
decreaseNetworkConsumerPriority="false" \
suppressDuplicateQueueSubscriptions="true" \
duplex="true" \
networkTTL="5"/>
        </networkConnectors>
{code}

, We also recognized this strange behavior - with broker version 5.4.1., This may not be an issue or could be normal, see this article for some further insight.
