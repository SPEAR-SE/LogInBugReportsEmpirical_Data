[The transport listener is not meant to listen to messages on the outbound path via onCommand, this callback is used for incoming messages only.  , Thank You for info, is this documented somewhere? Not clear to me why inbound messages are and outbound are not events for TransportListener. Is there any nice way how to monitor sent messages and avoid wrapping/proxy of Producers on a client? Thanks]
