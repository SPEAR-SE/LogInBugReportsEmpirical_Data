[Class that illustrates the bug in IntrospectionSupport.setProperty, I looked at code of 5.2 and the bug seems to come from IntrospectionSupport.setProperty, look at attached file to see that Boolean conversion fails.


I checked out trunk version of IntrospectionSupport and it seems that code has drastically changed and registers Spring property editor for Boolean.
But looking at RoadMap I didn't see any comment about that bug, so I register it just to see it in changelog

www.ubik-ingenierie.com, I looked in more detail the trunk code it will still fails even with Spring property editors since the class is CustomBoolean.
I attach a class to solve this issue but this introduces a dependency on Spring (although it seems this dependency is already here), BooleanEditor, included Boolean test and added implementation of BooleanEditor that extends java.beans.PropertyEditorSupport rather than spring class.

r783281, If you're using Phillipe's workaround, you still may need to register the BooleanEditor with java.beans.PropertyEditorManager, as PropertyEditorManager.findEditor(Boolean.class) (which is used in IntrospectionUtils) still returned null with the BooleanEditor in the classpath. I did that in some bootstrap code with this line:

PropertyEditorManager.registerEditor(Boolean.class, BooleanEditor.class);]
