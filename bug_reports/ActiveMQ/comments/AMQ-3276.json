[reverted the explicit copy/set of the MDC context on thread creation as the underlying mdc impl used an inherited thread local for the context which makes the copy unnecessary and can cause contention. 
the changes in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1090320 should resolve the concurrent mod exception. I kicked off a new 5.6-SNAPSHOT deploy so if you get a chance please validate., Thanks for the very quick turnaround, Gary.  Unfortnately, the only place we've seen this issue is in our loaded production environment.  SNAPSHOTs are all but off limits, sad to say.

I'm guessing 5.6.0 will be a while?  Do you think there will be a 5.5.1 release in the near term?, 
Just a note that while testing CXF with 5.5.0, I also run into this occasionally.   The CXF test suite will need to remain on 5.4.2 for now., Dan Checkoway wrote:
