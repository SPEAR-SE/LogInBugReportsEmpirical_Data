[This looks more like a JVM bug as the JVM itself terminated with an internal error - so its not an ActiveMQ error. 

Please could you post the log to the sun bug tracker mentioned at the top of the log...
   http://java.sun.com/webapps/bugreport/crash.jsp

BTW its no big deal if you want to create connections every few minutes, but ideally you'd cache/pool them...
http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-jms-efficiently.html, Thanks for the feedback.

I'll report  it to sun as suggested. I just wanted to confirm that it wasn't solely related to activemq first. , Cool - thanks for checking! :)]
