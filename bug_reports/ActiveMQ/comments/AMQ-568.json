[Fixed., Hiram,

I've taken the 2/17 SNAPSHOT, and retested the asyncDispatch.  It is still not working properly.  Without knowing the full pathway of the code, I'm guessing at what the problem is.  Here's what I think:

Your changed BrokerService.addConnector:
+++++++++++++++++++
        connector.setBroker(getBroker());
        connector.setBrokerName(getBrokerName());
        connector.setTaskRunnerFactory(getTaskRunnerFactory());
        transportConnectors.add(connector);

        if (isUseJmx()) {
            connector = connector.asManagedConnector(getManagementContext().getMBeanServer(), getBrokerObjectName());
            registerConnectorMBean(connector);
        }
        return connector;
+++++++++++++++++++++

This calls the setTaskRunnerFactory, which is what was missing.  However, if isUseJmx() is true, then connector is reset / recreated as a ManagedConnector.  This resets, at least, the taskRunnerFactory, so it is again null.

I'm also concerned, though I did not take the time to examine its usage further to know whether it would be a problem or not, that the line:
++++++++++++++
transportConnectors.add(connector)
++++++++++++++
is bad, right?  It is adding the original connector the this map / list, but not the ManagedConnector.  Again, I did not track this one down to see if it was a problem or not, but thought it worth mentioning.

Kevin., I just commited another patch which I hope fixes this.  Could you recheck it for me?

Thanks!
Hiram, Hiram,

I had left for the day by the time your message came through.  I wil test this morning and let you know.  Thanks.

Kevin, Hiram,

Looks like that did the trick - at least with broker-to-client asyncDispatch.

I may have need to set up asyncDispatch between brokers.  This should work, right?, fixed.]
