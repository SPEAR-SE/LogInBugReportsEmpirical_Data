[Have you tried a later release such a v5.8.0 or a SNAPSHOT of 5.9?  There's already bee a lot of MQTT fixes since 5.7 so this is possibly already taken care of. , Hi Timothy,

I tried against SNAPSHOT of 5.9 and it seems to be working.

Thanks,
Dorde., Hi!

I tried against 5.9.1 and the error is there.

What is the point of throwing an exception if a client tries to connect?

Yours
Felix, I am using owntracks.org (git version) as a client which in turn uses paho mqtt. Version is unknown. A "workaround" is a restart of activeMQ., It looks to me like this bug has reappeared in ActiveMQ 5.10.0.  Can someone at ActiveMQ do a quick regression test?]
