[Could this have something to do with the state of our disk message store?, I should add that this problem does not appear in a different AMQ instance, running on Windows 7 64-bit., Attached the activemq.xml with the offending transport connector commented out. Also attached the current activemq.log., Recommend you try with a recent 5.9-SNAPSHOT to get all the current KahaDB fixes. , I haven't worked with snapshots before. I looked at the download area and I'm not sure what to download., Do I download org/apache/activemq/activemq-broker/5.9-SNAPSHOT/activemq-broker-5.9-20130603.145847-73.jar ?, https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.9-SNAPSHOT/

Download the tar.gz or zip depending on your OS. , The default heart beat setting has no relationship with the store and this error, you are most likely encountering an issue due to the state of your store.  Many issues are fixed in the SNAPSHOT builds., I thought it was odd, too, that there would be a relationship between the heartbeat and the message store. What I need to do, but I won't be able to get to right away, is to turn on the heartbeat and restart AMQ to capture in the log why AMQ is not coming up successfully. That failure to come up is what this ticket is about, not the message store error I noted.]
