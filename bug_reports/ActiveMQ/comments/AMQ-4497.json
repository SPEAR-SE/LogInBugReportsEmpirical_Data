[A behavior of the ActiveMQ Master/Slave depends of the configuration of the NFS connection. For example if I mount a shared storage with the `soft` option and break the connection to the storage the master is crushed.

It is necessary to configure the NFS connection to the store thoroughly. But I can't give more recommendation about it, only use the `soft` option when mount a storage directory.]
