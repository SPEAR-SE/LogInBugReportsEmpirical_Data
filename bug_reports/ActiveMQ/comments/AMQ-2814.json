[Hi Scott-

The activemq-admin script has an option to point to a specific jmx URL.  I suggest looking at adding the jmx URL as an argument to the activemq-admin program when you execute it.  

There are many different ways folks run multiple ActiveMQ instances installed on a single system, so it is difficult to have those scripts always line up to the correct instance in those scenarios.  The best solution is to align it to the correct JMX URL.

Check out this JIRA to see the correct syntax:

Thanks,
Matt Pavlovich, This has been resolved since
