[I have similar issue - Internal Error with "generation collection for allocation", requested by the same "ActiveMQ Transport Server: ssl://localhost:61617" thread. My environment is Redhat Linux 8.0, Apache ActiveMQ 4.1.1 and JDK 1.6.0_02-b05.

Strange thing that JVM crash happend on our test server, running ActiveMQ without ANY load. Looks like it's very occasional, since we see it for the first time.

Attached (hs_err_pid492.log) is the JVM error report.]
