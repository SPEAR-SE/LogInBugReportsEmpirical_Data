[This error is normal if you have a client that is losing its connection and reconnecting repeatedly.  , Thanks. Any idea why it would do that?, Your network is flaky, you have a load balancer doing something on the backend etc...., Everything seems to work as it should.  I guess I need to put some debugging effort into this..., This is expected behaviour when the connection drops unexpectedly.  I wouldn't classify this as a bug without some proof otherwise since in general these errors are trying to tell you that something is not right.  ]
