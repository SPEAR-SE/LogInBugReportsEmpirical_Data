[I just downloaded the activemq-parent-5.8.0-source-release.zip and it contains all the sources as expected.  , Timothy you are correct, this is my mistake.  I was already having the problem with activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar and when I downloaded the zip I only checked the activemq-all directory which only contains a pom.  That makes sense in that it appears to be a combination of other jars.  

So is it intentional that you don't include any source code in activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar?  If so that is fine.  I'm guilty of not researching this issue enough before writing it up.  I found another issue (AMQ-5193), in which I noticed that java files started showing up in the regular (non-source) jar file in 5.9.0, so when I noticed there was no source in your 5.8.0 I *assumed* that something was amiss in your "build".  If it is intentional that activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar contains no java files, then I apologize for wasting your time and you can close the issue., only the parent source bundle is intended to contain source, the others will be empty.  ]
