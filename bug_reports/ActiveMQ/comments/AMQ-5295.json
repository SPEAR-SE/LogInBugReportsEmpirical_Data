[It looks like it is not the only problem with mutual authentication functionality.
Once SSLSocketFactory is ok, then NullPointerExceptions occurs.
Debugging..., I've just hit a logging bug.
When certificate is not trusted, then real reason is not thrown.
It is also not logged unless debug is enabled.
And then code fails with NPE in much different part of code not pointing to the real cause of problem.
When problems with keys from SSL security point of view was solved, everything started to work.
