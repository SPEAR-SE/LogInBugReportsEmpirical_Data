[the problem is the synchronization of times on the machines. I have a similar situation
Consumer and producer runs in separates machines (both linux or both windows). If the times of the machines are not synchronized you've got the same problem , Is this a regression of AMQ-1160?, AMQ-2148 appears to be a regression of AMQ-1160, Hi,

I wonder if setting timestamp plugin

{code:xml}
<plugins>
   <timeStampingBrokerPlugin>
</plugin>
{code}

would help you with your problem?, Thank Dejan Bosanac, your solution worked for me. (ActiveMQ 5.3)

Btw. shouldn't this be enabled by default ?
I don't think it's a normal activity to sync times in all systems interacting with the JMS broker. At least it's impossible in my scenario., Worked on Windows. Just moved the server to linux and it doesn't work...

Please rate this bug higher as it makes activemq unusable in mix os enviorments where syncing time is is impossible., I've added a suggestion on how we could make ActiveMQ independent from the System.currentTimeMillis function an add simple support to external synchronization:
