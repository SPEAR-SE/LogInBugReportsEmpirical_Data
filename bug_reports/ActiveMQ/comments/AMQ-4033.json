[The class com.sun.rmi.transports.tcp.TCPEndpoint is having a strong reference to the org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.ManagementContext$2 class, which is that factory class.  There is no API to unregister this factory class., If we remove the custom server socket factory, then there is no issues.

eg this code instead
{code}
    registry = LocateRegistry.createRegistry(connectorPort);
{code}, Its this commit which introduced the custom factory
http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=833376, I think it is safe to remove that soReuseAddr, I am not convinced that it is really a problem for the ci builds. If it proves to be, we can pull it back in conditionally.
We know now it is a problem for embedded brokers., one thought on this. In an embedded case, where there is a third party container. the broker is best reusing the jvms mbean server rather than creating its own. Or reusing the mbean server provided by the container. It is just less moving parts.
So managementContext.createMBeanServer=false should be used, It looks like the fix for this issue undid the fix for AMQ-3915. You can see this at line 503 of: https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/activemq?cs=1382852

Was this intentional?, looks like we need to make the registration of a socketfactory conditional such that we can reinstate the fix for AMQ-3915

maybe only use a socketfactory it if {code}connectorHost{code} is explicitly set. Folks running embedded will most probably (or should) be ussing the containers jmx mbean server.]
