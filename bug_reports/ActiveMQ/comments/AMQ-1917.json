[fixed in rev 690144

Problem: new messages paged in during addSubscription() doPageIn() may not get dispatched using the recovery dispatch mechanism if selectors are present. These messages need to be remembered in the pagedInPendingDispatch list. hense the fix.
Initial though was to always add newly pagedIn messages to the pagedInPending but this breaks QueueBrowsing which depends on the recoveryDispatch, and results in duplicates on the browse queue which breaks the enumeration.
QueueBrowsing may need some separate treatment at a later date.

for future reference, the relevant subset of tests are:
mvn -o test -Dtest=JmsQueueWildcardSendReceiveTest,JMSUsecaseTest,JmsQueueCompositeSendReceiveTest,LargeStreamletTest,MessageListenerRedeliveryTest,PublishOnQueueConsumedMessageInTransactionTest,MarshallingBrokerTest,AMQ1917Test,CursorQueueStoreTest,JmsTempDestinationTest,RollbacksWhileConsumingLargeQueueTest,StompTest]
