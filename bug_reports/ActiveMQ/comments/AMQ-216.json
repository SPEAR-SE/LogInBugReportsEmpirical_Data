I don't know if this is a separate problem or related., removing the test in .maven/cache/maven-ear-plugin-1.6/plugin.jelly (line 98) allows things to continue, apparently successfully.

"maven server" still doesn't work, however., We've performed some refactoring of the codebase. From the latest code to run a server, you need to do 

cd modules/assembly
maven server
