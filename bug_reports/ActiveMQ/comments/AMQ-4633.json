[Firstly you should try out your scenario with the latest release (5.8) or a current 5.9-SNAPSHOT as issues could already be fixed.  Second if you still see a problem then its best to create a unit test that shows your use case and issue. , I have a little more information.  I've testing in 5.8.  The UI bug where it seemed to show double the messages is now gone.  But I found an even more serious bug (in both 5.6 and 5.8).  When you delete the second queue (the one with the extra period), it deletes the messages from the first queue as well.  Also, after the deletion the first queue will not receive any messages from the topic until the broker is restarted.  This caused us to lose 60k+ messages over the last few days.

Sorry, I don't have time to learn the codebase and create a unittest.  , Requested test case not provided. ]
