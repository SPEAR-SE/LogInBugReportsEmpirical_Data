[It seems that this happens only when <managementContext createConnector="false"/>

Simple unit test attached which shows the error when createConnector="false", Fixed with svn revision 888333. Thanks for the test case., I am seeing this issue with 

    <managementContext>
       <managementContext connectorPort="1063" jmxDomainName="org.apache.activemq"/>
    </managementContext>

specified on 5.3.2 broker/client
I noticed that the fix has not been applied to 5.3.2 (by looking at the code)

Same bug?, According to this

https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/activemq/tags/activemq-parent-5.3.2/activemq-core/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/BrokerService.java?r=HEAD#l471

the fix should be there.

If it's a new bug, can you try reproduce it against trunk and create a test case (variant of https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/browse/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/bugs/AMQ2513Test.java?r=HEAD)?]
