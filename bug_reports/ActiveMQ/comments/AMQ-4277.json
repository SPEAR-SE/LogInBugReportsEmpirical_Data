[We posted this problem on activemq user forum. Dejan suggested us to open a jira for it. http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/REST-GET-204-td4662037.html
, We have created a test case to reproduce the problem. Please find it in the attached file RestTest.java. The test case is testPostAndGetWithTopic(), Have you tried this against a v5.8.0 SNAPSHOT ?  I just rand you tests against the latest and they pass. , Thanks for checking it with v5.8.0. Could you please let us know where to find a snapshot of it?
, https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.8-SNAPSHOT/, Could you please point me to the source files for that snapshot also? That way I will be able to build and run my junit test. Thanks!, Never mind, I have found a copy of the source for web-demo. I will run the test and let you know. Thanks!, Issue still exists using 5.8 1/30 snapshot.

, Hi Tomothy,

I modified RestTest.java to add one more assertion to check the received messages. After that change, the test "testPostAndGetWithTopic()" fails with the latest activemq-web and activemq-web-demo code (trunk revision 1442742). Could you please re-run the test when you get a chance?

Thanks!

Helen, I have updated RestTest.java in the attachment., Created a patch from the modified test to make things simpler., Now there's a failing test.  Hopefully after 5.8 is done someone will have time to investigate this further. , Let me take a look tomorrow., Added the unit test and disabled parts of it which fails. 
Moving to 5.10., Let's examine this issue again]
