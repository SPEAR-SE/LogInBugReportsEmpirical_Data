[fix in https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=e8818faf

brokerUrl {code}failover:(...)?maxReconnectAttempts=0{code}, Hi [~gtully] I've noticed this commit refers to this fix as well https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=207d4cdee682b65f3c434b51f440b1b6c28eefbd but it's commit date is the 28/Jul/14.

The release date for 5.10.0 is prior to that, as you can see in Maven Central http://central.maven.org/maven2/org/apache/activemq/activemq-rar/5.10.0/

When is this fix (containing the last commit) suppose to be delivered?
Is the Fix Version field wrong?

Thanks, @Fer that refinement will make 5.11]
