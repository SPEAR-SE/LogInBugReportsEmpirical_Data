[As of June 14, this test fails consistently on most platforms if run alone; if run as part of the entire JoramJmsTest suite it passes.  On Linux when run alone it fails intermittently.
, Seems to have something to do with processing the end-of-browse message from the broker.  If you add even a slight delay before its sent on and the method pumpOutbound calls sender.drained(); then everything is happy otherwise something goes wrong and the messages don't reach the browser. , Just committed a change on trunk that should fix this issue.]
