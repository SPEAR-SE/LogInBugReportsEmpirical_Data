[Not sure what you have going on but there's no code overlap here., Hello, not to be a pain, but I think there is a duplication. Here are more steps to show you what I am talking about. Sorry for being unclear before.
Steps:
# Download the activemq-core-5.7.0.jar and activemq-protobuf-1.1.jar via Maven. Using the central maven repository. You can also find them via the web at: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/activemq/activemq-core/5.7.0/activemq-core-5.7.0.jar and http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/activemq/protobuf/activemq-protobuf/1.1/activemq-protobuf-1.1.jar respectively.
# Expand the jar files in to a directory:
{noformat}
jar -xvf activemq-core-5.7.0.jar
jar -xvf activemq-protobuf-1.1.jar
{noformat}
You will notice that the org.apache.activemq.protobuf package is also included in activemq-core-5.7.0.jar file when expanded.
# After extracting the two jar files, you can do a diff on any file I listed above in the previous comment to show they are identical:
{code}
diff ${directory_of_core_jar_extract}/org/apache/activemq/protobuf/PBMessage.class ${directory_of_protobuf_jar_extract}/org/apache/activemq/protobuf/PBMessage.class
{code}, v5.8 has module refactoring, and should fix any issue you might think exists here. ]
