https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5972 - wildcard policy entries not applied in correct order
, Fixed by improving destination comparing logic, [~dejanb], Mind cherry picking this fix to the 5.12.x branch?  Seems like this would be a good fix to backport., [~cshannon], not at all. I'll do it after I finish the current stuff I'm looking at. If you're at it already, just do it (it should be straight forward)., Commit 70a49b0fa25f97bb7c6c579286acd88abb4e44e5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.12.x from [~dejanb]
