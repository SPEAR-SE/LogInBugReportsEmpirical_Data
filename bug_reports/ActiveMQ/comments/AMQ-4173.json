[The web console is being replaced with hawtIO in the next release.  , I don't believe there is a CSRF protection issue here.  However, this is based on limited understanding of CSRF protection.  If an attack can be crafted and reproduced, let me know and I'll look at it.

Even if there is not a CSRF protection issue here, it would be unwise to rely on a design that keeps the same secret across multiple page requests.

Can anyone else shed light on this concern?]
