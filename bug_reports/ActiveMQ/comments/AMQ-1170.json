[I wonder is this still the case in 5.0.0?, Maybe it's a JVM problem (or is it a feature?).

Set  JVM environment property "sun.net.inetaddr.ttl" to avoid DNS caching.

See http://java.sun.com/j2se/1.5.0/docs/guide/net/properties.html#nct


But if all JVMs have been shutdown, there cannot be anything cached.
