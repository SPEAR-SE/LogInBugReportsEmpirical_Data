, Fix activemq.xml, Yannick, thanks for the test case. Could you reattach (delete and attach again) it to the issue with a license grant. There is a check box on the Attach file page. Otherwise we can't include your test case. Thanks, Add the test with the granted license, I was tracking down a similar problem.  If you run this code in YourKit, capture a memory snapshot and look at the instance of ActiveMQMessageConsumer, you will see that the unconsumedMessages list size never decreases., We also discovered this problem because we were running out of memory even if a Message Limit Strategy was activated., Ran test case against 5.3 - works as expected]
