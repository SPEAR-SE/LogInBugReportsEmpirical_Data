[dejanb suggested in IRC to try the following : https://jaxb.dev.java.net/guide/Migrating_JAXB_2_0_applications_to_JavaSE_6.html

I attempted to set the jaxb-api.jar 2.1 as an endorsed lib suggested in 7.1.2 using methods 1&2 with no luck., On a whim I saw a posting referencing issues in jaxb with spaces in the path. In the exception above, I replaced the part of the path with spaces to remove clutter, unbeknown to me that it was important to the issue. I moved the path of activemq-5.3 to root (c:\activemq-5.3) and the installation completed successfully.

On the jaxb issue tracker this issue seems to be related to one of the two unresolved issues, https://jaxb.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=194 or https://jaxb.dev.java.net/issues/show_bug.cgi?id=416. , As noted in the comments above, this is a JAXB library issue.]
