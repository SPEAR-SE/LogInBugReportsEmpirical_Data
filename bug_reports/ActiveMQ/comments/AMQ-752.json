[Uber jar licensing seems like a thorny issue to me and probably one that's quite a bit bigger than just ActiveMQ. Once I find some time, I should raise this on legal, write up some documentation in the release and then talk to the maveneers. If I don't before you're next release, please feel free to kick me (gently)., I've changed the build so that NOTICE and LICENSE files do not overwrite one another anymore.  Those files are moved
the the META-INF/${jar-name/ directory before we extract the next jar into the uber jar.  So it's now possible to look at the original LICENSE, DISCLAIMER,NOTICE, and COPYRIGHT files that were include in each jar of the uber jar.

Please let me know if that's still does not meet the requirements., I updated the project name to apache-incubator-activemq so that distributions include the apache in it.  Fixing the issues with the META-INF and the having the src distro extract to directory with -src on it, I think will involve getting some help from the maven team., Applied changes to 4.1 and partially to 4.0... I think changing the module name on a big fix release would be in bad form.]
