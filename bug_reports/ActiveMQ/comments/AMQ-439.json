[The current implementation uses a Map containing every indiviudal JMSXGroupID value. There is a risk that they may not be evicted from the Map and this could lead to a memory leak.

So rather than storing every individual object lets just associate hash bucket ranges to consumers. e.g. just say that 0-1000 goes to consumer 1 and 1001-2000 to consumer 2 etc., we now use a MessageGroupHashBucket to implement hash-bucket style association of message group ID to consumer]
