[This patch modifies findBrokers to only return brokers that are not slaves.

I don't know wether this is the ideal way of fixing the problem (in case the RemoteJMXBrokerFacade is used elsewhere), but at least it fixes the webconsole., This patch unfortunately can not work against AMQ 5.8.0 as the signature of BrokerViewMBean.java has changed to not include isSlave() method., Note: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4330 -- this API call is coming back into AMQ, Manual testing scenario:

On unpatched 5.9 kit:
Start master and slave with external webconsole.
Stop and quickly restart active master broker. You will observe the JMS service fails over as expected, however the webconsole will still be attached to the old master.

On patched 5.9 kit:
Start master and slave with external webconsole.
Stop and quickly restart active master broker. You will observe the JMS service fails over as expected, and the web console correctly switches to the new active broker.
, unit test that validates the fix in https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=f5dd1256]
