Some comments:

Given a network of brokers in a demand forwarding environment: Broker A + Broker B in a _real_ network on different hosts (a lot of bugs are not reproducable in a localhost-environment)

UseCase 1:
Start Broker A
Start Broker B
Do a network-split (aka "unplugging the cable") [There is an exception attached that will be generated in such a case]
Create new message m1 on Broker A (that is stored for later delivery)
Reconnect network
Brokers will reconnect with exception (see below)

It is actually possible to LOSE MESSAGES that way. I found out that under certain circumstances message m1 will not be delivered. Even restarting every broker does not help in such a case.

Question: Why is necessary that the localClientId is created in a fixed way?

  From DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.java:
    localClientId="NC_"+remoteBrokerName+"_inbound"+name;

How about changing that to e.g.
    localClientId="NC_"+remoteBrokerName+"_inbound"+name + "_" + System.currentTimemillis();

If a broker crashes and is restarted it would have a new ClientId -> no exceptions on reconnect., the reason for the fixed client_id is durable topic consumers. The network bridge amalgamates multiple durable subscribers on the same topic in to one durable subscriber - to avoid duplicates and improve performance. 

There is a keep alive protocol used with the tcp connector that should detect the network outage - needs some more investigation to see why this doesn't appear to be working, The subsequent error seems related to the first "Cannot lookup a connection that had not been registered" error.  When a remote connection is 'interruted', the connection fails, the bridge destroys it's local connection to the local broker to avoid producing a slow consumer situation.

It seems that the wrong connection id was referred to when the remove command was sent localy.  This is now fix in both trunk and the 4.0 branch., Hello,

I can reproduce this issue in the 4.0.1 release.  The test is performed as in the original post.  I am producing messages to a queue, from a demandForwarding environment.  One possible difference is the producer is in a stateless session bean under JBoss (ActiveMQ RA version is 4.0.2).

Here's the output from the broker..

, We can reproduce this issue using the current build of 4.0.2.  We are running a distributed queue between two embedded brokers over an unreliable network (wireless).  We had been using 4.0.1, but the brokers did not reestablish the bridge when it was stopped due to inactivity timeout.  We tried 4.0.2 and it worked great for a while, but eventually one of the reconnect attempts failed.  On the receiver side broker (called CTSServer) we see in the logs wire format negotiation taking place, but on the send side broker (called CTSClient) we get the following in the log:

This sequence just repeats continuously until the broker is stopped.
, To add some further clarification.  We verified (via logs) that the receive side broker had timed out the send side broker.  Then, when the send side broker tries to reconnect, the receive side broker says "invalid client id" apparently because it did not unregister the client when it timed out?  During this test, we had numerous timeouts and successful recoveries, and then suddenly it broke down.  Looking at the previous posts a little more closely, I am now wondering if this is a different issue?  Should I create a new issue?,

Hi Eric,

I guess that's up to you.  I believe the problem you and I both posted, 
however, are side effects of the overall problem.  The failover 
transport 'reconnection' works, but restoration of the state of the 
previous connection is broken in multiple places (e.g. subscriptions, 
clientIds).

I've peeked into the code a little bit, and I think both side effects 
could be addressed simultaneously, so my opinion is to just leave both 
descriptions here. 



, I've got a feeling that this was related to the timing issues addressed in issue:
https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1044
which is now fixed.

Could one you guys retest against a source build from the 4.1 branch and let me know if it resolves this issue?, Hiram,

The issue was intermittent, so the best we can do is run it for long
periods of time.  So far we have run with 4.1 for over ten hours total,
failed the network connection about 20 times, including both active and
natural failures, and it has recovered every time and we had 0 message
loss.  With 4.0.2 we were successful in reproducing the error nearly
every time we caused a failure.  So it seems that the problem is
resolved, but we still want to do more testing.  We are noticing a large
number of inactivity timeouts.  Our network is fairly low bandwidth/high
latency, so we were wondering if there is a way, or one could be added,
to adjust the inactivity timeout value.  We think we could improve our
throughput if we didn't timeout so often.  If you'd like, I'll open a
separate JIRA case for this.

Regards,

Eric

, No separate jira need.  See: http://activemq.com/site/configuring-wire-formats.html, I've got what I think is a fix for AMQ-734.  However, the fix is possibly heavy-handed in its implementation, so I'd like for someone to review it and provide comments regarding any potential unintended side effects.

I've attached to the issue in JIRA a junit case that is able to reproduce the issue 100% of the time as well as the necessary updates to DiscoveryNetworkConnector and DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.

Basically, the classes were stopping the local broker and bridge whenever any exception was encountered on the transport.  However, some of the exceptions are "ok" and should not result in a stop.  These include InvalidClientIDException, BrokerStoppedException, InvalidStateException, and SocketException.  With the fix, for these specific exceptions, the broker/bridge are not stopped and fireServiceFailed is never called.  For all other exceptions, they still are called.

In addition, the TransportListener.transportResumed implementation in DemandForwardingBridgeSupport never started the local/remote broker and never called triggerRemoteStartBridge.  With this fix, they now do.

I've run the whole suite of tests and all of the tests that passed prior to my modifications continue to pass.  In addition, the test case attached to the JIRA fails without the fixes and passes with the fixes 100% of the time.

Comments?  
, We ran extensively this week with our encryption hardware because we wanted to confirm that didn't cause an issue.  So far I would say we have run for about 25 hours total, had well over 30 network failures and it has recovered every time.  At this point we believe that our issue is fixed by 4.1.  Thanks for the quick turnaround., Sorry - I forgot to mention that my previous comment applied strictly to 4.0.2 - I did not test against 4.1

Nonetheless, if anyone has any comments regarding the proposed fix, I'd be very interested as I'd prefer to use 4.0.2 for a production deployment until 4.1 is released., the functionality of the failover option is now built into the "static:" discovery agent.  The failover option will no longer be supported.
In the next version of ActiveMQ, the failover property will be removed.  Change commited in version 515602.

I ran your test case without the failover=true option and it passed.]
