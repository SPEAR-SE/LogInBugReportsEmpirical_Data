[• ActiveMQ configuration (same for all three servers)
• Screenshot of web console for server3
• Screenshot of web console for server1, Updated activemq.xml file (with new options on the networkConnector), can you validate this issue against 5.4.0? That is where it will get fixed if it still exists. This holds for all the issues you have raised., A couple of questions:

# Are the *5.2.0* ActiveMQ clients compatible with the *5.4.0* server?
It would be probably a lag of a couple of weeks before we could upgrade
our clients to match the server.
# Also, will I be able to use my 5.3.2 activemq.xml configuration file?
(which has the same ordering as the activemq.xml included with the 5.3.2 distribution,
with some performance tweaks).
# Does *5.4.0* address the issues of messages being routed correct between brokers?
(haven't filed that Jira ticket, but was getting ready to) - namely, if there isn't an active consumer
on the queue, the message don't get consumed.

Thanks,
, Have upgraded to 5.4.0 - however, now seeing the following errors periodically in the activemq log
(which I didn't see before):

-I will attach a current copy of the activemq.xml file that we are using.-
I have attached a current copy of the activemq.xml file that we are using., Suggest retrying with client and server from 5.5.0 or 5.6-SNAPSHOT not really enough data here to investigate.]
