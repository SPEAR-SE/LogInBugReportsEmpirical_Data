[This is working as the spec defines it to

"Getting a property value for a name which has not been set returns a null value. Only the getStringProperty and getObjectProperty methods can return a null value. Attempting to read a null value as a primitive type must be treated as calling the primitive's corresponding valueOf(String) conversion method with a null value. "

Calling Boolean.valueOf(null) returns false.]
