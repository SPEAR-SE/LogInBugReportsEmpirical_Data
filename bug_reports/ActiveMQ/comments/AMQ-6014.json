https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6014 - fix up reference counting for durable subs such that ack on one sub does not decrement usage for offline subs. Fix and test
, ref count was off, causing an ack on one sub to decrement usage shared across other offline or slow subs., Commit 92d5efc32ca79b23225a2fa5225fe07083a0c3e5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

Looks like this fix is causing a test failure in this test: org.apache.activemq.usecases.DurableSubscriberNonPersistentMessageTest.testDurableSubscriberNonPersistentMessage

It seems that the issue is the extra call node.incrementReferenceCount() in the createMessageDispatch() method of DurableTopicSubscription is causing the cursorMemoryUsage value checked in the test to no longer be 0.  Not sure if this is an actual regression or if the failing test just needs to be adjusted for the new behavior that you added in this patch., Commit 4318eba4a34ad64b1dad549ba94dadd155149b4a in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6014 - topic store prefetch should take ownership like in the non persistent case - DurableSubscriberNonPersistentMessageTest regression
, [~cshannon] thanks for the heads up. that test was in a browser tab on the todo list but was not getting the priority it deserved. It is indeed a regression. I added a comment at the time and I think it was on the money, the cursor should take ownership of the reference., Thanks for looking at that so quickly Gary.  I'm just trying to get some of these tests cleaned up in preparation of a 5.13.0 release next week :), Commit e3df09b9db09d6cf2834b0beb901c253be9b6120 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
