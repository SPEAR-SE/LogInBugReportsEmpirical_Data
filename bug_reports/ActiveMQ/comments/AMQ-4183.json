[Setting system properties MaximumDirNameLength (defaults to 200) and MaximumFileNameLength (defaults to 64) to a higher value solved the problem. , Seems like a non-issue then.  , If you don't set those system properties and still use long queue names, then there is no warning or error alerting those queues will disappear after broker restart. One solution would be controlling the length of queue names while creating them and verifying against MaximumDirNameLength and MaximumFileNameLength.

adrian, Added a warning to inform of name truncation in mKahaDB when filenames exceed the system property value]
