{code}

The reason is paho no longer being available in maven central. Weird...
, Fix applied. Thanks Ciprian for the patch.

The [original repo|https://repo.eclipse.org/content/groups/releases/org/eclipse/paho/mqtt-client/0.4.0/] is empty. I don't know if mqtt-client will ever pop back, maybe we should remove it and stick with the spring.io one.
