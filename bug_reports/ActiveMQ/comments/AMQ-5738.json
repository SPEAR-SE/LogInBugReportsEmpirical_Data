[Fixed in https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=3a5f127d52f96466bb9e2c660ac5dbbed03ecf1d

This was probably an artifact of some recent refactoring from AMQ-5591 and its subtasks, and the commit handles some related issues as well (removed a duplicate closed variable, fixed some method names)., I noticed this while investigating memory leaks while opening and closing lots of sessions and consumer links on a connection. Some of the issues were within Proton, which I am working to resolve via PROTON-848, PROTON-849, and PROTON-854. The broker will need a newer Proton release to resolve those once the fixes become available.]
