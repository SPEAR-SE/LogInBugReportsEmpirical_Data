     AMQ-6577: honour usePrefetchExtension in TopicSubscription.

    The current implementation of TopicSubscription always uses the prefetch extension feature, effectively ignoring any usePrefetchExtension option set in the configuration for the topic destination.
    
    See: [AMQ-6577](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6577)

, Thanks for the PR.  It makes sense to be able to apply usePrefetchExtension to TopicSubscription as well.

The PR looks pretty good, the only suggestion I have is that I think it makes sense to move the usePrefetchExtension variable and matching setter/getter from the PrefetchSubscription class to the AbstractSubscription class and then you can have it one location and PrefetchSubscription and TopicSubscription can inherit the property., Thanks for your comments. I just updated the PR.

I had overlooked the fact that TopicSubscription and PrefetchSubscription shared a common base class., [~cshannon], FYI the PR has failed a unit test, however the same unit test is also failing on master on my side., I suspect it is an inconsistent test that just needs to be fixed, I ran the test locally and it is ok for me., Commit 687badb4fdd1b738103ab409f4342a82fb0e42fd in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~vveloso]
