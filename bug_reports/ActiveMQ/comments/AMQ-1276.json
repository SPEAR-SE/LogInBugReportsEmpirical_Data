[Just a heads-up: only the third of those (the 4.1.1) is up - but this might be mirroring-latency or whatever?

BUT, I don't understand why the unversioned file should be mapped to the 4.1.2?? Isn't this just BEGGING for trouble in the future, when someone comes along and "ah, this isn't pointing to the last release - I'll just fix that", and all of a sudden existing installations (or at least their developers IDEs, since the spring.schemas finally are working) are all of a sudden not working anymore.

I think that this type of definition should be _absolutely distinct_ - the user should point specifically at a specific version.

Further, there really shouldn't be any automatics involved whatsoever with the putting-these-out-on-web procedure. When it is manually copied there, a release which uses it is given out to the public, it is TOTALLY fixed, and that file will forever, and EVER, be set in stone. I mean, it is even worse than re-releasing a new cut of ActiveMQ 4.1.1 without giving it any distinction whatsoever in filenames, readmes and whatnots, that things have changed inside.

Releasing "just a little quick-fix", which happens to also make a change in the XSD on the "fixed" location, will lead to the problems you got the last time around: Things actually worked when you released it (the 4.1, was it?), they did, but then new commits came in, and suddenly my working installation wasn't working anymore - since the damn file my config was referring to suddenly had changed., I've just brought up this issue on the dev list...

its basically up to the user to choose either the exact version they want - or the generic version (activemq-core.xsd) which is then resolved against the classpath's XSD.

I hear you though - once a versioned XSD is released, we shouldn't change it. Though we could, possibly, introduce an alias folks can use if they like (e.g. activemq-core-4.x.xsd) for the 'latest'.

Feel free to jump on the dev thread...

The only reason I meantioned it in this JIRA was so that the entity resolver matches against activemq-core.xsd and activemq-core-4.1.2.xsd etc

BTW 4.1.0 and 4.1.1 should appear here shortly...
http://activemq.apache.org/schema/

then 5.0-SNAPSHOT is here
http://activemq.apache.org/snapshot-schema/

For the actual releases of 4.1.2 and 5.0, we need to do the actual releases; so they should be up in the next couple of weeks..., Backported spring fixes here - http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=547274, BTW I moved the URLs of the schemas based on feedback to map the Spring URLs...

http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core/, Did not get fixed in 4.1.2, No more planned 4.x releases]
