[My activemq.log file, Any movement on this issue?  I've just experienced it on redhat linux.  Doing a clean install of activemq produced the same results.  The only way to get the broker to startup was to comment out the <include src="jetty.xml"/> in the activemq.xml.

, can you post a thread stack dump of the broker that does not start correctly?, Hi,

I wonder if it may be the case of problem introduced in 5.3.1 release. See the proposed workaround at the top of this page - http://activemq.apache.org/web-console.html (at least in Jonathan's case). In any case, stack trace would be really useful., Not enough data provided to investigate, stack traces needed.]
