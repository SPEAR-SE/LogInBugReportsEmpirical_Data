[This is actually not an issue.
Check 
http://activemq.apache.org/kahadb.html (see the bottom: Slow KahaDB access log messages)
You can tune the value with your hard drive speed., There is a utility in the distribution that can help you determine relative disk speed as experienced by the journal writer thread:

{code}java -classpath lib/kahadb-<version>.jar org.apache.kahadb.util.DiskBenchmark{code}

As to the value of the log threshold, the calculation is a simple time difference before and after the journal and index update, there is no complicated formula and it really is there as a development aid. So pick a large value if you have a slow disk and don't want to see the log entry. Otherwise you will be regularly reminded of the fact.]
