[it seems https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1136

btw the attach file is includes the activemq config file activemq.xml and producer (in producer dir )and slow consumer application (in slow dir). the two applications user none_durable topic "chatTopic.chatMessage"
if configured in activemq as following :
<destinations>         
         <topic physicalName="chatTopic.chatMessage" />
       </destinations>
        <!-- Destination specific policies using destination names or wildcards -->
        <destinationPolicy>
            <policyMap>
                <policyEntries>
                    <policyEntry queue=">" memoryLimit="20mb"/>
                    <policyEntry topic="chatTopic.chatMessage" memoryLimit="64mb">
                        <dispatchPolicy>
                            <strictOrderDispatchPolicy/>
                        </dispatchPolicy>
                        <subscriptionRecoveryPolicy>
                            <lastImageSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy/>
                        </subscriptionRecoveryPolicy>
                       <!--slow consumer policy-->
                       <pendingMessageLimitStrategy>   
                          <constantPendingMessageLimitStrategy limit="10"/>   
                       </pendingMessageLimitStrategy>  
                    </policyEntry>
                </policyEntries>
            </policyMap>
        </destinationPolicy>, oh, i make a mistak in slow consumer application,make wrong url
"tcp://127.0.0.1:61616?jms.prefetchPolicy.queuePrefetch=50"
now i change it to 
"tcp://127.0.0.1:61616?jms.prefetchPolicy.topicPrefetch=50"
run test again ,prolem still happened
and  also try change it to
"tcp://127.0.0.1:61616?jms.prefetchPolicy.all=50"
run test again ,prolem still happened
the new attach file is use
"tcp://127.0.0.1:61616?jms.prefetchPolicy.topicPrefetch=50"
, This seems like it might have been configuration related. Seems to be a non-issue now.  Can reopen with updated tests against latest broker if still seeing a problem.  ]
