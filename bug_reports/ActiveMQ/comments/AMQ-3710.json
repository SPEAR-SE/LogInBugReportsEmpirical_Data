[First suggestion is to upgrade to the latest Apache release v5.5.1 or try a SNAPSHOT build of 5.6 as there have been numerous bug fixes.  Otherwise we'd need more to go on like your broker configuration and logs from the broker with debug tracing on.  , Krishnadasan T S,
you can use some tools to analyze why your broker hangs, suck as GC,jvm stack,thread,..., Hi,

Today  I checked the status of kahadb files. It contains a db-794.log file having 32 mb, db.redo file having 1.1 mb and db.data having a big 5 GB.

Why is this db.store file having such a huge size. is there any chance to have this to cause the above issue. if it is so can i expect it to solved in 5.5.1 version.

Another thing is about db-794.log file. As per Normally log rotation, the latest file will be a non numbered file. But in this case i can only see db-794.log. If it is logging only non consumed messages then it seems ok.

Any way we are planning to upgrade activemq vesion to 5.5.1 in production.



  , Downgraded to major - is the problem resolved by 5.5.1 ?, User hasn't reported back since April on status and whether a newer broker versions resolves things or not. ]
