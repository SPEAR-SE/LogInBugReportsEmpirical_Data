[Joe, does the test fail with trunk? Think this may be a duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2475, Gary, yep it does appear to be a duplicate of 2475 and the latest 5.4 SNAPSHOT works fine; however, the problem still exists with the latest (Dec 24) 5.3.1 SNAPSHOT.  Will it be applied to the next 5.3.1 SNAPSHOT? Or are  folks being advised to move from 5.3 to 5.4? Thanks, Joe, Duplicate of AMQ-2475; however, 5.3.1 doesn't appear to have the fix, rob just merged that fix to the 5.3 branch r896063 so it will be in tonight's snapshot.]
