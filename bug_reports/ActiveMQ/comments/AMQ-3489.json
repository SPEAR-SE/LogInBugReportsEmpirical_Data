[Reproduced on ActiveMQ 5.6.0
 Seems this happens because it is expected that there is consumer connection on slave. And when we follow this flow:
 1. Start master
 2. Start slave
 3. Start consumers (consuming app)
 everything works fine as consumer connections are replicated to slave only when they are created.
 But when we restart slave, consumer connections on master are untouched, so they are not replicated to slave.
 My proposal is to replicate active consumer connections on slave when slave connects to master., Pure master/slave removed in upcoming v5.8.0]
