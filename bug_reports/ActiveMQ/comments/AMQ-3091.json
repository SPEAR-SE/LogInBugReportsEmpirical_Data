[Have tried a couple of different options for launching the JVM but have not found a quick solution to it. 
Workaround is to either use the batch file activemq.bat on cygwin/Windows or use activemq start/stop and start these processes in the background.
, I think the "Exception" was fixed in 5.4.2.

See:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2935

Try to upgrade.., The exception logged was fixed in 5.4.2.  If you still have problems with the latest release please open a new issue.]
