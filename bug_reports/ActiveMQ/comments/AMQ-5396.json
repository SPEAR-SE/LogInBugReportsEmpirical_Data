[attached the jstack which shows the deadlock, Test case to reproduce this (with Mqtt Paho client lib):

* In the broker source, in activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/RegionBroker.java add sleep between the 2 lines in function addConnection() as shown below:
{noformat}
                            TransportConnection transportConnection = (TransportConnection) connection;
                             Thread.sleep(30000);
                             transportConnection.stopAsync();
{noformat}

* Run the broker
* Run the following test case:
{noformat}
    @Test
    public void testLinkStealingDeadlock2() throws MqttException, InterruptedException
    {
        MqttClient client1 = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "client1");

        client1.connect();

        Thread thread = new Thread(new Runnable() {
            @Override
            public void run() {
                try {
                    System.out.println("Connecting client 2....");
                    MqttClient client2 = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "client1"); // should be same client id
                    client2.connect();
                    System.out.println("Done connecting client2");
                } catch (MqttException e) {
                    // TODO Auto-generated catch block
                    e.printStackTrace();
                }
            }
        });
        thread.start(); 
        Thread.sleep(2000);
        System.out.println("Disconnecting client1...");
        client1.disconnect();

        System.out.println("Connecting client3...");
        MqttClient client3 = new MqttClient("tcp://localhost:1883", "client3");
        client3.connect();

        System.out.println("Client3 connected");

        client3.disconnect();


        Thread.sleep(120*1000);
        Assert.assertTrue(true);
    }
{noformat}

* Run jstack on the JVM
, Reviewed the patch a bit and it looks good.  The old context can be safely used outside the sync block as the stopAsync is thread safe and will only run once so if the owning connection closes first it will be fine.  I tweaked the patch a bit to avoid the log output when old context is null, as that would spam the logs.  ]
