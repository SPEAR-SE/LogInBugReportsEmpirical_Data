[Attached is what  I think might be a reasonable patch to this.  This doesn't change who owns the pid file (did not test the scenario where the pid exists and is not readable by the user calling console or where console has been started but pid is not readable by the user calling start).  It is probably simpler to not change ownership as it should ensure the user who called console and created the pid can also remove it.

1) Updates the output of console to include the pid of the running process (copied directly from invoke_start)
2) Do not call exec when invoking jar.  As I understand it, exec replaces the process but we want to come back and clean up when we are done
3) Exit if we cannot create the pid file, this may mean there is already another copy running somewhere
4) Add a hook on the interrupt signal (might make sense to add a few others) but only when this routine is called (minimally tested while calling bstat)
5) Create interrupt handler function to finish cleaning up]
