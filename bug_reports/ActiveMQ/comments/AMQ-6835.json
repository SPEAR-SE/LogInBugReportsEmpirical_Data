[First thing to do would be to test with a recent release as the one you are using is quite old, if that still shows a problem then a reproducer is needed., I've tried version 5.15.0. The problem still exist.
I also modify DemanForwardBridgeSupport claas (added some logs) to see what was going on there. 

And I found the problem is: *Advisory messages (about adding a consumer) are not received by all the brokers(in the same cluster). *

For example, I have Broker A,B,C. The consumer is connected to C and subscribed TOPIC1. C will send a advisory message of ConsumerInfo to Broker A and B. A gets the message but B doesnt. And sadly producer is connected to B, so the message will never received by the consumer. 

The problem happens when thousands of clients creating consumers at the same time.
, is the discarding policy in place for topics - this covers advisory topics also and should be removed in your use case.

, When building a mesh with thousands of consumers. Should remove ConstantpendingMessageLimitStrategy in TOPIC policyMap.]
