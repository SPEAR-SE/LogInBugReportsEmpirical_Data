[Similar behavior to the already fixed AMQ-2475, Looks like ActiveMQ has had some variant of this problem since 5.4.2

http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Senders-blocked-when-temp-store-100-and-memory-leak-in-temp-store-td3467749.html, there are temp files in conjunction w/persisted messages that
are only enqueued w/ tempUsage=0

If I clear the db the tmp files remain until I restart amq (cleans
them up on startup), I've tried reproducing this on v5.8-SNAPSHOT without success.  Would be nice if you can test on a newer version and also a JUnit test would help in testing. , Timothy: for this issue enable fileQueueCursor to trigger temp storage.

conf/activemq.xml:
<destinationPolicy>
...
    <policyEntry queue=">" producerFlowControl="true" memoryLimit="100mb">
    ...
      <pendingQueuePolicy>
        <fileQueueCursor/>
      </pendingQueuePolicy>

We stopped seeing this issue occur after completely disabling pendingQueuePolicy.

I noticed that while the broker is frozen/hanging that producers and consumers can still connect to it but cannot queue/dequeue to/from it., Would be great if you could create a unit test to demonstrate what you are seeing, won't have time myself to try to reproduce this for a bit. ]
