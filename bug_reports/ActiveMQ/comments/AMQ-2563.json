[Attaching sample broker configuration file, test web application to produce and consume messages, and a zip of a heap dump showing the memory leak, Scheduled it for 5.3.1, Resolved with svn revision 906054.

The problematic lastRecoveredMessageIds is removed completely. It was just a temp workaround for duplicate messages. Now we have it implemented when messages are added to the store, so there's no need for this check.

The commit also includes a fix for a cursor problem spotted during the test.]
