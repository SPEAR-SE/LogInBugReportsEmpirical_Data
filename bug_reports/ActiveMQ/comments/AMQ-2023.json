[We are using the mbean operation RemoveTopic to remove dynamically created topics when they are no longer needed.

If the dynamic topic is named "TestTopic" our current work around is to call RemoveTopic with the following:

  "TestTopic"

  ActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Topic.TestTopic"

  ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Topic.TestTopic"


Our tests work as expected... will update if I find any negative side-effects, same problem as https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1255]
