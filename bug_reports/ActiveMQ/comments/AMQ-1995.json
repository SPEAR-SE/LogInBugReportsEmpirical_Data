[good catch. this is a bug in the test, each Producer should have its own session as a session is only intended for use by a single tread at a time as per the JMS spec.
I am running a quick sanity check on the changes as I type. , problem with the test code, it was not thread safe.
resolved in r711617., These fixes will now make 5.2.0 rc3, Hi,

Thanks in advance, You get this error when you call a consumer method on a closed consumer.  Solution, don't call any consumer methods after you've closed the consumer.  

Support questions are better sent to the users mailing list. , Thanks a lot for the quick response.

I resolved the issue and yes u were right i was getting this error as the consumer was actually closed and a web application was trying  to connect to it.

Thanks again.]
