[creation and first use of the temp store on a send, occur in the same thread but from a quick look at the code I think there may be a chance that a purge would leave the plist in an unloaded state.
Is there a chance that the jmx purge operation was used on that destination at some stage?, Gary, thanks for the comment.  No record of a JMX Queue.purge operation here, although I see where you're going with this.  

I assume you're looking at the Queue.purge() to FilePendingMessageCursor.clear() call which then calls PList.destroy()?  Which in-turns gets to ListIndex.unload and resets the "loaded" member variable to false.


I'm not super familiar with the code, but also seems like ListIndex.unload is also called by MessageDatabase.updateIndex?  Maybe there's a periodic thread that runs to unload(), and faces this race condition?

Thanks much.

, Joseph, do you have a test that exercises this?, Needs some sort of test case to reproduce. ]
