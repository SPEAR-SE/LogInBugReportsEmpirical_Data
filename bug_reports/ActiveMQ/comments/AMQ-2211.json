[The activeio-core test-jar bundles a log4j.properties which made our application log to output to /target/test.log. This is what got us chasing this test-jar today., Even worse, the second (test) dependency causes some ugly behaviour with log4j initialization in our environment, as it contains a {{log4j.properties}} file. When ''introduced'' into a web container in our case, you start relying on the sequence of how JARs are loaded. In our case, this {{log4j.properties}} unfortunately initialized log4j in such a way that our project logging settings never were applied, as the ones from activeio-core had been picked up before. And that made it hard for us - during a functional testing period - to diagnose problems we had as we lost parts of our logging messages.

Personally, I consider this to be reason enough to ship a new Maven release that fixes this, especially as the fix is easy to apply. And yes, I know there's a work-around., Current pom has the scope option for test., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
