[you need: activemq-broker and activemq-kahadb-store, Thanks, that worked.  I would therefore propose activemq-kahadb-store be a maven dependency of broker., -all gives u that, with the current default store and well used transports. The idea is that you choose your store module (kahadb, jdbc, leveldb) if you don't go down the -all route., If not using activemq-all you need to add the activemq-kahadb-store dependency to you project as that's where the KahaDB persistence adapter is located. ]
