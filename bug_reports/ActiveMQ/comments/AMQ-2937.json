[I also tested against 5.4.1 and get the same problem, adding wiki markup to preserve code formating., I wonder if it is possible to validate the issue with 5.5. I think the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2736 should have resolved this., This appears to be a duplicate of AMQ-2736.  Closing because the provided test code isn't complete so can't confirm if its still an issue, please reopen if the problem reoccurs. ]
