[Think this is resolved by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3903

need to validate the Full advisory, AMQ-3903 resolved the misspelling and fastProducer advisory.
The issue was the webconsole using a generic producer, so the destination name is not set on the producer info (NPE) and needs to be resolved from the target destination, validated Full advisory works in test: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1361138&view=rev, \\
When will 5.7.0 be released -- ball park estimate?

Would it be possible to get a copy of the beta 5.7 broker so I can run my tests against it? (I'm assuming it would be similar to the current release where it gets started using the bin/activemq script?)

, 5.7.0 is a few months out but there is no firm date yet.

you can get a snapshot kit from last night at https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.7-SNAPSHOT/, I retested with the latest 5.7.0 snapshot and the problem is still there.

No advisories are generated for the configuration and scenario that I have described.]
