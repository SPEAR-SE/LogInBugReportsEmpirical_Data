[Closing this as this is most likely something to be solved through configuration and tuning and is not an actual bug.  This can be reopened if you can show there is an actual memory leak somewhere cause by a bug.  

You should take a look at http://activemq.apache.org/javalangoutofmemory.html for some general guidance on out of memory errors.

Also, version 5.8.0 is very old at this point and there have been a lot of fixes since then so upgrading to a newer version may also help.

If you still need more help you can contact the users mailing list http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html]
