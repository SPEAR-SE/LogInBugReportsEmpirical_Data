[Is this occurring with a STOMP client on that transport?  There were a number of fixes in this area for the 5.6.0 release which I believe resolved any possibly deadlocks on connection stop.  Recommend you move to v5.6.0, There is no STOMP client running on this transport, In the absence of a test case to reproduce I'd recommend that you upgrade to a later release as there have been a lot of issue resolved since 5.5.1. , There's no test here to reproduce and the code in question has been significantly updated since 5.5.  Reopen if you run into this on a later release.]
