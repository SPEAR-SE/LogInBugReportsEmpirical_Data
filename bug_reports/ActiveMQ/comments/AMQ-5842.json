[I am so sorry, i ran too fast into conclusion, the su command can still be used on Solaris bit not in that order : 
su - $ACTIVEMQ_USER -c "..."
Man : 
- su [-] [username [arg...]]
- Any additional arguments  given  on  the  command  line  are passed  to the new shell. When using programs such as sh, an arg of the form -c string executes string  using  the  shell and an arg of -r gives the user a restricted shell.

My apologies : I only checked -c is not un "man su" but I didn't read the "arg" explanation since I always use sudo -u $USER -c $CMD

My bad but I was not completely wrong.
