[After doing more testing, it appears this problem is triggered by use of the setTimeToLive call on the MessageProducer setting the TTL to 10 seconds.

If I remove the setTimeToLive call, or do setTimeToLive(0), I can run the test multiple times with no hangs.  The Kaha Store message still comes out, but the MDB keeps processing all the messages.

Also if I make the TTL time sufficiently large it does not hang.  100 seconds works.

I suspect there is a problem here with removing timed out messages from the queue.

I also tried deploying ActiveMQ 4.1.2 into my JBoss setup and it hung in the same way with a 10 second TTL.

If anybody has suggestions of other things to try or wants more data please I'm happy to try nearly anything.]
