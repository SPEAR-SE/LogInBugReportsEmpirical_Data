[Please create a test case.  , Sorry, I'm having some challenges with that.  I don't see an example of another test using  ActiveMQQueueBrowser.  Is there some other way I should be inspecting the data store in tests to assert messages have the appropriate properties?, Not sure what you're trying to do, but testing a bit on v5.8.0 shows no issues. , Thanks for taking a look.  I stripped down my test case and I can't reproduce either.  I'll dig more, thanks again.]
