[Is anybody there?
Is there nobody get into this trouble?, You can have a look at the FailoverClusterTest.java and see if you can create a case that matches the trouble you are seeing., Ok,I have prepared a unit test AMQ3544Test.java and sent it to your gmail inbox., I was never able to reproduce the issue with the test case given.  You might want to try and tweak it somewhat to see if you can make the issue appear, in any event, adding the issue here and checking the grant license to Apache box will allow us to include it in the unit tests should we find a way to reproduce and fix the issue., ok,I will reconstruct the test case to make the issue clear.
As far as I know, when a broker is stopping it will close all bridges with others and notify it's current connected brokers to clients,but those current connected brokers are itself now.The clients will be updated by the url of the broker which is stopped ,so the clients will not know those active broker url., Unit test for reproducting the issue., I can't reproduce this either with the test case, figured out the problem (at list on my env)
when a broker updates another broker that it is up (or down), it identifies itself by the server name.
once the server name of all brokers was added to /etc/hosts on the client side, all was well
:)
I guess this is bad practice, and the broker should identify itself by ip and not by hostname

I was running activeMQ 5.5.1 on ubuntu 10.4, Hi, this is now changed with some commits made for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3685

It'd be great if you could test the latest snapshot and see how it works for you, Could not reproduce this.  There have been several additional fixes in this area lately so recommend you try a current SHNAPSHOT.  If the problem persists you can reopen this issue.]
