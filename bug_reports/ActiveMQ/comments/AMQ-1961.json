[I don't think this is a bug, just a misunderstanding or misconfiguration of the prefetch size...

setting a prefetch size of 1 or zero should fix your issue - or waiting long enough for messages to be redispatched to the closed consumer., Thanks for your reply. Disabling prefetch for queues fixes the problem. Waiting a few seconds before closing each consumer works also.

So this works as designed then? If you close one consumer, open a second consumer and retrieve a message, the expected behavior is that the message should occasionally be permanently "locked" by the closed consumer?]
