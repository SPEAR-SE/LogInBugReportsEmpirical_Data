[Junit for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3759, You haven't configured the BrokerService with KeyStore or TrustStore etc, so it cannot accept incoming SSL connections. , It's not obligatory, I have configured it (ConnectionFactoryWithSslContextTest) and the results were the same, so I've removed it not to fog the real issue.

So results are:
ActiveMQSSLConnectionFactory works, ActiveMQConnectionFactory hangs and blocks the thread., The current test fails because the ActiveMQConnectionFactory is waiting for a response on its socket but the broker is in an loop on onAccept receiving SSLExceptions because the broker has no SSL configuration.  The reason the method using ActiveMQSSLConnectionFactory fails is because it can locally detect that its not configured and fail fast.  If you configured a timeout on the ssl transport so that the socket connect call failed after a delay it would then work similar to the other test case.]
