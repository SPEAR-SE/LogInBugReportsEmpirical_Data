[This should fix it.., Patch applied with svn revision 1061365. Thanks!, Kindly explain why we are not calling deleteTempDestination as shown below?
for (Iterator<ActiveMQTempDestination> i = this.activeTempDestinations.values().iterator(); i.hasNext();) {
  ActiveMQTempDestination c = i.next();
  deleteTempDestination(c); 
}

Calling delete on ActiveMQTempDestination also calls deleteTempDestination again on the connection.

Please clarify.
