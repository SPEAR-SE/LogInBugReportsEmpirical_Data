[Don't have a Unit test at hand but could build one if time permits., Here are two possible workarounds:
1)
The quick solution is to grant write permissions to user 'Test' but potentially other users could be affected as well and may also need write permissions for ActiveMQ.DLQ. In the worst case all users may require write permissions to ActiveMQ.DLQ.

2)
In case you don't care about these expired messages you can also configure the broker to simply discard expired messages using this configuration within the policyEntry config

{code:xml}
<deadLetterStrategy>
  <sharedDeadLetterStrategy processExpired="false" />
</deadLetterStrategy>
{code}

as per http://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html. Then the permission problem won't arise.
