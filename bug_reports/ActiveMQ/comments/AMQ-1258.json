[Thanks for that!

Unfortunately this JIRA is using the same wiki markup engine as the wiki which powers the website...
http://activemq.apache.org/how-does-the-website-work.html

so I'm not 100% sure of the correct command line :). But I think I've fixed it...

http://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/Getting+Started

Let me know if its not yet fixed and I can update it - or it might be easier & quicker for you to go right ahead and just edit the above wiki page.]
