, Would recommend you test your code against a later release, much work has been done on the network bridge code. , Patch for 5.7.0, The patch for 5.7.0 has been attached., The next release is going to be 5.9.0 so you need to have a look at trunk and see if you still have an issue, if so you can create a test case to reproduce and update your patch since the code has changed a good bit since 5.7, No test case to validate on current version.]
