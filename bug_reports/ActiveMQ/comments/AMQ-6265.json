[Please let us know if this is a know issue and which is the good version to update with to resolve such issue.
FYI
We haven't made any changes to Activemq since long, and no clues on why the db files got pilled up.
as of now we see files are getting cleared as expected.

, There have been many releases since 5.9.0 with several fixes to KahaDB so without a test case that reproduces your issue there's no way to know what might be the root cause or whether it's fixed in a later release but a good place to start is to test against the latest release.  , Hi [~tabish121]

Can you kindly provide some pointer to similar kind of tickets and their resolutions so that we can decide on the stable version to upgrade with,, You can use the Jira search feature to look at all resolved issues and search on KahaDB and look at the dates and versions to see what might match.  The latest release is the 5.13.2 release and will have all the fixes and is on the supported path, older versions won't be supported at this point. ]
