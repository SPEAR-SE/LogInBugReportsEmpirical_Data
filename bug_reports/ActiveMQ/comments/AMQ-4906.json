[[~rajdavies] Hi, will you commit a fix to the trunk prior to 5.10.0 release ?
, It should be in trunk already - you could try it with the latest SNAPSHOT - see https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/, Yes it is, i didnt see it properly, thanks, Phew! I always worry I might have done something stupid! Thanks Christian for the fix!, Git commit: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=11781d3cf2a351ea5f3ef80f29f351ac42d3538e
