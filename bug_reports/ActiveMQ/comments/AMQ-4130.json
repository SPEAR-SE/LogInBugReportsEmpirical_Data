[Not sure what you have going on here, there's no duplication here in these modules. , Hello, not to be a pain, but I think there is a duplication. Here are more steps to show you what I am talking about. Sorry for being unclear before.

Steps:

# Download the activemq-pool-5.7.0.jar and activemq-spring-5.7.0.jar via Maven. Using the central maven repository. You can also find them via the web at: http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/activemq/activemq-pool/5.7.0/activemq-pool-5.7.0.jar and http://search.maven.org/remotecontent?filepath=org/apache/activemq/activemq-spring/5.7.0/activemq-spring-5.7.0.jar respectively.
# Expand the jar files in to a directory:
{noformat}
jar -xvf activemq-spring-5.7.0.jar
jar -xvf activemq-pool-5.7.0.jar
{noformat}
# You will notice that the org.apache.activemq.pool package is also included in activemq-spring-5.7.0.jar file when expanded.
# After extracting the two jar files, you can do a diff on any file I listed above in the previous comment to show they are identical:
{code}
diff ${directory_of_pool_jar_extract}/org/apache/activemq/pool/ActiveMQResourceManager.class ${directory_of_spring_jar_extract}/org/apache/activemq/pool/ActiveMQResourceManager.class 
{code}]
