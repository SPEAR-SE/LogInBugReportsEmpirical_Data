[Please direct support questions to the users mailing list., hi Timothy,

Can you please tell us the concern mailer so that we can send the questions to them?, http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html, Thanks Timothy.

So can we send our questions directly on this mailer?, Yes you can send questions to the user's mailing list but you are unlikely to get much help with such an old version.  5.7.0 is very old at this point so I would recommend trying a new version to see if your problem has been resolved already.]
