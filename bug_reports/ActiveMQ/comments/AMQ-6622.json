[I have tried to reproduce it but it seems very hard. I found an old post on activemq user forum that faced a similar issue - .http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Unmatched-acknowledge-td2955542.html.

, We'd need a reproducer and more information on your client and the types of messages being sent, are they persistent etc.  , Hi Timothy,

I have tried multiple time but couldn't reproduce the issue. Below are the details of the clients:

Stomp producer: using topics, receipts, persistence messaging
Stomp consumer: polls for messages, uses client acknowledgement and is a durable topic subscriber.

If you have any pointers on how i can reproduce this issue, I would be happy to give it another try.

Thanks,
Abhi]
