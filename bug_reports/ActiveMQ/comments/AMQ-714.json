[The attached zip contains two xbean configurations
wildcard.xml defines a last image recovery policy  on FOO.*
explicit.xml defines a last image recovery policy on FOO.X, FOO.Y, and FOO.Z

There are two java files each with a main method taking one argument as the brokerURL
Publisher.java publishes three messages to each of the FOO topics, run this first to put messages in each topic
Subscriber.java establishes a retroactive consumer on each of the FOO topics, it prints to System.out as messages arrive

Notice that with the wildcard.xml you'll receive three copies of the last message sent to any FOO.* topic (in this case message 2 FOO.Z).

Also if you set Subscriber to not consumer messages on FOO.Z you will still receive two copies of the message 2 on FOO.Z, Just commited a fix that copies the policy object for each configured destination, it was previously being shared by multiple destinations which is what caused the problems.  Fix is in the 4.1 and 4.0 branches.]
