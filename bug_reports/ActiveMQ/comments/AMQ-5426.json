[Do we need to lock deliveredMessages on accessing pendingAck?, Finally able to reproduce the NPE. Test attached., Any update on this?  , This appears to have gotten lost in the shuffle.  I took a look and it is still broken. The test only fails for me sometimes (maybe one out of 10 runs) but I can see what the issue is.  I will fix it for 5.13.4 and 5.14.0, Commit 6bfa13b6e707fb3465a9193cd44c478514fcd948 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

, Fix has been applied and I also included a modified version of the test case provided to try and catch any issues in the future.   I modified the test to run a bit faster (takes about 10 seconds for me now) because in my testing if it was going to fail for that run it always failed within the first few seconds.  The test case only fails for me about 1/3 of the time before the fix was applied so it isn't perfect but it's better than nothing., Commit 3856c3999ac8a29171c09de99bd0e8bf9cdaff4e in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

, I reverted the original fix as there was still a bit of a race condition in that it was possible an ack could be blown away or missed if the timer task for batch ack dispatch executed while a message was received.

The new fix is a lot simpler because it leverages the already existing deliveredMessages lock to protect the pendingAck variable and will make sure that everything is consistent.  , Christopher, thanks for the quick reply.  Do you happen to know the release date for 5.13.4 and 5.14.0?, 5.14.0 might be a little while still but I'm hoping to do a 5.13.4 release next week.]
