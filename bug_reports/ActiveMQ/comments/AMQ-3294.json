[After a few months, any update on this?

Thanks,
Luca, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-1928 helps here, it allows you to limit the number of concurrent connections. Set this to 10 and the DoS attack will fail, Gary, thanks for your follow-up!
Haven't tested it yet but it looks indeed as a possible workaround - at least to avoid a brutal crash.

I've just downloaded the latest stable (5.5.0) and it does not include this configuration option in any of the configuration templates. From the security standpoint, it will be great to see this transport option enabled by default with a reasonable value., Fixed by revision 1209700]
