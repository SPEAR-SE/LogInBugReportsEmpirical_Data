Revert "https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6366"

This reverts commit a82bd3cf721e32272b2cf3dee3aa1afcc726c3cb.
, Backing this out of 5.13.x and only applying to master because adding this feature causes some issues with the NC durables not being properly deleted when the original durable is deleted.  I'm going to be resolving this in another JIRA for 5.14.0, Commit 9f7d70ba0d8f0262c76844954b274786e3d7545f in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]
