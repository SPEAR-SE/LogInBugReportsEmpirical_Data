[using tcp://master:61616 for masterConnectorURI and shutdownOnMasterFailure="true" , I got the same result.  I think this needs to be fixed too.

but using failover://(tcp://master:61616)?maxReconnectAttempts=3 as the masterConnectorURI , after 3 failed attemp, it will shut down the slave. so shutdownOnMasterFailure is not ignored in the failover protocol case., 2ying 

Your logic behaviour is result of race condition. Broker is already started when limit of maxReconnectAttempts=3 is exceeded, Fixed by SVN revision 813980]
