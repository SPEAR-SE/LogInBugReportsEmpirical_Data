[Modifying BaseDestination->canGC() for additional Condition ! isActive() seems to work to my expectation but not sure if this should be the fix based on just  semantic of code.
public boolean canGC() {
        boolean result = false;
        if (isGcIfInactive()&& this.lastActiveTime != 0l && ! isActive()) {
            if ((System.currentTimeMillis() - this.lastActiveTime) >= getInactiveTimoutBeforeGC()) {
                result = true;
            }
        }
        return result;
    }
, Added a new test case to DestinationGcTest to show this is working and that the Queue with an active consumer is not removed. ]
