[The property should be: org.apache.activemq.default.directory.prefix
The real difference is that with 5.4.1 the schedular is on by default so a store is created on every broker start. Hence it is now more visible.

Think the real fix is to disable the schedular by default. Ensure the relevant tests have it enabled and update the doc at http://activemq.apache.org/delay-and-schedule-message-delivery.html, tie these together, another issue makes the change more explicit., r1005858]
