[I've run another test with our real application with a single JBoss 4.0.5 host and a pure master/slave ActiveMQ setup (5.2.0 RC2).

See the ERRORs in "activemq-master.log.gz" and "activemq-slave.log.gz"

Logged at DEBUG level, so I hope it's clear enough.

I think the case matches quite closely to the test code in this issue, though the real application does a lot more.

, This was the message from the JBoss server log that produced the issue:

2008-10-21 18:27:06,677 DEBUG [org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession] ID:master.cluster-49988-1224605035095-0:42:339 sending message: ActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 0, responseRequired = false, messageId = ID:master.cluster-49988-1224605035095-0:42:339:1:1, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:master.cluster-49988-1224605035095-0:42:339:1, destination = queue://queue.CLIENT_OUT_TOKEN, transactionId = XID:257:6d6366616464656e2e6d61726b657478732e636f6d2f313530323500000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000:

It was one of 686 messages sent by the same EJB to the same queue within about 15 minutes during my tests.

The transaction commit happened at the time of the ERROR Service                        - Async error occurred: 
  JMSException: Slave broker out of sync with master: Dispatched message (ID:master.cluster-49988-1224605035095-0:42:339:1:1) was not in the pending list

in the slave log.

Apparently there are 2 transactions with the same transaction id!

For different queues, though., Nothing special: it's just a single MDB running in the same XA transaction and sending messages to different queues or topics.

I think I must create a better test application., I think the following patch will fix your issue. There is not much in the line of XA tests in core that can help me verify at the moment. If you get a chance, can you build trunk with this patch and validate.

{code}, It seems this fixes it. I've sent more than 1600 messages without this happening again.
It's a bit modified MDB that forwards the message to 2 queues and a topic and sends a reply to the replyTo queue. (closer to what our real application does)
See activemqjee-0.0.9-src.tar.gz

I've not tested the stand-alone version and that one is not transacted anyway.
Only tested the EJB version on JBoss 4.2.3.


, resolved in r708548

thanks for validating the patch., These fixes will now make 5.2.0 rc3]
