[We'll need more information like broker configs or a unit test.  Have you tried a recent 5.9-SNAPSHOT to see if your issue is already fixed?, I don't have any .xml file since it is configured entirely through java using the properties setup mentioned above.  Its kind of random.  On a clean jvm shutdown this happens on restart.  If I kill the java.exe process and then restart this doesn't happen. 

I will try with a 5.9 snapshot when I get a chance...will be a few days.]
