[This bug is most probably the reason why the option "wireFormat.tcpNoDelayEnabled=true" is still ignored in the broker's activemq.xml file., Also, I think this bug / problem should be given a higher priority, since it affects the ActiveMQ-CPP people.
ActiveMQ-CPP was recently updated so that the c++ client's sockets could have TCP_NODELAY set to true.
But that's not 100% useful if the ActiveMQ broker's sockets cannot have TCP_NODELAY set to true (unless you hack the code to make all sockets have TCP_NODELAY=true).
In my description, I already describe where I think the problem i. I don't want to write a patch myself since it would imply changing the insides of the code and I don't know how you guys would like it to be done.

Just my 2 cents...

David, This appears to be fixed by AMQ-1156, no? , Appears to be fixed, reopen with test case if its still an issue.]
