[After reviewing the test cases and comments from AMQ-2016, my issue is different enough that I am creating a separate ticket.  Moved my test case to the new ticket., This has been fixed with a patch for [AMQ-2016]. I committed the test case (with a few more small changes) in SVN revision 737062, so we can be sure it doesn't repeat in the future. The test case is modified a bit, since you shouldn't start your groups with sequence 0. It will automatically close the group and cause test to fail. Changing it to 1, makes this test pass. ]
