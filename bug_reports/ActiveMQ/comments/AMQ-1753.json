[I'm confused about what you mean by "Not a Problem".  Is it fixed?  Is the OSGi spec being interpreted correctly (I don't think so, so I'd like to hear an argument in favour before the issue is simply closed with no comment).  Thanks., This is not the forum to discuss OSGi syntax for the MANIFEST.MF file.

That is better to do in OSGi communities.]
