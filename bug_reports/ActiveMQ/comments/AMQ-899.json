[Apparently "qdox.JavaDocBuilder" has issues with anonymous inner classes. Converting replyToBridges field initialization to named inner class fixed the issue for JMSConnector. But it fails on the next class JournalPersistenceAdapter on "periodicCheckpointTask" field initalization that uses similar construct. 

Is this qdox.JavaDocBuilder something new and untested? , I beleive the change #436909 to trunk/pom.xml is the root cause. My local build was fixed after I've applied the following change to pom.xml:

, I was wrong looking at the different module. The problem still present., I've encountered this issue and the problem could be qdox-1.6 used by the maven-xbean-plugin. Workaround that I can think of for now, is to use qdox-1.5 (but I have to hack the pom of xbean, not good.) or to maybe try downgrading to a lower version of xbean 2.5 maybe? (haven't tried this yet though. :) ), Was fixed by issue AMQ-901]
