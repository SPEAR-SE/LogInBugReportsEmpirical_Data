[I'd recommend you test against the latest release, or the latest 5.9.SNAPSHOT build to see if you can reproduce this.  , Hi

We've found the problem. It seems a client problem. The client was using a JmsTemplate Spring object to send JMS messages to ActiveMq instance, and it seems that it was creating a new connection every time a message was sent. As the configuration was set in failover mode, a new connection was also created to "inactive" ActiveMQ instance, but that one was not closed because it was not ever used. (It was only closed when client was shut down)

I close the issue. Thank you very much and sorry for any inconvenience.

Regards., This was not any ActiveMQ problem but client one]
