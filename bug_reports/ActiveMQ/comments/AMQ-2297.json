[Initial commits in revs 786767 (trunk) and 786768 (6.0).  As noted on dev list protobuf in 6.0 needs more attention.

Lots of tests fail for me in both builds.  

To deploy use -Papache-release.  You'll need something like this in your settings.xml:

        <profile>
            <id>apache-release</id>
            <properties>
                <gpg.passphrase>...your gpg passphrase.......</gpg.passphrase>
            </properties>
        </profile>
, Removing 5.3.0 from this issue's "fix versions", since it's now focused only on improving 6.0 build, Since this is directed at 6.0 new issues should be opened as needed in the Apollo Jira database.]
