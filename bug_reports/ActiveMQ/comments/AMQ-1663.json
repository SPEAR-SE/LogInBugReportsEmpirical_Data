[You can set the following system properties:

MaximumDirNameLength
MaximumFileNameLength

to configure your way around this, Rob,

This is not a viable option.  As I indicated, I already did that - I set it to 200.  But, fundamentally, given a sufficiently large topic naming convention, it is possible to create a collision.

In our environment, we actually do not need to recover an AMQBroker on existing files, so our AMQBroker restart just deletes the persistent directory.  However, we do utilize and need the persistence.  So, to get around this problem right now, I've changed the HashIndex.java to use a static sequence number to name the files, rather than using the whole name.  I started out using name.hashCode(), which I think would be fine, but could in theory have a collision.  Seems to me the final solution would need to incorporate some sort of file index file, so that you could map the "real" names to some opaque naming convention that would guarantee the file name is not too long, and also guarantee no file name collisions.]
