[I now know the reason why Java JMS client message I was sending to 
Perl Stomp client did not get to Perl side. The reason is the Java JMS
client sending Bytes message and The Net::Stomp module's receive_frame()
could not read the socket. Everytime it reads zero length bytes.

But if I sent Text message from the JMS client, no problem receiving it
on the Perl side.

This seems to be more of the Net::Stomp package problem
with binary data which I need to debug and file report.

Therefore, we need to close this bug report as invalid., This is not ActiveMQ problem as such. This is more of the
Perl Net::Stomp package dealing with binary data
reading., I've made a modification to the Net::Stomp 0.31 package so that it can support receiving TextMessage and ByteMessages.  We need to feed this back to the upstream maintainer so that it can get back on CPAN., I have reviewed Hiram's patch and it is fine. I have tested mine and
will make it available. I will let Leon handle the two patches
to choose from.]
