[The problem is that getBlob is being called on the wrong column in OracleJDBCAdapter.
Line 62 should be:
        Blob aBlob = rs.getBlob(index);
instead of:
        Blob aBlob = rs.getBlob(1);
, Fix to OracleJDBCAdapter, Many thanks for the patch! Patch applied in SVN if you wanna try it out - otherwise it'll be in 4.0-M5]
