[Easiest way to reporduce it to run the broker on a machine connected with a ethernet cable to 2nd machine.
Run the producer example on the second machine with:
ant producer -DsleepTime=100 -Dmax=100000 -Durl='failover://(tcp://firstmachine:61616)'
and connect and disconnect the ethernet cable between the machines.  If debug logging is enable on the broker, you should see the error., fixed in 4.0 branch rev 440548, fix applied to trunk in rev 440588]
