[I've been able to get a test case to work if the url is modified to "static://ldap://<ip>:<port>", and I think this is what was intended. The  code definitely assumes that there is a broker protocol to be stripped off in front of the ldap protocol (or any other for that matter).

It could be the documentation just needs to be update to show this., Hi Mark

Many thanks for your response.

I tried using a broker protocol scheme of static in the LDAP URI (AMQ 5.9.0) as you mentioned in your comment and a "malformed URL" exception was logged by the broker:

My LDAP configuration in the above test is:

       <networkConnectors>
            <ldapNetworkConnector uri="static://ldap://172.31.67.192:389"
                            base="dc=tmts,dc=net"
                            anonymousAuthentication="true"
                            searchFilter="(!(cn=esb1))"
                            searchScope="SUBTREE_SCOPE"
                            dynamicOnly="true"
                            networkTTL="2"
                            prefetchSize="1"
                            conduitSubscriptions="true"
                            decreaseNetworkConsumerPriority="false"
                            />       
        </networkConnectors>

Perhaps you were testing on a later version of AMQ? 

Irrespective of the above, logically if the code was written to intend the broker protocol scheme name to be mandatory as you state then the URI form:

ldap://<ip> should also be rejected with an error by the code along with ldap://<ip>:<port>. 

However, currently the form ldap://<ip> is accepted. This seems a bit odd given thrust of your explanation.

So either way from my perspective there is a deficiency in the code such that the error checking of the broker protocol scheme name is either not applied consistently or not applied correctly. It does not look like just a documentation issue to me.

In my own case I was using the failover protocol in production code, so the issue did not actually affect us - it was just something we discovered during testing of various configurations that we thought the Apache ActiveMQ team might want to be aware of.

Many thanks for your help with this.

, I agree, it doesn't seem consistent. I'll try to find what was actually intended and maybe fix the code.]
