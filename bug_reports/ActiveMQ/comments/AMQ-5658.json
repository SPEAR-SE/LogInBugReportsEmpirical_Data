[are you using checkForCorruptJournalFiles and checksumJournalFiles?

If you are, any corrupt journal regions should be removed from the index so should not be attempted to be read.

Please add your kahadb configuration and maybe a full stack trace to the exceptions. There may be a case for dealing
with the exception at a lower level.

Unfortunately there is not much in the line of tooling that can help in this case., No configuration or logs provided or full exception traces.  ]
