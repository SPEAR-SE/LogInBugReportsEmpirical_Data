[This exception is thrown from TransportConnection.java, from the function processAddConnection():

///
     try {
            broker.addConnection(context, info);
        } catch (Exception e) {
//

To resolve it we can just check if the connection is already added to the broker before adding it again :)

More proper solution would be to fix the call to processAddConnection() and avoid calling if the connection already established.

 
, This might work to resolve the problem but needs to be verified - 

try {

        	//////
        	CopyOnWriteArrayList<TransportConnection> connList = connector.getConnections();
        	for (TransportConnection transConn : connList) {
        		
        		String connId = transConn.getConnectionId();
        		
        		if (connId.equals(info.getConnectionId().toString())) {
        			return null;
        		}
        		
        	}
        	/////
            broker.addConnection(context, info);
        } catch (Exception e) {
, Can anybody suggest whether there is fix available for this InvalidClientIDException ? We are using activemq 5.12.3 version and facing same exception.

Can we apply above solution provided by E[~kudi].

Thank you]
