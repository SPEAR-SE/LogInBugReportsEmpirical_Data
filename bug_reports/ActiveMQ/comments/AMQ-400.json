[This happens if your machine can't get to the activemq site (e.g. you're firewalled, or the site is down)

This will go away if you do a:
System.setProperty("activemq.check_for_dtd_update", "false");

IMHO, the DTD resolver should default to NOT checking for the DTD remotely. I mean, why on earth would you want to be getting a new version if you're using a versioned release?, Thanks for the info. It also happens that the file at "http://activemq.org/dtd/3.2/activemq.dtd" does not even exist anymore (404 error). , related to AMQ-424

activemq now uses xssd]
