[Any idea how to reproduce this error?

Does 3.1 fix your error?, I've tried it agains 3.1M6 and it wasn't fixed then.
To reproduce:
- Create and start a producer that will send messages to a queue until it is full (i.e until messages like 'Queue is full...' start appearing in the activemq log file)
- Stop the producer
- Shutdown the activemq server
- Start the activemq server
- Start a consumer for the queue above.

After a while the ' Queue is full...' messages starts appearing in the log file. The consumer never gets a chance to consume the messages since at this point the queue is still being recoevered.
The queue will never be recovered since it's waiting for some messages to be dequeued. Deadlock., This looks like it could be the same issue, Juliano,

I've just commited a fix for this to CVS that should fix the problem.  ]
