[I'm not sure this is a bug as I don't see anywhere in our docs that indicates that the we intended for these to be created on start-up as opposed to the normal on-demand creation we normally do.  You can work around this by adding to your static destination list above.  

{code}
    <destinations>
      <queue physicalName="FOO.BAR.COM"/>
      <queue physicalName="FOO.BAR"/>
    </destinations>
{code}, I agree with Tim, same workaround came to my mind. The virtual nature of a destination is a behaviour modification, but does not override auto creation., In a network or brokers would it be possible for messages to be forwarded to networked brokers on FOO.BAR before be distributed to virtual destinations? Could this cause duplicate messages?, Also, if a consumer subscribed to the new queue 'FOO.BAR', would it then compete for messages with the composite destination(s), causing some messages to not make it through to consumers of the composite destinations?, with networks, either the virtual dest or the original target needs to forwarded, not both. Assuming all brokers have the virtual dest configured in the same way that is.

W.r.t competing; the virtual bits are done as part of an interceptor on the send call, so the message goes to the target and the additional virtual dests before there is any dispatch. So there is no competition with consumers.]
