[A more realistic sequence of events is this:
# ConsumerA sends RequestB to QueueC, with a reply-to of TempQueueD.
# ProducerE receives RequestB and starts sending messages back to TempQueueD.
# ConsumerA runs out of memory and dies, the broker closes the connection.
# ProducerE continues sending messages to TempQueueD until the broker Usage Manager Memory Limit is reached. From this point no producer can send any messages to any temporary queues.
# The sysadmins discover something is wrong and kill ProducerE, the broker claims to free up the resources, however the problem remains., Fixed in 5.3.1 by SVN  revision 912656
