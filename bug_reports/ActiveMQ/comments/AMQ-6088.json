The runtime plugins will now find the exact policy to update which means
that a destination can match more than one policy and the policy can
still be updated at runtime.

The java runtime broker also supports the ability to replace or add a
policy entry based on a flag on a new method call.

(cherry picked from commit 9e7fae0d83c584f98e99024ba6d20e53f14b81f7)
, A policy can now be modified even if it matches more than one destination because the policy will only be applied to the correct destination(s) during update.  This includes the case of a new policy as well.  This applies to both the Java and XML runtime plugins.

Also, there's a new option in the Java plugin to create or replace (based on a flag) a policy entry.  For the replace case, that is useful if someone wants to update a policy without looking up the existing one first, which is required in the current version.]
