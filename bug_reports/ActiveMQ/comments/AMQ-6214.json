[The fix is to clear the cache of groups reverted map, so that the mapping of group membership will be reloaded.

One line of new code in ReloadableProperties class fixed the problem:

Line 53:    

invertedValueProps = null;, Attached configuration files for using JAAS with reloadable properties for users and groups.

Activemq is configured to use properties for users, groups with reload flag set to true, and authorization policy is such that changes in authorization policy is reloaded at runtime by the runtimeConfigurationPlugin.

Tests showed that the group membership is not dynamically reloaded at runtime without the fix.  The fix works well for the problem., Commit 2788bd55845d35ffb753f20ea1fee9711e85fe43 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Fixing ReloadableProperties so that the groups file will be properly
