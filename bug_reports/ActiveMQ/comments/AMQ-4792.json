[Suggest that you test against a recent 5.9-SNAPSHOT since there's been a lot of work on AMQP support since 5.8.0 was released
, Just tried this with 5.9-20131008.043154-110, but with that version the send operation "hangs" even with the "aqmp" transport.

Also, I tested AMQP send over aqmp+nio using SwiftMQ client (9.4.0) with ActiveMQ 5.8.0.
With that set up I get the following error:
com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.UnsupportedProtocolVersionException: Connection was asynchronously closed
	at com.swiftmq.amqp.v100.client.Connection.connect(Unknown Source)
	at SenderNonTransacted.main(SenderNonTransacted.java:128), Hi Marko.  Can you take a look at the attached test, and see if you can update it so that it behaves the same way as your example?  I tried to follow your code, but it's failing in a different way for me.
, Hi Kevin.
I placed the class in ActiveMQ 5.8.0 source tree in activemq-amqp module (under test). Had to make some small changes to make it compile (nioPort, method throws declarations).

There's no errors from the test but based on the output it looks like the test client tries to connect to an incorrect port (see attached output).
Also, the output doesn't include any mention of amqp-nio connector being started., Hi Marko,  That test won't work against the 5.8 source, because the version of AmqpTestSupport in 5.8 doesn't start an nio connector.  

In order to fix this we need a unit test that works against the trunk.  Can you try that?

 , provided test doesn't work against the version specified.  Can't reproduce this on trunk or in 5.9.0.  Reopen if you can provide a test against the latest version that shows a problem.  ]
