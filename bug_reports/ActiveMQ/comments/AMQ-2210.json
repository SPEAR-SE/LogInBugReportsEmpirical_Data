[The intention of that wait is to allow a master/slave broker to start or restart and redeliver messages before an outstanding ack from a client is processed. In a network of brokers scenario, any unacked message will remain on the original broker so it will never get redelivered. In this case, it makes sense to get an unmatched ack exception.
The simple fix is to limit that wait to a few seconds and process the ack in the normal way even if the wait expires. Worst case scenario there is an unmatched ack exception and the message is eventually redelivered and should be seen as a duplicate.

So failover among a network of brokers will always be a little more lossy in terms of message ordering than master slave., resolved in r765921
