[To be more clear:
If you set dataDirectory="${activemq.base}/data" on <broker> and do not set directory attribute on <amqPersistenceAdapter>, the structure obtained is the one described in documentation
Otherwise if you set directory="activemq-data", structure will be in folder bin
Finally if you set configuration as in attached file the structure is not as described in documentation, is it a bug or a feature ?, AMQ store is deprecated in v5.8.0+]
