[What is the status on this? 

This happens in the latest releases (5.3.0 and 5.3.1) as well. We also noticed that the redelivery count also re-sets to 0.

Thanks!

 , To resolve this, the message needs to get stored twice or on each redelivery attempt. currently the redelivery state is maintained only in memory. It is unlikely that this issue will be resolved in the short term because the stores would need to accept duplicates or updates which they are not designed for., Not feasible with the current architecture.  ]
