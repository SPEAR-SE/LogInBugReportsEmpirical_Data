[JMX consle, there is 2 classes (Client = BrokerA  and Server = BrokerB ) for reproducing a problem, Fixed with svn revision 942131.

The problem was with destination infos not being propagated to the remote broker, so temp destination were kept lingering.

However, I think your solution with new temp queue for every message is not optimal, and you should use one temp queue and correlation id. See http://activemq.apache.org/how-should-i-implement-request-response-with-jms.html for more info, tnx Dejan]
