[I made that modification of the destination and setting of the original destination configurable in [AMQ-6100] b/c there is no good place to put that property in an AMQP message at the moment.

The amqp message application properties are immutable and the message annotations are not easy to access client side., Thanks for the quick message.

We did try the setOriginalDestination=false on the latest code and it did avoid to override the "to" address of the AMQP message. Hopefully this can be back ported into the 5.15 code train so it is released soon.

Even with this workaround, it would be desirable to have an "attribute" of some sort in the AMQP message where the original MQTT topic is stored and that is readable via the AMQP Proton client , Would it be possible to add the original destination - original MQTT topic for the MQTT protocol - as a message annotation as it is done for the MQTT QoS?

 

We are able to easily retrive the original MQTT QoS with the following AMQP client code.

            Object activeMqQos = message.getApplicationProperties().getValue().get("ActiveMQ.MQTT.QoS");

 

The original MQTT topic could be passed to AMQP consumer in the same way.

Thanks.

 , [~mcarrer] Both things are valid improvements. We should add JMS original destination to the AMQP message annotations.

As your other idea is specific to MQTT it better to raise a new issue to track it separately., AMQP Application Properties are immutable for the AMQP messages that pass through the broker.  For other conversions it doesn't make sense to add broker specific information in Application Properties.  If added it should be done as a generic message annotation (not something JMS tagged as has been suggested in other places).  Something like x-opt-original-destination or the like in the message annotations should be done if anything.]
