[Note, I tried it with and without the maxInactivityDuration flag set, same result...., Note, by using workarounds, described in AMQ-1577 and AMQ-1578, this problem has been resolved in my environment.

I'm thinking that resolution of those 2 issues will reduce the spamming of these exceptions every 30 seconds, etc.

The problem in my case stems directly from using PooledConnections (see AMQ-1578)...., I've tweaked the logging to not log the stack traces to WARN to reduce the clutter, but maintained the failed connection and successful reconnect as is.
