Jonas,

If you get a chance could you see if you could reproduce the issue reported., 
I created a producer/consumer based from the config that was given (ie. using  jndi, topic and queue are received synchronously, failover:tcp transport, etc) but can't seem to reproduce it. I ran my producer/consumer for a few minutes then   shutdown the broker .  The cpu for both my producer and consumer also went down.  Im testing this using  on  (svn head 01-19-06).  ]
