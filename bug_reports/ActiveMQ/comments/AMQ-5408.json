[Adding the conf I'm using. Can't include the client keystore because it's a real certificate. Tried to use keystores in the dist (client.ks, client.ts) but the certificate in client.ks has expired so that doesn't work..., Is this the same bug as AMQ-5943, which we fixed two days ago? , From what I read in AMQ-5943 it sounds like the same bug, but I havn't been able to verify it., Appears to duplicate AMQ-5943, test with a current nightly and if the problem remains then please reopen.  ]
