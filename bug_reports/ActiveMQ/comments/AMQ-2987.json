[surefire report with test case failures., Some of the tests have timing dependencies that cause them to fail intermittently on various platforms, we are constantly working to improve the tests in this regard so any help is appreciated.

Are the failures reproducible when run individually and does trunk behave the same?
for example, when an individual test is run like:{code}
mvn test -Dtest=X
{code}, Many tests have been improved to prevent timing failures, reopen if problem are seen on next release.]
