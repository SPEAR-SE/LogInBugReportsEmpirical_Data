[Fritz  <foconer@exist.com> was able to confirm:

Hi,

I was able to replicate the message thrown in the console "Message probably
expired: null". This seems to happen only when consumer is durable and
delivery mode is persistent. I tried the other scenario and it worked fine.

We will add this issue to Jira to be fixed for future release.

Regards,
Fritz
, Fritz,

I just commited a change to the Journal and pushed out a new SNAPSHOT out.  Could you re-test and let me know if the new SNAPSHOT resolves the "Message probably expired: null" problem?

Thanks,
Hiram , Fixed.]
