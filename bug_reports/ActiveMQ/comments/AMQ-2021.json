[resolved in r729038.
Problem is in dispatch to the DLQ for topics. A property is set in the message before dispatch to the DLQ but this can invalidate the message for delivery to other topic subscribers. The failure can be a little odd as it can result in empty properties at the consumer or marshal errors.
The solution is to copy the message before making modifications., ps: thanks for the test case :-) I committed a variant of it that catches the various failure scenarios.]
