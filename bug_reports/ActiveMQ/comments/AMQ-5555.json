[You might want to test against 5.10.1 as there are some leaks fixes in there already.  Otherwise you should try to describe your configuration and use case before anyone can offer any insights.  Test cases that reproduce the situation are also a good idea.  , I'll attach the heapdump screenshots with 5.10.1.
It's showing up there as well as far as I can see.

Use case:
The broker is more or less idle, passing almost no messages around when this occurs.
What is a bit special is that the broker is frequently polled via the statistics plugin to retrieve statistics about all its queues (ie. a message sent to ActiveMQ.Statistics.Destination.>).

, Attached amq-heapdump2.jpg to show the difference to amq-headump.jpg a few days ago.

Drilling down via ProducerBrokerExchange I can see 133 (Managed)TransportConnection instances.

Many of these TransportConnection instances keep a large number of ProducerBrokerExchange instance in their "producerExchanges" HashMap.

It seems for whatever reason they are not consistently removed.
They are created inside TransportConnection.getProducerBrokerExchange()., Was there a PooledConnectionFactory in use here?  Have you tested against 5.10.2 ?

This could be: AMQ-5564, Thanks for the pointer.  Indeed there is an org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory in use.
We've since upgraded to 5.11.1 and I'll have a look again (asap) to see if the situation has changed.

, Given the information provided this appears to be the same issue.  If not please reopen and attach a reproducer so we can track it down., That's likely true. We no longer see the issue with 5.11.1. 
Also we since stopped using the StatisticsPlugin and instead poll stats via JMX and distribute them via a topic.]
