[jstack trace of slave shutdown, It could help if ActiveMQServiceFactory would do an async start., My local fix for this issue is to start the the broker async and only wait in case it is the Master:

+       broker.setStartAsync(true);
        broker.start();
+       if (!broker.isSlave())
          broker.waitUntilStarted();
        brokers.put(pid, broker);

    [AMQ-6601] AMQ with master and slave broker, shutting down slave causes a dead-lock

    This PR addresses the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6601.
    
    The proposed solution is to start the broker asynchronously, but only wait for its starting up if it is the master (i.e. non-slave).
    
    Closes / fixes issue #6601.
    
    Credit goes to @lichtin for coming up with the solution.
