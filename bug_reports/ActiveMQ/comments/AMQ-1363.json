[I tried both on a windows and a linux machine, and the debug logging seems to work ok.

Though I did disabled the specific threshold being used by the console logger, so it will use the general threshold, specified at the start. Not sure, if this was the cause why you weren't seeing any debug info. :), Hmm. This is from a trunk build of ActiveMQ right? Strange it doesn't work for me.

Could you post an example log4j.properties file with debug enabled? (I didn't get the bit about thresholds). I tried a specific category for debug logging, or changing INFO -> DEBUG on the root - and no joy at all. Am totally stumped
, Yeah. I just did an svn update.

The previous log4j.properties has a:

log4j.appender.stdout.threshold=INFO

which limits the threshold for the stdout appender to INFO. Even though, the root logger is set to DEBUG. I've modified the log4j.properties file in the assembly module to not use it. Here's the complete config:

log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, stdout, out
log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.spring=WARN
log4j.logger.org.springframework=WARN
log4j.logger.org.apache.xbean.spring=WARN

# When debugging or reporting problems to the ActiveMQ team,
# comment out the above lines and uncomment the next.

#log4j.rootLogger=DEBUG, out, stdout

# Or for more fine grained debug logging uncomment one of these
#log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq=DEBUG
#log4j.logger.org.apache.camel=DEBUG



#The logging properties used during tests..
# CONSOLE appender not used by default
log4j.appender.stdout=org.apache.log4j.ConsoleAppender
log4j.appender.stdout.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.stdout.layout.ConversionPattern=%-5p %-30.30c{1} - %m%n
#log4j.appender.stdout.threshold=INFO

# File appender
log4j.appender.out=org.apache.log4j.RollingFileAppender
log4j.appender.out.file=${activemq.base}/data/activemq.log
log4j.appender.out.maxFileSize=1024KB
log4j.appender.out.maxBackupIndex=5
log4j.appender.out.append=true
log4j.appender.out.layout=org.apache.log4j.PatternLayout
log4j.appender.out.layout.ConversionPattern=%d [%-15.15t] %-5p %-30.30c{1} - %m%n, Ooops. It converted the # to bulleted numbers.

Alternatively, maybe you could also try setting the system property to the log4j properties explicitly like -Dlog4j.configuration=<path to log4j properties file>. Not sure if it will help though.]
