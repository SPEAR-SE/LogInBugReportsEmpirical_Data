[Are you using a custom uuid on AMQ that uses + signs in the id?

The old web console is deprecated in favor of the new hawtio console from 5.9 onwards. You can try using that to browse/view your messages. , Can you provide example code that creates a message with one of those IDs?, I put a plus in my hostname for now to do the trick., Fixed.  Added url-encoding of the message view and delete links using <c:url>.]
