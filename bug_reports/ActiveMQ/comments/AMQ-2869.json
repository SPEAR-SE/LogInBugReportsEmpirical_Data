[Fixed with svn revision 985198, I'm not an ActiveMQ Java developer, but I can see how the fix put in place will resolve the problem.  However, I did a quick code search, and I came across the call to toURL() in the file ClassLoaderSPIConnectionFactory.java (lines 60 and 67).  Do these calls also need the toURI() pre-treatment added?, Hi Jim,

this class is part ofnthe performance test plugin (which is on its own ready for an update), so it's not part of the distribution and shouldn't affect this issue.

Cheers]
