[Need more information here, are you saying that the Perl client is failing?  Have you check the broker logs to see what the broker is saying, is the broker configured to have enough memory to handle such large messages etc?  Can't help without more info. , Yes the perl producer fails  to send the message. I've checked the logs and broker does not report anything amiss. Is there a special configuration for message size too? We have configured the system usage and heap limits to have pretty large values., You could try turning on debug logging on the broker but you might want to also look into the perl client's code for debugging options., From what I can tell this is a client issue.  Would need additional information and test cases to determine anything additional on this.]
