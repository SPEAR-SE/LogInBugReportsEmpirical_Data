[Do you have a test case?
Have you tried moving to a newer broker version?  At this point 5.6 is pretty ancient.  , I don't have the simple test case. This is not consistent and seen when we do our server upgrade process which might be causing bunch of messages to published to its subscribers. We can move to latest version but our product is in final stages for release. We might update to latest version only for next release of our product. Can you help with any workaround  to avoid concurrent modification exception., We have moved to 5.8. We didn't faced any issues as of now.
