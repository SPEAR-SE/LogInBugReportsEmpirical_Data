[This probably is not visisble to most activemq developers as they might have the jar in their local repo., Works fine here, artifacts resolve out of the Apache SNAPSHOT repo.  Perhaps you should examine you maven settings. , Try to compile with skipTests=true and not with maven.test.skip=true the jar has <type>test-jar</type>, I do not have any special maven settings but I found that the activemq parent pom does not include a repository entry for apache snapshot.
Do you have that in your local maven settings?

I just found the problem... I ran the build using mvn clean install -Dmaven.test.skip=true as I had some test failures.
I now run the build using mvn -Dtest=false -DfailIfNoTests=false clean install like described in the building part of the wiki and it works.

Sorry about the wrong issue .. but perhaps it helps someone else :-)
