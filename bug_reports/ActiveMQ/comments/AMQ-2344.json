[To configure how a client connects, add the parameters to the brokerURI on the client network connector or connection factory. I think the fix for https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2283 may be necessary though to allow the parameters to be applied.

The discoveryUri has a limited number of parameters on the broadcast side but these should be respected. things like the keepAlive and timeToLive, full details in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/discovery/multicast/MulticastDiscoveryAgent.java, I found my problem and tested the solution keppAliveInterval=<n> after reading the MulticastDiscoveryAgent soruce.
With the following configuration the multicast packages are reduced massively (keepAliveInterval default is DEFAULT_IDLE_TIME = 500)..

<transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616" discoveryUri="multicast://default?keepAliveInterval=5000"/>

(The default value can be a problem with some smart switches not supporting IGMP snooping).

IMHO this issue can be closed.
