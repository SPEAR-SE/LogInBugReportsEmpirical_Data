[As discussed with James on irc, we are going to try the Multithreaded Requestor from lingo.  It seems that creating an unbounded number of  connections and/or temporary queues, is something that activemq doesn't handle well, even when clients are closing resources properly.  This could be related to long lived servers, but my understanding of JMS is that temporary queues should by garbage collected when the connection is closed. 

It might be good to deprecate o.a.bean.Requestor.  Its not great for performance, and also needlessly ties your app to ActiveMQ when  other alternatives are available.

But I'm OK with you guys closing this issue.  I can see we are being bad JMS citizens.  , Using the MultiplexingRequestor from lingo seems to have stabilised memory usage.  It hasn't gotten above 17MB yet (started at 14MB).

Performance seems better, but no concrete figures to back it up.  But it wouldn't be unexpected. , This is now fixed - we can handle many many producers being created & closed]
