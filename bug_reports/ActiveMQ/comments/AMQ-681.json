[Also, it would be nice to be able to configure separate encoding defaults for each channel, for example, to allow clients to send messages loosely encoded but receive messages tightly encoded., There is no historical tight encoding since 4.0 is the first release where openwire gets used.  The wire negocation rule is, always start with loose encoding and version 1 of the protocol with all extra options off.

Loose encoding is much simpler to implement than the tight encoding.  That is way it was choosen to be the default.  With all the options off + loose encoding, it makes it much simpler to implement a simple openwire client.  The initial WireFormatInfo then allows the client to switch on any number of options incuding the tightEncoding.]
