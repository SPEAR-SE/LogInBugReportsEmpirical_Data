Not sure yet if we still need asynchronous recovery - but the original issue should be resolved, Could you confirm that the original issue is fixed now in 4.1?, Tested in ebbeded broker (JBoss 4.0.4.GA) with 20K+ (10k+ size each) messages in Queue on startup. 2 Subscribers and 1 producer Connected on startup.
