[Dejan, can you take a look at the supplied patch and see if its in order?, Patch applied with svn revision 1239540.

It already discovered one typo in the features file.

Thanks!, Hi

it seems that this issue still exists with activemq-karaf version 5.9.0. See the following WARN message:

org.apache.karaf.features.core - 3.0.0 | Old style feature file without namespace found (URI: mvn:org.apache.activemq/activemq-karaf/5.9.0/xml/features). This format is deprecated and support for it will soon be removed

Could be removed, e.g. via:

{code}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<features name="..." xmlns="http://karaf.apache.org/xmlns/features/v1.2.0">
...
</features>
{code}]
