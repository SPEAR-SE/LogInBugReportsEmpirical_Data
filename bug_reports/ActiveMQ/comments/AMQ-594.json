[Temporarily excludes the SimpleNetworkTest so that build process won't hang, Seems that the test is hanging because the remote broker is trying to send a ShutdownInfo to the local broker after the fact that the local broker has been stopped. I've attached a patch that would not use failover when the forwarding bridge is sending a shutdown info. I'm not sure though if this is a good approach., Assigning to Rob for technical review. :)]
