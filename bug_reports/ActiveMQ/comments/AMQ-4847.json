[Would recommend that you try and reproduce your problem using the Java client and attach that test here., If you could help me out with an example code, doing an SSL certificate authenticated persistent queue consumer with a selector, I will try it happily.
BTW, you ask this because you want to know whether OpenWire works the same, or this is a STOMP related issue?]
