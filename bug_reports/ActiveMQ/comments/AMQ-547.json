[totalEqueueCount are just the amount of messages that have been enqueued; its not the total number of pending messages.

I'm a little unsure about the 140 connections; the connections do get de-registered from JMX when the connection closes. Could it be your application is creating connections and not closing them?

If you can definitely reproduce the ability to create and close a connection and its JMX MBean does not get unregistered let us know and we can reopen this issue - but in all the testing I've done, closing a connection certainly does remove the connection mbean]
