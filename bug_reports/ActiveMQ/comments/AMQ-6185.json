[It seems to be actually a bug of InactivityMonitor.
In fact, specifically for Http transport, the inactivity monitor skips all the wire format information. 
In this case the connection checker task is never canceled and this causes the connector to be stopped after 30 seconds because the monitor thinks that the connection has never been established.

In order to not wait for the issue to be fixed, you can overcome the problem by turning off connection checker (that does not make sense for http transport). Read and write checks for keep alive will by the way work as designed.

Just add connectAttemptTimeout=0 to your transport options (also in network connectors)
