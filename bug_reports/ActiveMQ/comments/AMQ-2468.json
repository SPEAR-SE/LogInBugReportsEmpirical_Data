[resolved in r831258.
pagedInPendingDispatch is now limited to maxPageSize.  Now we bypass dispatch for jmx queue modifications like purge and remove matching messages so they are not limited by pending messages and can page through all available messages. 
Note: consumers with sparse selectors may now need to increase maxPageSize as ever increasing pagedInPendingDispatch was exceeding that limit in error]
