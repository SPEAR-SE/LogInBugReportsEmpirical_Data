[TextWireFormat.patch fixes this issue. The data is written out in UTF8, which has the same size wire format as that previously created by writeUTF, and is preceded by a 4 byte length. There is an extra copy of the data created on both sending and receiving sides, but then again, it works., The patch submitted did in fact "work", but only for restricted message content: ascii characters.

Somewhat embarrassed,
Eddie, Turns out there is another bug: the HTTP connector is completely broken for multi-byte UTF-8 characters. The attached patch file includes fixes for both the 64K limit (same fix as previously submitted) and for the bad decode of the Http request body., Fixed by SVN revision 906049]
