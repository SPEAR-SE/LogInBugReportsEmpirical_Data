[I am wondering if the reproduction of this is not equal to the original error? What I mean is, is a true broker failure testable as a broker shutdown?, I recall an issue resolution that made 5.3 w.r.t the timing of bridge shutdown events. It would be interesting to know it this issue persists with 5.3.0 and if so a stack trace of the InvalidClientIDException would be most useful. thx., No test case provided and reported version is very old.  A test case to run against a current broker would be required if this is still an issue, ]
