[hi, 

I [reported the same|https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3660] two days ago. 

Your solution looks smooth, yet it apparently [causes problems on IE6|http://stackoverflow.com/questions/2023255/node-normalize-crashes-in-ie6]. Maybe we can find a workaround? (or let's just ignore IE6, I don't care ;) )

Claudio, Oh, I thought I'm the only one who is affected by this issue :)
I don't care about IE6, don't even have a dev machine to test, so I'll just ignore it

Anton, btw, found another solution, but it needs activemq source code change (i think)
the solution would be to return XML document with message tags wrapped with CDATA sections, Duplicate of AMQ-3660]
