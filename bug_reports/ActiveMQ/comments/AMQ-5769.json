[I tested this with JDK 1.8.0_45, Windows 7, and Activemq 5.9.0.  I followed the exact steps as described but my broker started up correctly and I could not reproduce the issue.  Can you post more information such as the console output or the full stack trace that you received?, Could not reproduce this with the information given.  Try using a current release and if the problem still occurs please provide us with enough information to reproduce what you did.  ]
