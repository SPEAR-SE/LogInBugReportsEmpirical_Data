[You can use the attached (rudimentary) Test class to test this case. , The test case creates a TopicPublisher without an assigned destination, in which case there is no advisory message sent because the broker doesn't know what destination that producer will publish on.  If you assign it a Destination you will get the advisory.  The same is true for a standard producer, if you remove the destination from the createProducer call in the test it won't get an advisory message either., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
