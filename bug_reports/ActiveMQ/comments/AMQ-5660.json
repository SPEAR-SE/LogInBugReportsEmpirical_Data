[Because of the nature of topics (being a broadcast) dequeue count is a little tricky.  For example, how many times do you count a message consumed by multiple subscribers?  Once after they all have consumed it (and what if one subscriber drops before acking the message)?  Once per subscriber (leading to dequeue growing faster than enqueue)?

And what about counting dequeue on non-durable subscriptions?  For inflight messages or only acked messages?  Messages published to a Topic with no consumers?

In other words, the meaning of dequeue on a Topic itself is hard to nail down, and even if it were nailed down, it would be hard to use reliably.  Also keep in mind that ActiveMQ does not store messages on Topics, but instead stores them on the subscriptions.

Therefore, I find the best method of watching enqueue and dequeue counts for Topics is looking at individual subscriptions., Same issue being reported as AMQ-4965, Hi Arthur Naseef / Timothy Bish 

I had many subscribers on my topic.
One of them was not consuming the messages because it seemed to be crawling - Even though this particular subscriber did not show up as offline in the "subscribers" tab.
The subscribers in my application are expected to be durable ones.
I restarted the subscriber which was crawling and apparently the dequeue counter grow up faster and as you said the messages on this subscriber was consumed. This resolved the bottleneck.
Thanks for giving me the various scenarios to be considered to debug the issues around dequeue count for topic subscribers.
If i face any issues on any other usecase scenario, i will raise a new requeust.
We appreciate the quick feedback.
Thanks everyone.
