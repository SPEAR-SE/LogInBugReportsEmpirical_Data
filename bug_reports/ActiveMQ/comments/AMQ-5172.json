[Would need a test case to reproduce the issue so we can investigate. , Tim,

I don't have a particular test case for this but in my broker setup, I usually saw this behavior:

> When I run broker for long time (~20 days) and then restart it without clearing kahaDB.
> If I clear the kahaDB, I see every mbean is getting registered and working properly. 

Thanks,
