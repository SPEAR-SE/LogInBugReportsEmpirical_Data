[it seems the retry operation will need to lock down dispatch to the DLQ till it completes. This case shows that it can accept a message while an ack (and rollback of the audit) is pending., Commit 2ea5d1420bbbf90bd151e19a75e6ca33c773f1f4 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6847] pause dispatch for message move to avoid redelivery with pending ack/remove/audit rollback
, [~alvinkwekel@gmail.com] Thanks for the test - I was able to easily integrate into a unit test to validate. Having the receiving queue pause while the move is in progress sorts this issue., Great work [~gtully]. Thanks for the fix!, Will this be backported to a 5.14.x maintenance release?
I'm asking since this is a blocking issue for us and upgrading would require some serious impact analysis.

BTW I'm following this bug up for the client [~alvinkwekel@gmail.com] reported this for
, This can be backported to 5.15.x for sure but there's not really any plans right now to do another 5.14.x release.  (this could change if enough people want a new release) Is it possible to upgrade to 5.15.x? (this requires Java 8).  

[~gtully] - Looks like this test broke on the latest run in CI: https://builds.apache.org/view/A/view/ActiveMQ/job/ActiveMQ-Java8/lastBuild/org.apache.activemq$activemq-unit-tests/testReport/org.apache.activemq.broker.virtual/VirtualTopicsAndDurableSubsTest/testMoveFromDLQImmediateDLQ/

It works for me locally though so maybe just need to tweak something , Commit 03b19b9da4d50c3bb8985f930e93596c7d994d26 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6847] limit the retry loop to one iteration overa all pending messages such that new additions are not replayed to avoid duplicates
, [~cshannon] sorted that failure, it reproduced locally in a loop. It exposed another problem with retry where new additions would be retried twice leading do duplicate send suppression., Since there is now a [5.14.6|https://issues.apache.org/jira/projects/AMQ/versions/12340366] maintenance release planned; can I vote for this bug to be included in it?, Commit eb9e50f3c9ea9de4777a6c6295ff8065aa3b4252 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~gtully]
