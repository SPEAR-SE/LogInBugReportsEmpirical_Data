[I'm seeing a similar issue with Apache Derby: http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Connecting-to-the-Apache-Derby-database-being-used-by-ActiveMQ-td3243546.html.

I'm using 5.4.2., DefaultDatabaseLocker use this sql to get an  exclusive lock:
select .... for update.

so it's correct for Oracle, derby also support for-update syntax, see http://db.apache.org/derby/docs/dev/ref/  select segment.
so I think it's well with derby.

notice that it's INFO, not WARN or ERROR.

if DefaultDatabaseLocker can't get a locker, it will report it, sleep a while and retry.
, This looks fixed in 5.6]
