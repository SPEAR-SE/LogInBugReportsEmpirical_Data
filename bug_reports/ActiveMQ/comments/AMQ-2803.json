[https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2542 will address this by implementing duplicate suppression at the transport when a failover occurs. This will ensure that the store does not get duplicates in the normal failover case.
, As an alternative, I've tried the same test using the {{<amqPersistenceAdapter>}} instead, with the configuration below. 

{code:xml}
		<persistenceAdapter>
			<!-- <kahaDB directory="${activemq-broker.dataDirectory}" /> -->
			<amqPersistenceAdapter directory="${activemq-broker.dataDirectory}" syncOnWrite="true" maxFileLength="32mb"/>
		</persistenceAdapter>
{code}

Using this adapter instead of KahaDB, I find that I don't get the warning message. However, I *do* get the same 'zombie' messages in JMX: the queueSize suggests that there are messages to be delivered (for example, in two failover tests I ended up with a JMX {{QueueSize}} of '3' and '1' respectively after failover), when in fact all messages were delivered successfully. Nicely, the {{<amqPersistenceAdapter>}} is better behaved in that if I restart the broker then the {{QueueSize}} is reported correctly again. , Thanks Gary for the note. 

Any idea when the fix for AMQ-2542 will go live? Is it currently on trunk at Apache? , I am working on it atm, so should have some completion by the end of the week. Any tests you can provide to validate will be appreciated... there a a bunch of tests that assert duplicate suppression and ordering but non that tie it together with the queue sizes  and jmx.
You can access the brokerview and pull out the relevant stats from junit test if u want to verify them., Cool. I'll see if I can put together a unit test for this - alternatively, get in touch with me off-line and I can give you a non-Junit test-case.
