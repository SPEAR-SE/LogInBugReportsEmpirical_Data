[Can you try the latest snapshot

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.5-SNAPSHOT/

(or even 5.4.1 release)

it should be fixed since 5.4.0 release., Marking this resolved as theirs no test to help reproduce and the scheduler has had a number of fixes that should have addressed these problems.  Feel free to reopen if you still see this issue.]
