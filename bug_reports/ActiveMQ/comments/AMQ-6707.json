[I think the issue is that the callbacks can be be invoked twice on recovery. 
I have been writing more tests for xa completion with the jdbc store under various error conditions. This has resulted in a few different fixes related to recovery and message dispatch stalling post recovery due to the cursor and store being out fo sync. I recall seeing a similar stack trace during test and fix development., Commit ea70e827c049cee9d455303a8cdb31a64b23763d in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
