[This appears still (also?) not to work in 5.12.0. Unless my expectations are wrong.  

When I kill a consumer process the producer process still throws "javax.jms.InvalidDestinationException: Cannot publish to a deleted Destination: temp-queue://ID:garyhodgson-PC-50108-1483473568352-1:1:1"

In the activemq config I have set the following attributes on the broker tag: cacheTempDestinations="true" timeBeforePurgeTempDestinations="20000"]
