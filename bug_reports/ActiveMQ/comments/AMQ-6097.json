[I did some debugging and the problem is that in certain cases, the wrong marshaller is being used for the messages keys in the message order index.  During updates in KahaDB the size is being read as -1 and not initialized since the used marshaller doesn't know how to serialize the message size.  Normally the location index is used for size information so this problem doesn't always show up., Commit 246ccb8e04515c6e85544b32035537f60d92b5b9 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Fixing KahaDB so that the correct marshaller is used for the message
keys inside of the message order index.  This will ensure that message
size metrics are accurate.

Fixing JournalCorruptionEofIndexRecoveryTest class

Because of the size being stored in the message order index, the test
testRecoveryAftercorruptionCheckSumExistingIndex was no longer passing
as that test was corrupting the size value in the journal, but not the
size value in the index.  The test now corrupts both values so that the
expect exception occurs again.
