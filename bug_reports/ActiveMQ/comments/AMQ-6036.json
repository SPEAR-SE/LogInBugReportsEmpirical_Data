, Is there anything more I can do to get this merged?, Sorry for the delay, the patch looks pretty good to me.  The only thing missing is the apache license headers.  Can you add those to your new files and also rebase against master?, PR has been updated - added headers, rebased, and fixed one more corner case in the parser (oh, those REs...)., Commit 278d29dadc9bc92971d35e9433caeabb347323b9 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~pdudits]

Slight refactoring to make the WildcardFinder class use a static method
so that we don't have to allocate throw away objects that will
immediately be garbage collected.
