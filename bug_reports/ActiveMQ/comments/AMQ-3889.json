[Testcase to reproduce issue., Resolves this issue., Fix applied in trunk with thanks. , Hi,  I see the same issue.  What should I do to get the patch, please let me know the details.

-Sathish, ActiveMQ 5.7.0 is undergoing the release process now.  You can wait a few days for that or grab one of the nightly SNAPSHOT builds., Thanks for your quick response.    My aim to create a external tool using JMX that will monitor few ActiveMQ Queues periodically and peek(browse) into certain non-well formed messages and raise alerts.

Few questions, if you can answer, will help me a lot.
1) Is there a workaround available for this?  
2) Is this an issue with activeMQ JMX agent service?  The upcoming patch to be applied to activeMQ service?
3) I guess even though the browse shows message with null characters(after couple of browsing on the same message), read message actually fetches the message properly, please confirm if this is correct.  

Thanks
Sathish]
