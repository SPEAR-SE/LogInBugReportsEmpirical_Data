[The test code attached is very helpful, thank you.

In the code, sessions, consumers, and producers are being created in a message loop, so that every message gets a new session.  This is very bad, although it shouldn't lead to missing messages as described.

Running this program on my system, the client and broker both ramped up to about 30-40% cpu usage.  And message flow was terribly slow.

Another concern - there is no comparison of messages sent and received.  To detect missing messages, are you only looking at counts?, Attaching modified version of the client that takes the session, producer, and consumer creation outside the message-processing loop.  It also limits consumption on each client to it's portion of the produced messages and allows the program to terminate properly once all consumption and production is complete., Please give the ActiveMQClient2.java a try in your environment.  Note that I replaced JNDI with inline instantiation of objects as I'm not using JNDI.

If this does not work for you, we'll have to look at other factors that may be involved., and if you get something that reproduces, please validate against a 5.10-SNAPSHOT to see if the issue exists on trunk. thx, Reducing this to 'major' since its against an older broker release and we have no test case to check against the latest release or SNAPSHOT builds. ]
