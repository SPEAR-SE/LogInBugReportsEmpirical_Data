[Kind of surprised this is still an issue (as of 5.1 snapshot Jan 16, 2008).  How does any unit / regression test for the discard policies work?

Anyway, I've had this fixed since 4.2 (march 2007) by commenting out updates to prefetchExtension in the acknowledge method in TopicSubscription.java.  However, I'm not sure the exact reason why this value is updated - to me it is a static value, but what was the reason for modifying it?
, Sorry - should have included this in the previous comment.  5.1 code also seems to be setting the DispatchedQueueSize to -(DiscardedCount).  This makes the problem worse, as the queue depth now has to grow up through this negative value, too.
