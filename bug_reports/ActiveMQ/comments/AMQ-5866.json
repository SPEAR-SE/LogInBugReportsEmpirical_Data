[Also affects CAMEL-8911 so probably affects all pages as well., Yes, sample codes are definitely missing in every web page of activemq.apache.org site.
, Looks like this issue has been resolved.

Daniel Kulp was looking into this via a Camel User Forum thread:

http://camel.465427.n5.nabble.com/Camel-website-is-not-showing-the-code-blocks-td5768644.html#a5768690, Pages look good now. , It's only resolved partially. XML codes are still now showing:

http://camel.apache.org/zeromq.html

I know that's a Camel page, but I think the underlying engine is the same.]
