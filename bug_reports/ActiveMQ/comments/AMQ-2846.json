[Initial indications seem to suggest this might work.

<bean id="jmsFactory" class="org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory">
		<property name="brokerURL">
			<value>failover://(tcp://localhost:61616)</value>
		</property>	
		<property name="useRetroactiveConsumer">
			<value> true </value>
		</property>	
	</bean>


Still it would be better (IMO) that this be able to use as suggested above as a parameter.
