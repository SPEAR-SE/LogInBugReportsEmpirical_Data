[I have a unit test but its based on Pax-Exam and loads JBoss A-MQ 6.0 directly. Will try to find out if I can write a more generic unit test.
, Attaching a possible fix for this bug in AMQ-5304.patch.
Will still try to also come up with a unit test that can be incorporated into the source tree.
, Added the test (ignored for now) with the following commit

https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=acf84b43

The patch also looks good to me.

, Fixed in commit [ec2a3c750bbfb33763ac56b8b0a660bdf8542145|https://fisheye6.atlassian.com/changelog/activemq-git?cs=ec2a3c750bbfb33763ac56b8b0a660bdf8542145].]
