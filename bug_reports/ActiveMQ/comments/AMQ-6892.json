    [AMQ-6892]: Test failing unexpectedly: CamelVMTransportRoutingTest.testSendReceiveWithCamelRouteIntercepting

    When I run the test CamelVMTransportRoutingTest.testSendReceiveWithCamelRouteIntercepting, it passes, but when I run all of the tests in activemq-camel, it fails. I am running this in Intellij.
    
    It appears the problem is unclosed connections in some of the other tests.
