I believe the behavior you describe complies with the JMS specification. It may be a bit surprising but if you read the javadoc for the setJMSPriority method is states "JMS providers set this field when a message is sent". I.e. it is not intended for the application code, but the message producer.

The application can either, as you mentioned, set the default priority for the producer. Alternatively when the application needs to adjust the level per message, you can use one of the MessageProducer.send() methods that takes a message priority as an argument.

I'll close this issue, but I'm not a activemq commiter, so feel free to reopen this issue again if you feel that my interpretation is invalid or not sufficient for you.]
