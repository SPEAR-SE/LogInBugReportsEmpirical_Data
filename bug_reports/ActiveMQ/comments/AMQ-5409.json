[Struggling with problem with same symptoms, successfuly reproduced the problem with the testcase. 
Re-attaching testcase packed nicely into maven project, with enabled logging to just unpack and execute.
 , this is by design. onMessage and prefetch=0 are not friends. why do you need prefetch 0 and not 1?, In my usecase i do use the queue to distribute the work across the cluster. There is low amount of messages that take long time to process. So i want them to be processed in maximum paraleism. So i do not want individual consumers to cache message while processing other one (prefetch=1) from queue as this causes other threads to lack for work., I think you have another option, use a client transaction (so  a transacted session) and use destination policy entry usePrefetchExtension=false on the broker for the destination in question. In this way you can have a prefetch of 1, and only one message will get dispatched till the consuming transaction commits.
With the default usePrefetchExtension=true, when the first message is delivered to the consumer another gets queued up., This option suits our needs, I close the JIRA]
