[Default broker redelivery policy is not configurable through the xbean configuration of policies (though it could be a nice enhancement). You can adapt redelivery policy on the consumer side, by setting it on a connection, connection factory or a consumer (if you need per-destination funcionality). Take a look at http://activemq.apache.org/redelivery-policy.html for more info, Isn't the doc specifying that you can do this?

http://activemq.apache.org/xbean-xml-reference-50.html#XBeanXMLReference5.0-redeliveryPolicyelement

, That's the reference document I initially found, so I was surprised to get the error after following the example.

It would be a great feature to have if it means I don't have to remind every consumer writer about the need to specify the redelivery policy., Can I get this ticket re-opened, or an update?

It looks like there's a disagreement between what ActiveMQ is or is not supposed to do.

Either way, I'd like the ability to specify redelivery policies from an ActiveMQ configuration.
