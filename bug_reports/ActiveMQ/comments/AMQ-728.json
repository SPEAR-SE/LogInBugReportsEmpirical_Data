[Hans,

Could you try setting up activemq to use the c3p0 http://sourceforge.net/projects/c3p0 datasource instead of the commons datasource?
We have had reports that it works much better.  Could you confirm?

, Hi Hiram

Thanks four your help. We will test this in a test environment. I will keep you updated.

regards, Hans, I think this is now resolved - if it isn't please let us know and we can reopen]
