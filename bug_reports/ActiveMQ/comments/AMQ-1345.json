[This patch removes it from the interface, avoiding exceptions like 'Could not instantiate bean class [org.apache.activemq.ra.MessageResourceAdapter]: Specified class is an interface', I saw this recently when using a custom built ActiveMQ (5.0.0.9-fuse) with ServiceMix (3.2.1)., Patch applied in svn revision 646789]
