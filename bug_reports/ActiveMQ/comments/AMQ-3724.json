[Unit test for complex clustering JMX tests., Broker B & C do not have their network connectors mbeans available, Because the brokers are all running inside the same JVM you need to call setCreateConnector(false) for brokers B and C so that they don't stop the management context and restart it.  Otherwise they clobber the names in the MBeanServer.

   getBroker(BROKER_B_NAME).getManagementContext().setCreateConnector(false);

, Thank Tim.  

That cleaned it up.  I will upload another patch with the changes.  If someone feels the unit tests are still valid feel free to apply them.

Thanks,
