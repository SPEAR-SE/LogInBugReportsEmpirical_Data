[For comparison I am adding a thread dump of a container that is operating as expected. 

We were unable to spot a (the) diffirence. , [~andreasgies] hope all is well :-)

One thought is to check the memory limits - shared and per destination to ensure there is memory available to page in the messages if they are not in the cursor.
Also - possibly enable selective trace logging and check for differences in behaviour.
Ultimately a heap dump would be the way to see the state of the queue that is not dispatching to see where the messages are. , Hi Gary, 

thanks - everything is fine as usual. Guess whatt app we are doing ;) - I see you are still in AMQ land .... 

I will pass on the request for a heap dump as this to be taken from production and update the ticket a.s.a.p.
I will dig into the memory limits - any suggestions what I should be tracing ? - Should I see something in the logs if the limits are insufficient ?


Thanks for the quick answer - I know I am doing something stupid here 
Andreas, I have provided the heapdumps of two affected containers here:

The size of the heap dumps was just too big to attach to JIRA. I hope that way of sharing is ok.
