[BTW, on *clean 5.11.0* installation, with sample route deployed, if I send 1 message into inbound, I see counters 1 for both out queues, but if I try to browse - there is nothing., Enqueued/Dequeued counters for inbound queue are always zero.

Note that there is no producers for it also on web console (only one on Connections page)., I can also reproduce OutOfMemory when trying to browse (should be empty) queue from web console in case described., No test case submitted to allow this to be reproduced.  , What? No test case? Did you ever tried to run supplied camel route?, No any activyty for 2 years, no questions, and when just close? Are you kidding? I have provided camel route, and in my case its enough to reproduce this issue in 100% cases. Did you ever tried it?, I am also a little bit surprised that this issues was closed, because we have the same problems by using JMX and Hawtio/Jolokia: We receive wrong information about queues and messages. It would be nice to know, if this can be fixed or not, or how it can be done. Perhaps it would be better to throw exceptions instead of returning wrong information?, The issue is still causing problems for me. It would be really helpful to fix this behaviour. Any plans to improve the situation?]
