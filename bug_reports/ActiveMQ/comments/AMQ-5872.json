[Would first suggest trying the latest 5.12-SNAPSHOT and see if your issue is resolved.  If not a test case would be needed that can reproduce this so we can track down what it going on.  , Hey, thanks for responding this quickly! We will try the 5.12 snapshot.

If it does not work, I will try working on a test case, but I am not a java developer, so maybe you can point me in the right direction?

Cheers!, There are a number of tests in the activemq-mqtt module that you can work from.

, I played around with this a little and I couldn't reproduce this using the exact same steps as described. So I tried a few things and I was able to get the null pointer after restarting the broker and then switching the topic to a wildcard on the new consumer.  I uploaded my test case as an attachment and if it is run the same exception is printed as described in this ticket.

A null pointer check can always be added but I'm not sure what the underlying issue is yet that causes this.
, Updated test so that it does not use fixed ports, they cause havoc if used in CI., Updated the code to account for the fact that there may not be a message reference value for the last ack location marker as that is always the next to use value.  , Hey, thanks to both of you for figuring out our problem.

We have succesfully installed v5.12 snapshot on our development environment, and our issue is resolved!

I will close the issue, but I have one more question: do you have any ETA on the 5.12 final release? Because we don't want to use a development snapshot in our production environment.

Kind regards,
Mathia, Snapshot build fixed our problem in DEV, still need to wait for final release for PRD., I don't have an exact date but I believe the plan is to try and wrap up 5.12 soon.  A good amount of work has already gone into it.]
