[AMQ-3725 feature is better suited to the jdbc store which is internally consistent.
Kahadb is tolerant to a single write failure., If the broker needs to stay up, for sync traffic AMQ-6606 helps ensure the journal does not get corrupt batches.
KahaDBIOExceptionHandler allow this sort of behaviour by resetting kahadb after the first error. , Commit c5a8b2c8b11121f4999d9f05932cd040d8c9f2a7 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6625] ensure kahadb stops operation on the first IOException to facilitate auto recovery from partial writes
, Prior to the handIOException up-call the journal and index pause. The appender write thread won't get recreated and the index is marked unloaded.
This ensures that subsequent writes will fail allowing auto recovery from a partial write to kick in on restart.
The DefaultIOExceptionHandler implements a resume call on kahadb that allows the stopStartConnectors behaviour or ignore all errors behaviour to be chosen if necessary., The KahaDbIOExceptionHandler clashes with the use of the LeaseLockerIOExceptionHandler - need to push the allowIOResumption support into the persistence adapter., Commit b07821ab6494b43e1ae8877eaf740effc7896b84 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

[AMQ-6625] remove kahadbioexceptionhandler by pushing allowIOResumption into persistence adapter. This allows the lease locker to still be used with kahadb for stopStartConnectors support
