, Fixed this bug here: https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/140, Could anyone accept pull request? 6 months passed since it was open., One issue with this patch is it breaks backwards compatibility.  Because you got rid of getContentType(request), users who were specifying type with a request parameter would now break.  See http://activemq.apache.org/rest.html

There is an example on that page: {{wget --user admin --password admin http://localhost:8161/api/message/TEST?type=queue\&clientId=A\&json=true}} that would possibly not work since the json=true would no longer be checked.

Another issue is that request.getContentType() is supposed to be used to specify the content of the request, not to specify what the response type is.  The accept header is what should be used instead to specify what the response type is.

That being said, your point about the content type being set in the wrong spot is correct and should be called before response.getWriter()., Commit f888cc2729832c6c71f0da9b5586d731e7a41648 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~davsclaus]
