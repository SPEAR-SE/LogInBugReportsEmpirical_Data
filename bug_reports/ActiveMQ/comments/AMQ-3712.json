[https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3655, Would be useful if you can create a junit test that reproduces the issue. , Try with 5.6.0 or the upcoming 5.7 release. There has been many fixes since.

Also when you see negative numbers in the web-console. Can you see the same negative values from JMX (eg using jconsole etc.)?, same effect with activemq 5.7: if there are pending messages stored on disk, and broker was restarted, TotalMessageCount (jmx) is zero, You might be seeing this where the enqueue/message count is a time-based counter (from when the broker started), whereas QueueSize on a particular queue takes into account the store regardless of time:
