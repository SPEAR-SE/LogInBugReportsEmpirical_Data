[Are there any other IOExceptions in the log? My guess is the PageFile not loaded error is the result of another error.

The PageFile would typically only become unloaded if the store was closed or if there was another IOException error.  Since this happened during the checkpoint tasks that tells me that the store was open so my guess is some other IOException occurred during pagefile write which triggered KahaDB to detect the error and unload the PageFile.

Also, there was some improvements done to the PageFile IOException detection in 5.15.0 in this Jira AMQ-6625, No further feedback provided and not means of reproducing given to aid in investigation.  Using newest version is recommended.  ]
