[Attaching junit test., Patch attached., resolved in r935954

policyEntry.usePrefetchExtension allows the prefetch extension behaviur to be disabled. When false, and with prefetch of 1 or X, a new message will only be dispatched when the message is acked, rather than when it is delivered. When false, a client ack consumer  or transacted consumer will only ever get prefetch (X) number messages. 

code example of it disabled from the test:
{code}
        PolicyMap policyMap = new PolicyMap();
        PolicyEntry defaultEntry = new PolicyEntry();
        // ensure prefetch is exact. only delivery next when current is acked
        defaultEntry.setUsePrefetchExtension(false);
        policyMap.setDefaultEntry(defaultEntry);
        broker.setDestinationPolicy(policyMap);{code}]
