[I've added a patch to Usage class. All (3) synchronized statments in method declarations were removed. In start and stop they are not necessary, because those methods are guarded by atomic booleans. getExecutor() needs more care, but I would prefere lock on usageMutex, because in order to prevent deadlocks, you need as little mutexes as possible. Also mutex is used only on executor initialisation. If it's already initialized, no locks are made., patch applied in r734256 with thanks.]
