[I'm reopening this issue because of the following making it hard to tell that any change was made to address the issue raised:

* the patch provided is not applied
* there are no comments in the ticket to explain how it was fixed

Please help anyone reading this ticket to understand what was done and why it is marked as "fixed"., My mistake - the patch was applied, with edits, on commit 04c6d9dd69402038d78104f1cc48c22e30edfddc.

I was looking at a branch rather than the trunk; closing now.

Apologies for any confusion.]
