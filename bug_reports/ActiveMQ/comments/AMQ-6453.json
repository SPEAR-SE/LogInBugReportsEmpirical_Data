[Original user mailing list thread with considerably more detail: http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/ActiveMQ-ReplicatedLevelDB-corruption-td4716831.html, I think it might be the same issue as https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5618  (which is still open after 21 months)  or https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6174  
I'm using version 5.13.4, and had the similar issue: after fail over several times, I got the error "No reader available for position" or "Invalid log position: 0 "
I suggest adding some warning on the related doc page,   "ReplicatedLevelDB is not ready for production use". 


, Yes the documentation needs to be updated.  At this point only KahaDB really gets any support and I would consider LevelDB essentially deprecated as there doesn't seem to be anyone who wants to maintain it and to try and fix some of these issues., LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
