    This fix adds the table-prefix to the activemq_acks_pkey. This is because for postgresql if we use table-prefix statement than Indexes are also created using table-prefix. This table-prefix is empty-string if table-prefix is not used so shouldn't affect normal scenario when table-prefix is not used.

, there is a setter for acksPkName on the PostgresqlJDBCAdapter so you can configure around this issue.

<bean id="postgresPersistenceAdapter" class="org.apache.activemq.store.jdbc.adapter.PostgresqlJDBCAdapter" >
<property name="acksPkName" value="local_activemq_acks_pkey"/>
</bean>
