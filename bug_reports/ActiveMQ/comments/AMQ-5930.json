[Support questions belong on the ActiveMQ Users Mailing list., what?, Jira tickets are for reporting bugs or new issues, not for asking for help.  If you want help with something (like configuration) you should email the users mailing list. Here is how you can post to it: http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html
