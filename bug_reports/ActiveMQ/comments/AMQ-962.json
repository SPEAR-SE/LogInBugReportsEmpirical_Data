[I encountered a similar problem when using the PooledConnectionFactory, which is currently intended for sending messages only. In my case, it was caused by a concurrency issue when the session is closed and messages are still processed by the consumer. The PooledSession does not halt the underlying session's executor, so that messages are still delivered when the session is about to close. These messages might in your case be read, but not acknowledged.
, I think this should now be fixed. Let us konw if you can still reproduce it]
