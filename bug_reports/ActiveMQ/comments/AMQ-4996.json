[Is there something kicking in an the broker side that's causing a delay, such as GC or other high CPU tasks.  That would explain a pause that results in this error. , No high CPU tasks at that time. The system is sizing to cope with processing 10s of transactions per second but we're seeing this error even at very quiet times (one transaction every 20-30 seconds) - ie producing a message every 20-30 seconds.

I didn't actually check the GC but there's very little going on so it's highly unlikely that GC is causing such a long delay. Looking at my logs I can see that around that time the average time we spent on a transaction (excluding message production) is under 200ms with nothing at all above over 1.2s - if GC was causing a pause I'd expect to see that impacting those timings as well.
, During the 5 seconds between the start of the send and the receipt of the timeout, the broker log is showing me that background things are happening. For example, I got a timeout at 05:08:48 (send started at 05:05:43) and the log looks like this:

Any insight would be helpful!
Thanks, No test case to reproduce this and the version is quite old so you would need to move to a supported version such as v5.9.1]
