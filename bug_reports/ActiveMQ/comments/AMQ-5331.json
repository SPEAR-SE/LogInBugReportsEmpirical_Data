[Looks like similar problem for  issue 5338 I just opened. I also use the  Authentication plugin. And our environment works well in the version 5.5.1 and run into OOM problem after upgraded to 5.10, You can easily check you have the same problem if you use jvisualvm and look how many org.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQTempQueue exist.
, This bug can be fixed by removing org.apache.activemq.security.SecurityContext.authorizedReadDests and org.apache.activemq.security.SecurityContext.authorizedWriteDests and all references on it, since this data seems not to be used for anything.

Or you simply change the code to not aggregate temp queues in this fields, e.g.:
        // PATCH do not add temp queues since it produces a memory leak
        if (!destination.isTemporary()) {
        	securityContext.getAuthorizedReadDests().put(destination, destination);
        }

In our production environment with a network of brokers setup the problem occurs after 3 to 4 weeks. Actually, it manifests in constantly rising CPU and HEAP utilization. The Broker dies with weird behavior even before an OutOfMemoryError even occurs., Have you try SimpleAuthenticationPlugin? My configuration use SimpleAuthenticationPlugin instead of JaasAuthenticationPlugin, Seems to happen for every AuthenticationPlugin since org.apache.activemq.security.SecurityContext.authorizedReadDests and org.apache.activemq.security.SecurityContext.authorizedWriteDests is used by all this authentication plugins.]
