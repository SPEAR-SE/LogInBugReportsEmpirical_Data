[Have you tried using a profiler to see where the time is being spent on the stomp+nio+ssl case vs the others, perhaps that will shed some light on things.  , I'd recommend looking at the STOMP unit tests and trying to construct a little performance measuring test we can use to track this down.  , Found the trouble spot and fixed it, should fix issues across all protocols with their NIO+SSL performance. ]
