[Would helpful if you could distill this into a JUnit test, as there's a lot of code in this sample., Timothy, I am not sure if I understand you correctly. It is all stripped down to a JUnit test already. There is one single JUnit test class. This is JmsQueueIssueTest.java. This class has only one test method. 

All this was part of a big application and it took me one hour to distill this one JUnit test. 

Please be more precise and tell me what you want or need., The sample uses a large amount of code from main that wraps the JMS API and makes it difficult to determine if the issue is related to the wrapper code or to ActiveMQ.  A clean JMS Junit test would make it easier to determine if the issue is in the broker code or not., O.k. understood. Please give me some time. I may not be able to deliver your requested, cleaned unit test before next week., Closing until a test case that is available that can be used to validate the issue.]
