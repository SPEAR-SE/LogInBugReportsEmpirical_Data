[the problem is the org.apache.activemq.security.AuthorizationBroker, it adds destination to the security context on addProducer/addConsumer but when these destinations are gc'ed they are not removed from the connection context.
With a long lived connection, these can accumulate.

securityContext.getAuthorizedReadDests().put(info.getDestination(), info.getDestination());

the fix is probably in org.apache.activemq.security.AuthorizationBroker#removeDestination, where we need to remove the destination from the auth map of all connections.

org.apache.activemq.security.SimpleAuthenticationPluginTest would be a simple place to add a test case, once the gcInactive is added to org/apache/activemq/security/simple-auth-broker.xml

creating producers/consumers to USERS.1-1000 and having them gced and checking jvm stack usage should expose the problem in a unit test., unit test - fix is not trivial. will take a bit of work., Fix and test added on trunk.]
