[Hi Keneida, could you contribute a junit test case.. that would help use get going with this faster., I dont have any  test case yet. the way I discovered it was by using Springframework DefaultMessageListenerContainer which gets connection from org.springframework.jms.connection.SingleConnectionFactory (targetconnectionfactory is  org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory)
The DMLS is a durable one with durableSubscriptionName set and clientid is set on targetConnectionFactory.
--edit--
in activemq.xml I have:  <fixedCountSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy maximumSize="5" />
--edit--
I start my application, it receives the message without any problems.
The problem is when I restart the app - the message is received again., No test case provided, need some more info or a test case to reproduce this issue]
