[Is the real problem with MSSQL too? I know that {{relaxAutoCommit=true}} JDBC URL parameter is known "workaround" on MySQL and it is described in [jdbc-support|http://activemq.apache.org/jdbc-support.html]. Isn't only a typo mistake (MSSQL instead of MySQL)?, Yes, it is MySQL. I made a typo when mentioning the AMQ-577 (resolved by adding a MSSQL JDBC URL parameter) issue. So I am confirming that this has nothing to do with the MSSQL database., This is resolved with the fixes in AMQ-5318]
