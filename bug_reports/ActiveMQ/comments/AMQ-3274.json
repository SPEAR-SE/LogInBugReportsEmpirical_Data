[Patch eliminating duplicates on temporary topics.  As the patch shows, subscriptions to temporary destinations were being matched against the subscriptions in permanent regions, not the temp regions., JUnit test which demonstrates the duplicates. Uses an "echo" service and tests Topics, Queues, Temporary Topics, and Temporary Queues., This is a relatively small change to fix the problem and I have provided a JUnit test case.  Is there anything more I can do to help resolve it?

Note that I just checked the sources on the head (snapshot taken 01/12/2012), and the problem remains there., Fixed by SVN revision 1326502]
