Should these commits be backported to 5.13.4? (I'm assuming so because you marked this as 5.13.4 for the fix version)  I ask because the current 5.13.x branch doesn't build right now.  Looks like there is a compilation error from a missing method in the JmsClientTestSupport class that was added in one of these commits., Yes, it can go back, originally wanted to let the CI tests runs check it and forgot to merge it back later., Alright, I'll merge the fixes., Commit 508c12d9487ad653f05806be7a492e4bd870522b in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~tabish121]
