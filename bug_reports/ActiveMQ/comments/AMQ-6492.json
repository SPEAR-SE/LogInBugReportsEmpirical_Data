[This really isn't an ActiveMQ issue as that class is used only in Camel, so you should take this to Camel as an issue., Have created bug for Camel: CAMEL-10432, Fixed in CAMEL-8994. It appears that current versions of ActiveMQ (e.g. v5.14.0) use Camel v2.16.3 which includes this. Subsequent versions switched to the Java 8 rewrite which allocates lazily based on contention, rather than upfront, which should further avoid this type of problem., master branch uses latest Camel]
