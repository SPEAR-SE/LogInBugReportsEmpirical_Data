[refer to http://docs.codehaus.org/display/ACTIVEMQ/Web+Samples. Pleas  add a comment when it's fixed., Some urls in the web pages still had "jms" instead of "amq". Fixed these.

Generated war file doesn't include web files (javascript files, web.xml, etc), Added "maven.war.src" property. Web files are now included in the war file]
