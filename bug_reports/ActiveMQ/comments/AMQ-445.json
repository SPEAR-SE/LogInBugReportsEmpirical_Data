[The STOMP protocol actually states that all white space after the frame terminator but before the next command should be ignored., No it doesn't.  

If you disagree, please attach any relevant language from the STOMP 1.0 protocol at http://stomp.codehaus.org/Protocol that backs up this claim., See the BNF in the Stomp 1.0 spec.
