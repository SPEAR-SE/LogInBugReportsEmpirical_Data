[Broker1 conf, Configuration and setup, This should depend to the fact that you have a prefetch on the queue and on the conduit on the network connector.
By default this prefetch is set to 1000 messages. This is coherent with the figures in the attachment (queue burst). 
I suggest to close the ticket since it is not really an issue but normal for the way AMQ is designed.
Please try to play with flow control or different prefetch values more adapted to your use case]
