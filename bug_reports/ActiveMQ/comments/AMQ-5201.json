[RedHat support concludes that the underlying STOMP-library doesn't support prefetch, so the client will only accept a certain number of messages until the underlying buffers fills up. That explains why this only happens when using STOMP.

The pending limit strategies discussed in the [docs|http://activemq.apache.org/slow-consumer-handling.html] is not applicable to this scenario since the prefetchLimit isn't reached. The solution for the problem is either to use {{AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy}} or set an explicit prefetch on the destination in question.

I guess this task boils down to *"Better error handling for consumers that doesn't support prefetch and cause broker memory to fill up*. I can't see that the messages are persisted to temporaryStore or persistentStore either, but that needs confirmation.]
