[Would this be of any use for your case: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5672, It sure looks like it would be, thanks!  Apart from adding the cleanup period, etc, in AMQ-5672, might that work also include being able to explicitly blacklist certain selectors?  The fix for this scenario, in my mind, would be to have something in place that would allow me to tell ActiveMQ to never cache a wildcard selector against the destination - but I could see it being useful for arbitrary selectors as well., Yes! i think blacklisting or excluding selectors (specific ones, or even "turn wildcards off") would be reasonable configuration. , With that, then, I'd say it would definitely address this issue.  Much appreciated!, k! let me add that to the patch. and still doing some testing at a customer to make sure everything else is kosher... can commit when it all looks good, but will add the exclusion piece. thanks!, K so i'll close this one as duplicate. there was another issue that needed to get out of the way first (see https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5672 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5689)  I'll also add the exclusion settings when i commit for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5672. 

Thanks!, Duplicated by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5672]
