[Tracked this one down a bit.  Turns out the issue is that I was getting a double FailoverTransport decorator for each broker connection.  This appears to be due to my NetworkConnector list looking like this: 

static://(failover:tcp://host2:61617,failover:tcp://host3:61617)

If I change the url list to:

static://(tcp://host2:61617,tcp://host3:61617)

the problem goes away.  The FailoverTransport is still used, which is desirable.  However, it seems strange that it is a "hidden" decorator now.  Did you really intend for this to happen?, Good catch; the static: and failover: are quite similar really and one or the other should be used. I've tried to fix the documentation to make this absolutely clear...

in particular I've added your issue as a big read warning on that page so hopefully others won't make the same mistake :)]
