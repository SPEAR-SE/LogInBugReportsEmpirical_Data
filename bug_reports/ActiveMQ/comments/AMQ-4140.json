[Gave the patch a quick spin, the unit test fails on my Linux platform, you should try this out on a Non-Windows machine and see what other issues might exist.  , My apologies for not having double-checked this case earlier. 
I have re-uploaded a new version tested under:
- Linux
- Windows

and which passes the unit tests and the attached user acceptance tests, under both the two OS:

- multi-module build (maven-activemq-plugin-client-multimodule),
- single/simple module (maven-activemq-plugin-client-simple)., Patch applied with thanks., Thanks Timothy!, Attached {{5.7.0}} patched, with a modified POM which plays well with the rest of the {{5.7.0}} modules, in case some people want to deploy them to their repo using:
{code}mvn deploy:deploy-file -DpomFile=pom.xml -Dfile=maven-activemq-plugin-5.7.0-patched.jar -DgroupId=org.apache.activemq.tooling -DartifactId=maven-activemq-plugin -Dversion=5.7.0-patched -Dpackaging=jar -DrepositoryId=My-Release-Repo -Durl=http://host:port/nexus/content/repositories/releases{code}]
