    [AMQ-6544] Create spring.schemas with schemas of activemq and spring

    As spring is embedded now we also need to define the spring schema mappings to make them available when being offline. Downside is that this needs to be maintained. So the better way would be to join the files from activemq-spring and spring. 
    Does anyone know how to do this?
