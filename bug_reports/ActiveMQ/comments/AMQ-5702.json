[Any interest in this or should I just give up and go use another library?, Hi!

Have you tried the solution given at documentation (https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/REST) ?

On your GitHub code you set 

If strMethod = "POST" Then
  objWinHttp.SetRequestHeader "Content-type", _
    "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
 End If

on the Wiki this issue is addressed by setting the header as:

"Content-Type: text/plain"
