[would it be possible to simplify your load test and still be able to reproduce this observation?

After a restart, when there are 2,3,26 messages, is it possible to consume these messages?
If so, they would be considered duplicates from the application perspective, correct?

The reason I ask is to determine if the problem is related to skipped messages or destination counters.

The key to getting to the bottom of this is some test code or a description that can reproduce, and ideally reliably.
