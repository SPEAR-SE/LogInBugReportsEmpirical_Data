[Fixed (? or at least improved) a race condition in both test cases which occurred intermittently on slower machines.
  , Updated to include the save fix for the testReceivedMessageStillInflight test.
, Still seeing failures on my old Mac, Updated the test to wait for acks to finish after receiving the 7th message.  This should eliminate the race condition the tests were hitting before., Thanks, passing now repeatedly on my old mac. ]
