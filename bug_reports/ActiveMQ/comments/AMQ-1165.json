[Has anyone had a chance to look at this?  This is a blocking issue for release of Geronimo 1.2 due to TCK certification..., That logic was put in place as a "Feature"..  In rev 511463 in 4.1 trunk I have now made that "Feature" optional so that we don't break JMS compliance., also fixed in trunk rev 511464, I think you forgot to commit the test case., Your right.. corrected in rev 512102 and 512104]
