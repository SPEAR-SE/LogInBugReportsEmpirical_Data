[This is expected behavior. The protection against CSRF attacks is implemented to make sure you're calling an action from the web application (and not hitting URLs directly). When you hit "back" button, the browser will pull the page from the cache and it will not be properly initialized. Try reloading "queues" page before hitting "delete" and it will work.

, Working as designed, I guess this is what just happened to me, though I inially associate the problem with AMQ-2886. The error page could do with being far more specific. Even when I looked up the coresponding log entry I didn't see what "Possible CSRF" had to do with how I got to the page I clicked the link on.
