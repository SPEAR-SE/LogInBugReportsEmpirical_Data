[fix in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/3fdf9861

An empty topic in the store did a partial cleanup of index resources but there remained some stale references in the metadata. It is properly cleaned up now. Also an MBean was left dangling when a sub was removed.

Thanks to pat fox for the nice test :-)]
