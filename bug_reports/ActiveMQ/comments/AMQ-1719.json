[Ooops! Should be WebSphere 6.1.0.11, We are getting a similar exception thrown occasionally during our stress tests. Exception happens on start up of some of our consumers. I am working on some reproduction code now but stack trace looks like this:

We are using AMQ5.1, Jencks 2.1 on Windows XP SP2, Sun JDK1.6.03
, The NullPointerException occurs at the last line of the 'run()' method of RemoveTransactionAction:

\\
{code:title=ConnectionStateTracker.java|borderStyle=solid}

    private class RemoveTransactionAction implements Runnable {
        private final TransactionInfo info;   

        public RemoveTransactionAction(TransactionInfo info) {
            this.info = info;
        }

        public void run() {
            ConnectionId connectionId = info.getConnectionId();
            ConnectionState cs = connectionStates.get(connectionId);
            cs.removeTransactionState(info.getTransactionId());
        }
    }
{code}

Apparently there is no ConnectionState for "connectionId" (anymore).

"removeTransactionState" removes the TransactionState identified by "transactionId" from a local Map, but since ConnectionState does not exist anymore, this is bogus.

The NullPointerException itself is not a problem, but can be avoided by putting an 

   "if (cs != null) {...}"

around the last statement.

The problem probably existed already.

, I looked in the latest code, and added a fix for the potential NPE.]
