[have you tried to reproduce with a 5.3-SNAPSHOT?, I just downloaded the latest 5.3-SNAPSHOT dated Mon Aug 17 18:51:55 GMT+00:00 2009 and I can repro the deadlock., Have you tried with the nio transport?, Yes, but only in 5.2. Unfortunately I can't get the NIO transport to work at all, doing anything. I haven't had time yet to track down if I have misconfigured it or something. I have a task to investigate the NIO transport further and log a bug if I can't get that working either., Fixed by SVN revision 811425]
