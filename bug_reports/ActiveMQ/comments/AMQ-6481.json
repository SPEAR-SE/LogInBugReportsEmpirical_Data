[Were the destinations created after you configured the policy?  Looking at your configuration, it should apply to new destinations and disable the flow control flag but it won't apply to any existing destinations that were created before disabling the flag in your policy.  Also you can try the latest 5.14.x version as well to see if that makes any difference.

If you are still having an issue it would be a good idea to try and write a test case/junit test to demonstrate an issue if it exists., Thanks for your reply, I have deleted kahaDB and recreated the destinations with producer flow control configuration. Still same result. I dont see any JIRA related to this in 5.14.x.
