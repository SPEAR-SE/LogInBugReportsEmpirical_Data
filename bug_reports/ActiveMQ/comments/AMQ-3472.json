[no test to reproduce , A workaround in 5.7 is to replace the following line in method "purge" of class "org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue"
-        this.destinationStatistics.getMessages().setCount(0);
+        this.destinationStatistics.getMessages().setCount(this.destinationStatistics.getInflight().getCount());
AMQ-4598 included in ActiveMQ 5.8 probably has a real fix.
