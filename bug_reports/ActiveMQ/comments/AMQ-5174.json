[is there any timeline that the activeMQ 5.11.0 released?   it is fixing some bugs in 5.10.0,  so I am expecting a released version to download.
Thanks, If the instanceof dependency is changed to org.apache.activemq.broker.LockableServiceSupport that may suffice.

Maybe add LeaseLockerIOExceptionHandler that will work with any store that implements LockableServiceSupport and deprecate the JDBCIOExceptionHandler, GitHub user PaulGale opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/53

    Fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5174 

    - Cannot use the `JDBCIOExceptionHandler` when `KahaDB` is configured to use a `lease-database-locker`.
