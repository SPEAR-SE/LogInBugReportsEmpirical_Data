[increasing the audit capacity; policyEntry maxProducersToAudit=200 ensures the cursor audit tracks up to 200 producers and traps the duplicate from the store. In addition, disabling concurrentStoreAndDispatch avoids the issue.

The root cause is enabling the cursor cache when there are pending sends leaving a possible scenario where a sync send is lost behind sufficient async sends that fill the cache. Reverting to the store in this case results in duplicates., Commit a0ba0bf4c6beaf50ce5e021ef5e4d493119bb1ef in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
