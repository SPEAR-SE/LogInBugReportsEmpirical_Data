[The error is happening because there is an active consumer on one of the destinations being emptied out.  You should not be calling empty() on a destination that is in used.  We should add logic so that an exception is thrown from the empty() call if the destination is in use.

I'll keep this open till the error check is implemented., Error check it snow implemented.]
