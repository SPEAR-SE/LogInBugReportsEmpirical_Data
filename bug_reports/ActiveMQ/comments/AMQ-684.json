[In SVN head theres a test case for multiple Queue consumers: JmsQueueSendReceiveMultipleConsumersTest.java in org.apache.activemq test packages of activemq-core.
Could you add some more infomation about how the broker(s) and clients are setup ?, JNDI set:java.naming.provider.url = tcp://128.64.7.27:61616?connectionTimeout=30000&soTimeout=20000

Message is PERSISTENT.
And not wait to sending and reciving.
It will well run 5 minute,but after a long time ,sending will be blocked.




, This bug have not repaired.

This bug is too bad.That cann't send message one queue when it have more than one jms message reciving client.

After as so run period of time,the sending will be blocked. My jms client alway transfer send and recive methord., You can continuously send and recive messag in a queue.Sending one million message. to test., I think this was resolved against 4.0, please retest against that version.  If the problem still exists, please reopen.  Attaching a test case to the issue usually help the developers find the problem quicker.]
