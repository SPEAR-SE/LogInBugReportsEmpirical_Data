[I have the identical problem but this to add to it, in the web server directory it works fine.

I can either say

java -cp .;.\activemq-core-5.1.0.jar;.\javaee.jar;.\commons-logging-1.1.jar Heartbeat

or just say

java -jar Heartbeat.jar

this jar has Class-Path: activemq-core-5.1.0.jar javaee.jar commons-logging-1.1

works fine here but NOT as a web applet we get the same error, A post on a related problem suggested using the newer commons-logging-1.1.1.jar

I got the new one and made the change in my compile and my manifest and applet tag

That seems to get me further but still an exception, now this one top line only

javax.jms.JMSException: Could not connect to broker URL: tcp://192.168.1.50:61616. Reason: java.security.AccessControlException: access denied (java.util.PropertyPermission org.apache.activemq.UseDedicatedTaskRunner read)

or the full stack

, I think that is because applets run on a security sandbox. To allow them to create threads, make connections, etc., you'll need to sing them with a certificate. When the user loads the applet into the browser he/she will be ask to accept the certificate. Then the applet will connect.
It's just a thought., '@ Manuel Garcia: Thats right.

I'm using ActiveMQ 5.3 in my applets and it works. The same exception happens the I forget to sign my jars. When I sign then every thing work just fine.

I think we can close this issue., Issue relates to not using sign java applets.]
