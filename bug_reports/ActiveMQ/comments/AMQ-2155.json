[Note that there two consumers initially connected, denoted by port - 55213, 55218. 
They process a number of messages, until 15:03:01,555 when 55305 connects/subscribes followed by 55309 then 55312, 55315,55318, 55324, etc.

NO messages are processed by any of the new consumers until the queue empties at 15:06:34.

A new batch of messages is queued at 15:20:13; this new set is distributed among the waiting consumers.
, This is affecting a production environment now.
, This appears to be related to the activemq.prefetchSize. Messages are also being dispatched out of order.

With the default prefetchSize (set to 1000 if the online docs are correct), using the code provided in this report, I do the following:
1) Clear the queues
2) Start one consumer
3) Queue 200 messages, 1 second delay (TestModel(200,1) in the example)
4) Start the 2nd consumer
5)  --- I observe that the 2nd consumer sees NO messages while the first consumer continues to process messages. EXPECTED BEHAVIOR: 2nd consumer should see messages
6) Queue 50 messages, 2 second delay(TestModel(50,2) in the example)
7) --- I observe that the 1st consumer is working on the original set of messages. The 2nd consumer starts to process the newly-queued 2-second messages- processing the Messages out of order. It only processes 1/2 of the messages that were queued (this 1/2 ratio of processed to queued was observed repeated for various #'s of queued messages
8) When the 2nd consumer stops, queue 4 messages of 3 second delay 
9) Observe that the 2nd consumer processes 2 of the 3 second delay messages, then stops. Also observe that consumer #1 is still processing 1 second messages: A listing of the messages in the queue shows gaps in the message sequences where messages have been removed and processed.

10) Observe that Consumer 1 eventually processes the remaining 2 second and 3 second messages.




 , Tried various pre-fetch sizes.

prefetchsize of zero - NO messages delivered to initial or subsequent connecting consumers.

prefetchsize of 1 - subsequently connecting consumers get messages immediately, no issues with out of order messages.

, We're working around this issue by limiting prefetch, using client_ack, and restarting the broker periodically.
