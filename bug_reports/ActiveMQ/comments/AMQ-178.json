[Hi Michael

Any feedback on this one yet? Any ideas on how to reproduce?
, Hey Michael - is this still an issue? With all the fixes lately, I'm hoping its resolved now?, Hi James,

I'm not sure if it's been fixed or not.  I haven't had a chance to recreate this lately since it requires a serious load test to duplicate.  I was never able to trace down the source of the problem, but if no one else is reporting it, then there is a good chance that it has been resolved., Lets close this out for now until this verification that this is still an issue or we get a test case that shows the failure.]
