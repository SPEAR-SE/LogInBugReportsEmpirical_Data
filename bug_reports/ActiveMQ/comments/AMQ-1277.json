[The maven bug reference: http://jira.codehaus.org/browse/MNG-2339, Please note that Maven 2.0.6 does not work either, so Maven 2.0.4 is required to deploy correctly. The bug is expected to be fixed in Maven 2.0.8. , Sorry this was my misunderstanding. Maven 2.0.5+ deliberately does not interpolate properties in the deployed poms. The maven bug referenced above is for something else.]
