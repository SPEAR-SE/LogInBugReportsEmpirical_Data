[activemq.xml, This log was created when reproducing the bug in dev environment, with cache none, a new consumer is created for each receive, leaving no consumer for some duration. When there is no consumer, topic messages are dropped.
Use a durable consumer or CACHE_CONSUMER, with a single consumer with default prefetch, it makes sense to cache it., There are 2 issues here:
1.
When configuring org.springframework.jms.listener.DefaultMessageListenerContainer with cache none, a new consumer is created for each receive, leaving no consumer for some duration. When there is no consumer, topic messages are dropped.
Using CACHE_CONSUMER solves this issue.

2.
