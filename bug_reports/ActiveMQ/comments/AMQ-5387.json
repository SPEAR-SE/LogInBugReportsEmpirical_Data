[Reseting of the readSize was incorrect.  It was using the payLoadRead which could span buffers.. In the case it did.. it would result in a bad state in the codec object, and the following frame would be bad (mis aligned) , It's simpler if you just attach the test case as a file instead of a large comment block.  , will do.. 
Thx
Curt, Fixed on trunk., Thank you [~cjutzi] I was trying to figure out same issue !]
