[I believe this is part of what is going [here|http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/master-slave-within-a-network-of-brokers-td4410862.html] and in my own [post|http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/in-master-slave-broker-network-networked-slave-incorrectly-bound-to-other-slave-tt4658858.html]

I think having the incorrect slave connection results in these messages, taken from that first post:

, patch which resolves this issue.  i don't see a grant license mechanism, but i hereby grant license to my uploaded patch., Need some unit tests to validate this., Okay.  Can you point me to a master/slave test and to a broker network test that I can use as templates to try to reproduce this in the activemq test env?, There's tests in org.apache.activemq.network in activemq-core, This is no longer an issue as we don't support pure master / slave any longer.  ]
