Updating patch to make sure SelectorAwareVirtualTopics are covered
and code cleanup

, Patch applied with thanks to Chad Zobrisky., We have some brokers (5.11.1) configured with {{prefix="\*.\*."}}.  After the upgrade to 5.13.3, I believe the change to shouldDispatch(...) is failing the destination name check, and the result is that messages are not being dispatched to the virtual topics.

A naive (but working) option would be to change the shouldDispatch(...) from:

bq. {{return prefix.contains(".\*") ? ...}}

to:

bq. {{return prefix.contains(".\*") && !prefix.startsWith("\*") ? ...}}

Which should satisfy both objectives: the original objective of AMQ-6058, and the need to support virtual topics whose prefix starts with a wildcard.]
