[Any updates here ? I have also verified that these files are opened by ActiveMQ broker even after deletion. [lsof +D /path_of_levelDB]. This is a serious issue because we have lot of messages going thorough persistence store and it will fill up the storage. 

Please take a look. 

Thanks,
Anuj, Please take a look guys. It's affecting the production environment. , Am facing similar issue, can somebody from activemq developer help on this?

Thanks,
--bansalp, ActiveMQ Gods,

Can you please take look. Lot of other people are also facing this issue, I found https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4684 where the same issue was reported. 

At-least give us some response. 

Thanks,
Anuj, It's been 15 days and not even a single response from vendors. It's very disappointing to see no one cares about the issues here., If you want faster help then look at the companies that offer commercial support. 
http://activemq.apache.org/support, Are you using the Java baed LevelDB implementation or the JNI driver?, HI,

I am using Java based Leveldb implementation. 

As I can see : "org.iq80.leveldb.impl.Iq80DBFactory" as an indexFactory and 
logs says that : "[20141119 14:24:38.293 IST (main) org.apache.activemq.leveldb.util.Log$class#info 93 INFO] - Using the pure java LevelDB implementation."

I am using the default leveldb configuration, i just removed "pax-url-aether-1.5.2.jar" to run broker with leveldb. 

Thanks,
Anuj, Any updates. Will this be fixed in ActiveMQv5.11 ? , Hi, 

I also see this problem in ActiveMQ 5.11.1., Looks to be the same issue and has been resolved. ]
