[The problem here is that when KahaDBPersistenceAdapter.doStart() is called the code registers an MBean, but when doStop() is called we don't unregister it.

I'm not sure this is the right way to fix this, or if it would have been better to add an unregisterMBean method to AnnotatedMBean.  If the latter is better let me know and I can submit another patch.
, Patch seems fine except that it needs to check is JMX is enabled in the if statement. , Patch applied with fix for checking JMX state before trying to access the management context. ]
