[fixed in 687677

mods changes to fix: https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1866

problem was out of order message delivery. A full subscription that became available during a dispatch could receive messages newer than those stored in the pagedInPendingDispatch list. When the pagedInPendingDispatch is again dispatched, out of order messages can occur.
Changes to maintain the order of pagedInPendingDispatch were also needed.]
