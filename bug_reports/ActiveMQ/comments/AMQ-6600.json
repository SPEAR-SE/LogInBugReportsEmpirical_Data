[This is probably a configuration or environment issue and is better suited as a question posted on the user mailing list, see http://activemq.apache.org/mailing-lists.html

If you can show that there is a bug then this can be reopened., Such exception are very hard to reproduce... The root cause -- AMQ create separate thread for controling each of connection:
{code:java}
public abstract class TransportThreadSupport extends TransportSupport implements Runnable {
    private Thread runner;
    protected void doStart() throws Exception {
        runner = new Thread(null, this, "ActiveMQ Transport: " + toString(), stackSize);
{code}

In case of some problem with connection this thread try to set "closed" status for connection and some times it happens *after* the *close* method called on Session object from main thread.

Generally, such an exception means that connection is broken.]
