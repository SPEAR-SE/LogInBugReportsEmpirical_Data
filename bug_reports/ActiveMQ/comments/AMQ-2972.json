[I've managed to solve the issue by upgrading the jetty components to version 7.1.6
So, in lib/web, I updated jetty-all-server-7.0.1.v20091125.jar to jetty-all-server-7.1.6.v20100715.jar
and jetty-websocket-7.0.1.v20091125.jar to jetty-websocket-7.1.6.v20100715.jar.

Probably the websocket specification has changed between jetty releases.

Also, some extra documentation on how to use the client libraries specifically for ActiveMQ would be handy.
It took some time for me to find out that the destination should be in the form "/topic/test.topic" or "/queue/test.queue"., fixed with svn revision 1022029. Thanks for digging this out., Using apache-activemq-5.4.0-fuse-00-00

I tried updating the jetty jars and got:

ERROR: java.lang.RuntimeException: Failed to execute start task. Reason: org.springframework.beans.factory.BeanDefinitionStoreException: Failed to load type: org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService. Reason: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService; nested exception is java.lang.ClassNotFoundException: org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService

I tried adding jetty-security-7.1.6.v20100715.jar but that didn't help., The jetty-all-server jar is an aggregate jar that contains org.eclipse.jetty.security.HashLoginService. Maybe your classpath is non-standard or there's a difference between ActiveMQ 5.4.1 and Fuse 5.4.0?]
