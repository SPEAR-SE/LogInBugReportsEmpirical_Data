AMQ-7001 - ensure cursor pending cached id list is pruned of futures that end in an exception, fix and test
, The change here needs to be reverted and an alternate solution found.Â  The current change causes message bodies to be garbled for certain types and the conversion back to AMQP fails leads to dropped messages for some AMQP receivers, Commit 9ec6ee43b146736fdf635090b2829a0c621a00f3 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

AMQ-7001 Resolve issues with encode failures on copied messages

Ensure that messages are copied to avoid contention on message content
when concurrent store and dispatch is enabled and better handle the AMQP
message type value.  Adds an AMQP Encoder for UTF8Buffer to encode down
to AMQP String encodings to allow for encoded OpenWire messages such as
MapMessage which can contain UTF8Buffer instances for String keys and
values., Commit ad0ae74f3b432f96aba17957bbb6dca0e0bdf8f5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~tabish121]

AMQ-7001 Remove now unnecessary check for UTF8Buffer type

Remove the now unneeded checks for UTF8Buffer on the outbound converter
as the Codec now can encode those to the correct string AMQP types
