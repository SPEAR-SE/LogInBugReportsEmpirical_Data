[I think setJournalMaxWriteBatchSize is what you want. looks like this is a bug in the documentation. let me know it setJournalMaxWriteBatchSize works for you, Sorry, this does not work - same type of exceptions.

{code}
 <kahaDB directory="/srv/activemq/work/data" 
    setJournalMaxWriteBatchSize="32mb" 
    enableJournalDiskSyncs="false"
    journalMaxFileLength="32mb" 
    indexWriteBatchSize="10000" 
    indexCacheSize="1000"/>
{code}, The error should be a little different, about a conversion or type must be an int rather than a string. That attribute does not have the property conversion on it, that can also be fixed. currently the value needs to be a plain int, 32000 rather than Xmb
See: http://activemq.apache.org/maven/5.3.1/activemq-core/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/KahaDBPersistenceAdapter.html#setJournalMaxWriteBatchSize(int) 

It needs the annotation like setJournalMaxFileLength
{code}/**
 * When set using Xbean, values of the form "20 Mb", "1024kb", and "1g" can be used
 * @org.apache.xbean.Property propertyEditor="org.apache.activemq.util.MemoryIntPropertyEditor"
 */{code}, This has since been resolved by other work on this class.]
