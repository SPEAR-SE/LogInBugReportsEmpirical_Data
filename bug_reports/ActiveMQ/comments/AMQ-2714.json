[Screen shot placed into the file, updated with  the xss screen shot.
screen shot file attached., I confirmed the problem in 5.3.x versions. However, it doesn't affect current 5.4-SNAPSHOT as the problem is in Jetty's error handler that doesn't escape the message (which is fixed in Jetty 7). Anyhow, I took this opportunity to implement custom 404 and 500 pages for the web console (which is also a workaround for this problem).

To work around this issues on existing 5.3.x installations: 

- download AMQ-2614.zip attached to this issue
- go to ${ACTIVEMQ_HOME}/webapp/admin
- unzip the archive

This workaround will be available in the next fuse 5.3.1-fuse-01-00 release (http://fusesource.com/), if anyone is interested., Hi Dejan,

Thanks for the prompt reply and fixing this issue.
I tested it on 5.4-SNAPSHOT and 5.3.x versions with workaround applied and seems the issue has been fixed.
