[does using the console mode, "./bin/activemq console"  help here?, console mode will help, but also the fix in https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3747, This issue isn't actually resolved. My 5.8.0 broker was failing to start because of a NullPointerException (my fault in the configuration), and the error didn't appear until I changed the ">/dev/null" to ">/opt/activemq/data/activemq.out"., I fully agree, this might be a real pain for debugging production problems.
Threaddumps can also be collected 

I suppressed all messages on STDOUT/STDERR in the implementation of the new init script because this logfile cannot be rotated by log4j.


I think it would be really useful to redirect STDOUT/STDERR to the activemq logfile.
As i can remember JBOSS also does this, probably the sourcecode might be useful for changing this.
Probably a redirected logger fails i.e in situations with memory problems - i don't know how jboss handles these types of problems.

Alternative way: 
 * Reconfigure log4j not to log regular log messages to STDOUT/STDERR
   (this logfile is not rotated, therefore only really essential/critical things should be logged in this file)
 * Modify sys-v init script to provide the possibility to log messages to a logfile specified in /etc/default/activemq or $HOME/.activemqrc
   (see appended patch)
