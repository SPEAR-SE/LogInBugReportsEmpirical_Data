[added an affected version, Fix added here: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=548260

Test case here: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/failover/FailoverUriTest.java?view=auto&rev=548260

Though it should be noted that errors within the transport list is ignored. i.e. failover:(tcp://localhost:61616?cheese=abc) will not be flagged as erroneous because the tcp part is configured during actual connection only. Any exceptions during connection in failover will result in the transport trying to reconnect. In this case unless the failover transport is configured to fail after n retries it will hang. I'm not sure if this is a serious bug or an expected side effect.

Let me know if it works for you Dileepan. Thanks! :)]
