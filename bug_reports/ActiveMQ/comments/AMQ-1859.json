[Can you test this one against 5.2.0. It should be fixed. Thanks, Dejan, Hello Dejan,

I've tested this with the 5.1, 5.2, and the Feb. 17, 2009 5.3 snapshot.
They all failed, but in slightly different ways.  I've modified the
QueueBrowserTest.java file to show this by changing the
testProducerBrowserConsumer() method as below.

Previously, the method verified that "Cleanup Receiver 1" did not see any
messages on the queue.  In 5.1 and 5.2 this test would fail.  In 5.3 it now
passes.  However, in all versions, the number of sent messages does not
equal the number received.  I have added this assertion to the test and it
fails across the board.


  public void testProducerBrowserConsumer() throws InterruptedException,
JMSException
  {
    int      count     = 1000;
    Producer producer1 = new Producer("Producer 1", count / 2);
    Producer producer2 = new Producer("Producer 2", count / 2);
    Browser  browser   = new Browser("Browser 1");
    Receiver receiver  = new Receiver("Receiver 1");

    browser.start();
    receiver.start();
    producer1.start();
    producer2.start();
    receiver.join();
    browser.finish();

    int received = receiver.getCount();

    System.out.println("Received " + received + " of " + count + ".");

    receiver  = new Receiver("Cleanup Receiver 1");
    receiver.start();
    receiver.join();

    assertEquals(0, receiver.getCount());
    assertEquals(count, received);
  }
