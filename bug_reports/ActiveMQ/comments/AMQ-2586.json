[Fixed in trunk in rev 904243, Would it be possible to backport this small fix to 5.3.1?  We're looking at upgrading from ActiveMQ 4.1 and we have monitoring that checks the broker's TotalMessageCount as an overall health check of the system.  We can check each queue, but the overall check is nice since any substantial backup across queues indicates a potential issue (in our application)., done. fix applied to 5.3 branch in r910942, update fixed version to 5.3.1 as fix merge to 5.3 branch]
