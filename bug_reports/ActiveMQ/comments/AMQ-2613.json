[Two issues:
- XSS
- XSRF/CSRF
, Fixed with svn revision 915384 and merged into 5.3 branch.

The web console should now be immune to XSS and CSRF attacks. First ones are fixed by sanitizing the output. The CSRF attacks are prevented by sending a secret to the form and checking it before modifying results. Also, POST method is forced where it is applicable.
, It looks like there are some new unpatched vunerabilities. Taking a release apache-activemq 5.3.1, installing it and navigating to :

http://localhost:8161/admin/connection.jsp?connectionID=%3Cscript%3Ealert%28%27XSS%27%29;%3C/script%3E

you see an non-permanent XSS vunerability

For a permanent XSS vunerability do the following:

1) On web console go to the 'send' page:

set:

    * destination : "foo"
    * correlation ID field to "<script>alert('Vunerable to XSS!');</script>"

2) go to the queue browser page page for queue "foo" - you get an XSS attack, Joe is correct.

Also, for the permanent XSS, "correlation ID" is not the only vulnerable variable. "Reply To ", "Type", etc. are vulnerable.

It is important to sanitise user input in general, not just for the variables that are being reported here., Fixed in svn revision 931552

Thanks for reporting this. I did some more sanitation and hopefully everything is covered now., Dejan,

I just checked on the latest 5.4 snapshot (Thu Apr 08 04:00:00).  The first issue is fixed, but the second one (sending a message with correlationID containing script) still occurs.

cheers,

James., Hi James,

I just tried to reproduce it, but it seems all fine from here. What are you seeing as a result?

Cheers,
Dejan, Dejan,

my mistake, activemq was picking up an old config file during my tests.  I confirm this now looks fixed.

I think you can close it now (again !)

thanks,

James., No worries James, I'm glad it's really fixed. Cheers]
