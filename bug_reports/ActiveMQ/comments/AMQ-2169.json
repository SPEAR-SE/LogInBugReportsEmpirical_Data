[I would love to get some movement on this!  I was using the web console to fix https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1112, scheduling for 5.3, scope of spring mvc beans was incorrect, should have been scope="request". Updated config to match changed in activemq-web-console. The duplication (which is not good) is the result of the broker config and properties files needing to be installation aware. Hense a distribution needs a separate file., small update. pulled the query beans into their own file and include via import so that the duplication is removed.]
