["NameNode provided as a query parameter is not validated in Apache Hadoop before 2.7.0."

2.7.0 does not exist in maven central :

[http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-core]

or maven cloudera :

[http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.hadoop/hadoop-core?repo=cloudera]

 , The hadoop library is only used for testing LevelDB:

./activemq-leveldb-store/src/test/scala/org/apache/activemq/leveldb/dfs/DFSLevelDBClient.scala
./activemq-leveldb-store/src/test/scala/org/apache/activemq/leveldb/dfs/DFSLevelDBStore.scala
./activemq-leveldb-store/src/test/scala/org/apache/activemq/leveldb/test/TestingHDFSServer.scala
./activemq-leveldb-store/src/test/scala/org/apache/activemq/leveldb/test/DFSLevelDBFastEnqueueTest.scala

The impact of using that library in a unit test is minimal - I'd suggest we could close this card as not-an-issue., Not so fast

  /activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:works with Hadoop based file systems to achieve HA of your stored messages.
./activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:**A:** An existing Hadoop 1.0.0 cluster
./activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:        <property name="dfsUrl" value="hdfs://hadoop-name-node"/> 
./activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:   Instead of using a 'dfsUrl' property you can instead also just load an existing Hadoop configuration file if it's available on your system, for example: 
./activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:     <property name="dfsConfig" value="/opt/hadoop-1.0.0/conf/core-site.xml"/> 
./activemq-leveldb-store/readme.md:**A:** It should be able to run with any Hadoop supported file system like CloudStore, S3, MapR, NFS, etc (Well at least in theory, I've only tested against HDFS).

Either remove the hadoop feature, or fix the vulnerability, /please/

 , LevelDB support has been deprecated and no longer recommended., Thanks Christopher !]
