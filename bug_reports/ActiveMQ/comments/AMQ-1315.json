[Path for the QueueBrowser Servlet.

* Uses the ConnectionFactory from the WebClient, but keeps it's own connection and session pool, since we don't want to depend on the session (would be bad if we got many requests)
* Fixes typo in the queues.jsp (Web-Console): feed=rss2.0 not ffeed
* Changed the links in the rss/atom for the messages. The trunk implementation will create a new queue with the name {queue}/{messageId}. I don't think that's the expected behavior, so I changed it to link to a xstream representation of the message. This could be improved, but I think we should define first what exactly we want to show before we butter any time into implementing it., The patch is a bit outdated (due to the refactories by Hiram and James). The patch attached to AMQ-1460 also fixes this issue, let me know if there's a need to have a separate patch for this issue. , Thanks again for this patch! Applied all I could - also refactored the QueueBrowseServlet to use WebClient as well. Wanna check I didn't miss anything? The code's changed a bit since the patch so it got a bit hairy comparing the diffs :)]
