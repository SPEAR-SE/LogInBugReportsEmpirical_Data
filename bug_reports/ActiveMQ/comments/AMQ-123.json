[Accidentally I commited this issue before I was finished.

Anyway, on the website it is said, that you can use cvsgrab to checkout stuff if you are behind a firewall.

But cvsgrab doesn't work with fisheye. So if people try it, it might waste quite a bit of their time. It would be good to remove this remark., I've updated the website...

and we now have tarball support on FishEye]
