[Affect also Trunk version of ActiveMQ, We have seen this twice in a standard 5.2.0 installation.
In both cases we saw a BadMagicException in Kaha, deleted the index-store-state file and then restarted.
, I am seeing this in the current trunk 'very' often, usually after a an unclean shutdown but also on a clean shutdown.

Is it related I wonder? Deleting store files by hand (and now currently written into code as a temp workaround) is the only way to get ActiveMQ to fire up., Think the recovery should be triggered, by deleting the whole "state" directory, not just the index file.

The KahaDB issue was not related and it's fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2935, Ok, did you update the documentation to say that? Otherwise I will contribute a patch (if documentation patches are possible)., Yes, fixed here https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/AMQ+Message+Store

It'll be available on the site on the next sync. Thanks!]
