The ack compaction task now acquires the checkpoint lock while it runs
to prevent a checkpoint from running at the same time unintentionally.
Also, getJournalLocation is now protected by a try/catch to handle
errors.
, This has been resolved.  In the future it may make sense to get rid of the checkpoint lock entirely and only run the tasks on the executor.  The existing points in the code that run the checkpoint as sync could just use a future and wait for it to finish, etc.  I think this would work ok without the lock but would still need to look closer at it and make sure no issues would pop up., We need to grab the readlock, not the writelock because the journal requires the readlock to store to it.  With the writelock everything grinds to a halt when rewriting acks which we don't want., Fixed updated with a readlock: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=c8a6171d04303da18d9e19ded30146643d7cbad6, Commit 9b64e188b59a395300a2f5d6022df9dbbae2f426 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
