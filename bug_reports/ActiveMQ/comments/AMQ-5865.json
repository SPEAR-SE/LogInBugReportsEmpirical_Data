[Attached sample files for my fix (STOMP over wss).
Should be easy to change the real implementation with this samples ;-), see also http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Enable-quot-getRemoteAddress-quot-method-in-WebSocket-Requests-tt4698179.html, GitHub user cshannon opened a pull request:

    https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/124

    https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5865

    StompSocket and MQTTSocket will now return the appropriate web socket
    remote address based on the HttpRequestServlet that initialized
    the web socket connection.
