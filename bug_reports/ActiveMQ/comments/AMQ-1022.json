[Please give this test build a try and let me know how it goes ...

http://people.apache.org/~nmittler/apache-activemq-4.2-incubator-SNAPSHOT.tar.gz
, Ignore my previous comment - this build is for a different issue., This needs clarification: this is a transacted session, and a perssistent queue. 
producer.send does NOT raise an exception
session.commit does NOT raise an excepton. 
Instead an asynchronous exception is raised to ExceptionListener.
Still the same problem.]
