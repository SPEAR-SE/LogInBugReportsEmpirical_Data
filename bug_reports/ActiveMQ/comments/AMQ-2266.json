[Same issue for me. How to pass username and password for browse? Not documented or lack of feature?
, I saw a fix in 5.6, can it be backported to 5.3.x or at least 5.5.x?

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3411, If you build 5.3.2 or 5.5.1 by yourself, this patch can be applied cleanly.
We backport this patch along with several others onto a build of 5.3.2 and 5.5.1
