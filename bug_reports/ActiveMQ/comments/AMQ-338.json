[Should be fixed now.  Message dispatching once a message arrived to a conection could either go:
1. connection - > session -> consumer : the standard jms case of message consumers
2. connection -> connection consumer -> session -> message listener : for the MDB and MDP case of message consnumers.

The session was hadling reassembling fragmented messages.  Unfortunatley, in case #2 the fragments were being dispatched to different sessions.  I fixed the problem by moving the reassembly code to the connection level.]
