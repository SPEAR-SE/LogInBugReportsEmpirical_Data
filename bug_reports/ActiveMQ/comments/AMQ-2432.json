[Attached a patch for root pom.xml.  This patch upgrades to bundle plugin 2.0.1 and sets a version policy that will generate imports and exports as [5.3,5.4), meaning you can upgrade minor versions within the 5.3 releases, but not 5.4 (which seemed suitable for ActiveMQ)., Patch applied to trunk and merged to 5.3 branch. Thanks]
