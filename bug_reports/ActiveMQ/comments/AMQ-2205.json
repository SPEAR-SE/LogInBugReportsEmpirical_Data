[To make AMQ 5.2 connection work with other brokers I had to initialize the BrokerService of the NetworkConnector witj  the AMQ SSLContext object (and not the jsse one).

NetworkConnector netCon = broker.addnetworkConnector (uri);

if (netCon.getBrokerService() != null){
            	netCon.getBrokerService().setSslContext(amqSSLContext);
}, The amq ssl Context maintains a thread local for the jsse context. I wonder does the broker in your code have an associated amq sslContext?

, Yes. The AMQ SSL context was initialized on the thread local (through SSLcontext.setCurrentSslContext (..) ) every time I'm adding new broker to my network.
Yet, until I initialized the broker service explicitly the error above had occurred and the brokers network was not established.

, No test case to use to investigate this one further.  ]
