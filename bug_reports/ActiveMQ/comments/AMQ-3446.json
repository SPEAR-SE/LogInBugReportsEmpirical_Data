NetworkOfBrokersTest shows that ttl1 works when ttl2 failes, Nice work Victor:)

In my words:
we have 3 brokers, *A*, *B* and *C*.
Each of them is connected to the other in a network connector

<broker name="*A*" >
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerB*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerB:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerC*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerC:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
</broker>

<broker name="*B*" >
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerA*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerA:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerC*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerC:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
</broker>

<broker name="*C*" >
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerA*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerA:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
     <networkConnector name="*toBrokerB*" uri="static:(tcp://brokerB:61618" networkTTL="*2*" />
</broker>



Client is registered on topic X into brokerA
*brokerA* then register on topic X to *broker B*
*brokerB* then register on topic X to *broker C*


If you produce message on topic *X* to *brokerC* , the client consumer will receive the message.
But then, if you stop *brokerB* and send/produce message to topic *X* on *brokerC*, the client consumer won't receive the message.

, have you run your test case with full trace level logging, that will show you the message dispatch and the implementation of the ttl limits in the network bridges.
Also have a peek at: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2484, I've run it with trace level, but don't see something interesting.
The attached test is a full maven project that you can run within a minute and see what I mean.

May be I didn't explain it clear enough, it seems after a specific sequence of actions there is a consumer that will never receive messages from broker in the network unless a restart to the consumer (or may be specific broker) will be done. It is not a 'one message issue' but a state when messages no longer consumed. So it seems the issue https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2484 is not related to this one.
