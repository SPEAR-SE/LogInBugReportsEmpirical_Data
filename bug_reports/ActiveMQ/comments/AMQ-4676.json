[@Steve thank for the patch. It is great to see an problem report with a solution :-)
I had a quick peek at the broker diff, there are a bunch of white space/formatting changes that make it difficult to easily see what has changed but it seems sensible.
one thought; rather than change the signature of the existing methods that folks may depend on, it may be better to move the annotations to new wrapper methods with the suppressed/modified exceptions. , That's a really good idea.  Would you like me to provide a patch with that solution?, yes please!, Attached new patches that does not cause potential backwards incompatible signature changes., Made changes to trunk based on these patches, code has changed a bit since 5.8.0.  Might want to double check that I got them all. , Just wanted to verify, I checked out the latest trunk and looks like you got them all.  Thanks!]
