AMQ-6858 - Fix several durable subscription bridge propagation issues

Durable network proxy subs will now be properly created across multiple
bridges when 3 or more brokers are used.  Demand will be properly synced
and removed.
, I will let CI run before closing this out to make sure nothing was broken., Current CI looks good but I found a couple of other tweaks I need to make as I was doing some more testing locally.  I will push up another commit to modify this in the next few days., The current approach I took seems to have a lot of edge case issues so I'll be re-working this., Commit 41211c78d19b545a2352584d3598346aa3705be4 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

AMQ-6858 - reworking durable subscription propagation fix

Significantly reworking previous fix so that the client id is properly
changed when tracking network proxy subscriptions. This makes it so
removal is done properly

AMQ-6858 - Allow configuration of the client Id token in network bridge

The client id token that is used to separate parts of a generated local
client id in a network bridge should be configurable so bridge names and
broker names can contain underscores if desired
, This is looking pretty good but there is still one more thing I think I need to fix which is handling the case of broker restarts and not just bridge restarts.  It seems to be not re-adding the subscription quite right so it isn't always being cleaned up later.  I will work on that before closing this out., Commit 6013441a9a7c4a13f7412d6d72638de0f420e6a3 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

, I'm going to close this as resolved.  Everything seems to be working as intended.  I merged the commits back to 5.15.3 as this is just a bunch of bug fixes and not a new feature.]
