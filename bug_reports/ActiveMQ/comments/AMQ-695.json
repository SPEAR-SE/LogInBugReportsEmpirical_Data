[ Looks like a bug in the way that temporary destinations are being cleaned up. This should not affect you normal processing of messages. I will start working on a patch to fix this issue. The side-effect of this bug is that a little bit of memory will not be reclaimed every time a temporary destination is created and destroyed. If you have long lived temporary destinations, this may not be a big issue for you.
