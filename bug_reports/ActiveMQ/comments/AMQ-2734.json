[the full stacktrace and associated reconnection logs, Forgot to mention that we amended the FailoverTransport#handleTransportFailure() method to capture the full stack trace (could probably have been done with AOP or BTrace as well). Would appreciate if someone could look into this., Is the fix available in 5.4.2? 

After getting this exception gets Session closed exception if we try to sent message as shown below

Jan 13 15:26:28 127.0.0.1 aused by: javax.jms.IllegalStateException: The Session is closed Jan 13 15:26:28 127.0.0.1 at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.checkClosed(ActiveMQSession.java:722)
Jan 13 15:26:28 127.0.0.1 at org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.createProducer(ActiveMQSession.java:922)

Is there any specific reason for session being closed after java.lang.InterruptedException ?
, Fixes in the VM Transport in 5.5.0 should resolve this issue, reopen if the problem reoccurs.]
