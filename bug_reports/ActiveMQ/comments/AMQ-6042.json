[See attached MessageListenerRedeliveryTest.java where I added a test called testTransactedQueueSessionListenerExceptionDlq() that is using a transacted session.

Without above suggested change to ActiveMQMessageConsumer the test fails because the 'cause' is not there. WIth the change, the tests succeeds., This seems like a valid issue, the cause bit seems applicable regardless of the session ack mode.  Simillar issue raised against the NMS client in AMQNET-513., Just one more thing: the version of the NMS client 1.6.2 is working fine, Commit 4a27b72377bf8104b1a586bb26946c59508a3f26 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

Apply fix and test from Martin Lichtin to preserve the rollback cause in
all ack modes.  , Fix and test added with thanks.]
