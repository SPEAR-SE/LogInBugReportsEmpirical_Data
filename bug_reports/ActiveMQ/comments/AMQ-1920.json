[A work around is to use a prefetch of 1. I don't see the huge need for supporting both prefetch size of zero and to support a notification of messages being available. Afterall the only reason to use a prefetch of zero is if you are gonna block a thread in a receive() method anyway., downgraded from critical as this discusses a rare-case optimisation to try avoid using a blocking thread when using zero prefetch - an easy workaround is to use prefetch of 1 or just use a blocking thread with prefetch of zero]
