[I used MAT to detect memory leak, Can you provide some more information ? - a test case would be ideal. JMX Objects do take up a lot of memory - is this in normal operation ? (do you see this when re-started ?)., I do not have test case, but if I set useJmx="false" in the broker,  the memory leak disappear. I can provide my configuration files in attachement., Not test case or information allowing this to be tested or reproduced., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
