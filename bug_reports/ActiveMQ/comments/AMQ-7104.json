[Hi, Is there any update on this issue., This question is better suited for the user forums as there is nothing here that demonstrates an actual problem.

The only thing the logs show are an error syncing to storage and this is most likely something with your environment and has nothing to do with ActiveMQ.Â  Also, I see errors with username/password.

In order to do anything you would need to demonstrate an actual issue that we could reproduce in order to fix., Hi Christopher/Team,

We are using SMB for shared storage. Is it supported for AMQ?

Regards,

K.R.Siddardha, You can ask for help on the users forum, SMB is not a good option though no]
