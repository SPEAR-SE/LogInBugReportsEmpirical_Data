[Dear Apache team,

We are using your product (apache-activemq-5.14.0) for the high loaded product that provides messages (sms/viber) delivery service across 10+ countries and for 50M + users. 
Just yesterday we faced the described above issue what lead us to unavailability of the service during 47 minutes and many unpleasant calls from our clients. 
Because of this, I would like you to clarify following moments:
The issue has a status OPEN since it created (more that one year) when to expect the fix?
Will an update up to version 5.15.0 fix this problem or decrease a probability of the risk to face this issue again? 

Look forward to have your comments/answer soon.
Thank you!
