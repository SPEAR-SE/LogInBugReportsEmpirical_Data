[requires the resolution to https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2473, An aditional bit of sql dialect wizardy is required to make the query good for a really large table., on the audit recovery query limit:
It needs to be maxConcurrentProducers * maxBatchSize * maxDestinations

but with jmstemplate, producers can change with every send, so the maxConcurrentProducers can be large and also the maxProducersToAudit value needs to be large. 
With interleaving there can be quite a collection of outstanding producers and transactions., resolved through 891582,891622,892194,892242,892291,892729,892759

all on 5.3.1, thanks dejan]
