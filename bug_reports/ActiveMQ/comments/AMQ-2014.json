[It seems that portfolio.js never subscribes to destinations (at least Firebug says so) by issuing a POST call. 

So if I change

amq.addPollHandler(portfolioPoll);

with direct 

amq.addListener('stocks','topic://STOCKS.*',priceHandler._price);

everything works fine.

I'm not sure yet why there is a difference in behavior, since there were no code changes in this part of the source tree.

Can others confirm this issue?
, The _startPolling function which issues a GET request with timeout 0 hangs with post 5.0.0 amq versions (if there are no registered listeners) and thus blocks all other JavaScript. I modified the call to timeout after 10ms and now all examples work again. Committed in SVN revision 722093.]
