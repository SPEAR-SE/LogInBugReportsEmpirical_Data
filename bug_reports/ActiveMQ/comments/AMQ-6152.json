(cherry picked from commit 8c4b5f485d64caec97b0abe2b721d47bc19bfba1)
, [~tabish121] Was this included in the 5.13.2 release? I don't see it listed in the release notes [here|https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311210&version=12334251], That's because that is the 5.13.1 release notes, see it on 5.13.2 notes here: https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/ReleaseNote.jspa?projectId=12311210&version=12334774, Great! for what it's worth, the link on the release page [here|http://activemq.apache.org/activemq-5132-release.html] is pointing to the old one then., Fixed, should show up on the next site update.  Thanks for spotting that. , Commit de681b93757010d86f566ed148bfa5e60bd843e4 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.11.x from [~tabish121]
