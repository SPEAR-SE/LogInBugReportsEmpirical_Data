[fixed rev 735914., I'm not sure this is the right place, but starting from 5.10.0, that part of code has been deleted:
        if (!transacted && acknowledgeMode == Session.SESSION_TRANSACTED) {
            acknowledgeMode = Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE;
        }

The session is not transacted and absent an XA transaction, we are left with a problem an exception when we try to commit the ActiveMQ session.

Was there an issue and what is the back story for it, so I can change our code accordingly.

Thank you very much., Ok. I found this:
http://marc.info/?l=activemq-commits&m=139483965611120&w=2

with a remark regarding proper use of transactions. Hopefully the dude saw this issue., https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5264 provides a way to have explicit control, even in a managed env., Thanks for the info. However, it's added for release 5.11.0, I think we can assume that for 5.10.0 there is no way to manage your own session.
Anyway, sticking to the JMS specs doesn't seem like the worse idea. Probably that's the direction we're going to go for.

Thanks again for your promptness.
