[I've included a patch built against a recent 5.1-SNAPSHOT source (svn rev 618082)

The file FailoverTransport.java, includes fixes for 4 issues, including hbuch's fix for this issue.

The other issues that this patch includes fixes for are:

AMQ-1116
AMQ-1575
AMQ-1577
AMQ-1581

The file ConnectionPool.java is also needed for the fix for AMQ-1581

I've added comments in the code that clearly indicate which sections apply to which issue, so you can easily take edit to include only the fixes you want specifically.
