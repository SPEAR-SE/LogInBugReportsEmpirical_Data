[We see exactly the same error with 5.5.0-fuse-00-27 in high load condition, but only one time.
We suspect a problem with the SAN / filesystem that cause a filestore corruption.
After server restart all seems OK.
Do you have any test case to reproduce this error / bug ?

 , We are also seeing the same behavior and the issue is resolved on restart. Can someone help understand why this issue occurs?

Thanks
Mav, No test case provided.  There were a large number of fixes to KahaDB for v5.6.0 recommend using the new release.  ]
