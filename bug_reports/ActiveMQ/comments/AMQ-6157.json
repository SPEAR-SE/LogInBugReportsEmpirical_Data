[Attached by ActiveMQ configuration and full dump from jstack, This seems to be the result of you not closing failed connections.  Since you've set the maxReconnectAttempts=2 the transport will only try to connect twice before giving up, at which point you need to handle the exception from the connection failure and close the connection. , At this point I haven't deployed any of my code, only a clean installation of Tomee plus with some jars added for spring bean support, and with the configuration attached, I see, you are using the failover transport bits with the JMS Bridge.  The bridge has it's own reconnection logic so you don't actually need to use failover here, and I'd guess there's some side effect that is causing the bridge to malfunction because of the use of the failover transport.  , I did some trivial testing and cannot reproduce this using the latest codebase, try moving from 5.10.0 to something more current and see how it goes.  If you can create a JUnit test that reproduces that problem I'm happy to look into it more.  , You are right, the problem is not in the failover but in the JMS bridge, or the use of both in combination. Since failover is not needed here it does not seem like a real problem.

Thanks for your help
