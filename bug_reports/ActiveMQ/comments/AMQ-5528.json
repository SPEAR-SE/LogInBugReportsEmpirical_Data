[Questions like these should go to the users mailing list, if a real problem is identified then an issue can be opened with reproducer tests and detailed problem descriptions. , Sorry Timothy if I didn't respect the standard process for post an issue.
What do you mean by these should go to users mailing list ?
It's a real problem believe me, I test everything (I think), I look the code for try this problem.
In fact, the is two similar object in activeMQ :
org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory and org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQConnectionFactory
For the Producer, The ra.ConnectionFactory is injected, and this class is correctly managed by the container.
But for MDB, the non ra is used and non managed so without configuration.
Maybe I can to give an ear for test that in glassfish ?
For test, it's really easy, 
1 activemq
1 glassfish with resources created
1 ear
Tell me.]
