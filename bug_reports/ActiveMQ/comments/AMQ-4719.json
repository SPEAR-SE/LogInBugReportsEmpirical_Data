[Fixed on trunk, The allowLinkProperty on the TransportConnector does not get set as passed in as an optional parameter to the TransportConnector, Link Stealing is enabled now by default for MQTT transport(s) - 
AMQP is tricky - as enabling it will break JMS semantics for JMS over AMQP clients - so left to the user to decide - e.g. in the broker config enable link stealing:

<transportConnector name="nio" uri="nio://0.0.0.0:61616?allowLinkStealing=true "/>  , Rob do you mind adding some documentation notes about this new allowLinkStealing option?, This wasn't enabled for some reason for MQTTSslTransportFactory. I've fixed that and added a test case to verify that it works for MQTT. 
It looks like I don't have the appropriate permissions to re-open this issue or administer any ActiveMQ issues right now. I will send a request to the Apache PMC to fix that. , The option was not set by default in MQTTSslTransportFactory. , [~dhirajsb] Hi Dhiraj. Can you please verify the same for websockets ? it's not working.

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5237, Hi Surf, can you try adding the allowLinkStealing attribute as mentioned at http://activemq.apache.org/configuring-transports.html in the transportConnector element in your broker.xml? , Updated tests now passing in Jenkins and on my local machine.  ]
