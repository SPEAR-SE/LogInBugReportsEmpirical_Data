[Patch applied in SVN 906071., Is it possible to include this patch in the 5.3.1 release?
Sorry if this is a stupid question - i'm very new to the whole activemq thing and so i have very limited knowledge about activemq's release cycles and bugfix strategies.
I'm asking because i want to use ActiveMQ with the NMS Compact Framework Stomp client. Since i reckon that the devices are distributed to uncontrollable environment i depend on the fix to avoid the possibility of spoofing., Merged changes to 5.3 branch as well]
