[do you have any test code that can reproduce this issue? Wonder what causes the stats to become invalid?, hi, usually if you do resetStatistics in jconsole, later the queueSize will be unreliable. then purge will cause issue most of the time. It happened a while ago for us. I remembered if you don't do resetStatistics, it will also happen very often if you do purge in jconsole when the broker is actively serving msgs., This issue can be reproduce easly sending message to a duplicate composite destination.
In the test case, 100 messages are really in the queue but the queueSize indicate 200.
Purge cause infinite loop.

{code}
public class SendDuplicateMessage {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        ActiveMQConnectionFactory cf = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory("smx", "smx", "tcp://localhost:50910");
        PooledConnectionFactory pool = new PooledConnectionFactory();
        pool.setConnectionFactory(cf);
        pool.start();

        JmsTemplate jt = new JmsTemplate(pool);

        StringBuffer text = new StringBuffer();
        for (int n=0; n<1000; n++) {
            text.append("0123456789");
        }

        final String body = text.toString();

        for (int i=0; i<100; i++) {
            final String messageNo = "message #" + i;
            System.out.println(messageNo);
            jt.send("testQueue,testQueue", new MessageCreator() {
                public Message createMessage(Session session) throws JMSException {
                    TextMessage m = session.createTextMessage();
                    m.setText(body);
                    m.setStringProperty("info", messageNo);
                    return m;
                }
            });
        }
        pool.stop();
    }

}

{code}, Resolved with svn revisions 936798 and 936811. These are two separated issues. 936798 solves the purge problem when message count doesn't match queue stats. Giampaolo's test reveal the other issue and that is duplicate destinations in composite which causes this mismatch. 936811 solves this by preventing that duplicate messages are sent in this case.]
