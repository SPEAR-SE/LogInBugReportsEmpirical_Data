[Committed revision 700746
pendingAck, used to accumulate acks was not being cleared on transaction commit message ack, so a pending ack was being attempting to be send on shutdown over a failover connection that would hang waiting for a reconnect that would never happen as test was on the way out. In essence, messages already acked were being acked at dispose in error, which resulted in the hang.]
