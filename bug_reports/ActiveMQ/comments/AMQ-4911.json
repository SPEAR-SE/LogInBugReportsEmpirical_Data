[i used following broker config 

   <broker ... >
...
        <persistenceAdapter>
            <jdbcPersistenceAdapter dataDirectory="${data}" dataSource="#mysql-ds" useLock= false/>
        </persistenceAdapter>
...
    </broker>, You'd need to provide details of how your RAC connection is configured, and how failover is being handled. Transparent application failover (TAF) is only a feature of the OCI driver. And TAF exists only for SELECT queries - not for locking or modifying queries, so in any case for failover to work we'd need application code to handle the failover.

And Kishan, what does a "mysql-ds" do in a ticket specific to Oracle RAC?]
