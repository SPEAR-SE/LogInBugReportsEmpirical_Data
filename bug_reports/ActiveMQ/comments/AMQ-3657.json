[This is working as designed.  The prefetch option is your way of controlling whether a consumer gets more than one message dispatched to it when it subscribes, for each consumer you need to determine if you are going to load balance on a destination or be a single consumer.  In the case you are seeing as the consumers subscribe the Queue will distribute across the consumers once they all subscribed but the initial consumer is going to get sent more than one message if your prefect is set greater than one., My bad,

I should have looked at this too
