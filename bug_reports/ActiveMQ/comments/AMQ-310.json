[URLs are case sensitive; as are most JMX and JNDI names - ditto most file systems. 

Its only SQL which seems to have this obsession with being case insensitive. I'd have thought case sensitive was a good thing?

I guess if you really want case insensitivity we could add some kinda interceptor so that all marshalled destinations in and out of brokers and clients automatically get changed to upper case or something., I think I was just looking for clarification.  Are apps are usually careful with destination names,  but found one that was not "upper casing" and was causing a problem.  This is the third JMS product that we have used and the first to show this particular nuance.

I do not believe this to be an error as I can find nothing in the specification that indicates that case insensitivity is required.  Maybe a mention in the javadocs might be appropriate, but beyond that I would not recommend a change.  Maybe someone else is depending on this nuance. :D
, Thanks Dennis. I've added a FAQ entry for this one
