[Attached sample code to reproduce the OutOfMemory along with my AMQ configuration.   Also notice heap snapshot pictures showing the leak.in the Queue messagesWaitingForSpace map., You should run your tests against a 5.10-SNAPSHOT as there are a number of fixes since 5.8 that could resolve this., Could you provide a link where I can download the 5.10-SNAPSHOT tar.gz ?  , Found it https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.10-SNAPSHOT/
, I reproduced the OutOfMemoryError using 5.10-SNAPSHOT.

See attached activemq-5.10.xml for configuration.  
I also added system=manager to users.properties and system to admins groups in groups.properties.


, Attaching configuration used with 5.10-SNAPSHOT., we had a similar issue and were able to mitigate it by setting a per queue memory limit...that said, we have flow control disabled as well, so the scenario might be a bit different...

     <policyEntry queue=">" producerFlowControl="false" memoryLimit="100mb">]
