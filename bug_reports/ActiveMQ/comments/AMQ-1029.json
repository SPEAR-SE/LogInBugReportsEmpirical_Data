[Thanks! 

patch  applied to :
trunk : 477570
4.1 branch: 477571

Btw,  I just added a bit of code to clear the transportConnectors list before replacing it with the started instances  :)  
 ie.           .....
                this.transportConnectors.clear();
            	setTransportConnectors(al);
               ...., thanks. Will it also be applied to 4.0.2 (which I'm still using currently)?, sorry about that, forgot to apply it on the 4.0 branch: 

it's applied at 4.0 branch : r478063]
