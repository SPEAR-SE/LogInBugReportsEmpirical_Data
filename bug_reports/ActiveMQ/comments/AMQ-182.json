[Noticed that this is JDBC persistence problem.  Test passed against jdbm ., Created a test case in DurableSubscriptionTestSupport.java for the problem.  See: http://cvs.activemq.codehaus.org/viewrep/activemq/activemq/modules/assembly/src/test/org/codehaus/activemq/usecases/DurableSubscriptionTestSupport.java?r=1.2#l186, James, not sure if you or Stewie might be able to fix this better.  

But I tracked part of the problem down to the DurableTopicMessageContainerManager.  When an existing durable sub goes online, the call to subscriptionContainer.getSubscription(info.getConsumerId()); 
it does not get the exisiting subscription due to the getConsumerId() giving back a different value than what the subscription was created with.  Since 

consumerId = clientId + "." + sessionId + "." + consumerNo;  

The sessionId/consumerNo is changing with a new connection., Fixed]
