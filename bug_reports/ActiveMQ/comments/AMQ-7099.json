[Please ask for support on the users mailing list, How this can be closed without proper resolution.

It would be good to close this once after getting proper resolution, so that it will be helpful for others. 

Thanks,, {color:#333333}To be clear. From the trace, we set the default SSLSocketFactory is our com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLSocketFactory class. This class lives in the /opt/IBM/WebSphere/AppServer/plugins/com.ibm.ws.security.crypto.jar. This jar is signed using a key that is only known to the IBMJCE Provider. If you set a different crypto Provider, you will need to utilize a NON com.ibm.websphere.ssl.protocol.SSLSocketFactory class.{color}
{color:#333333} {color}
{color:#333333}So if MQ is setting a different Provider, they can not utilize the default SSLSocketFactory.{color}

{color:#333333}When we rollback the ActiveMQ update, the application authenticates and connects as expected. {color}, Please use the users mailing list to ask for help with working out a configuration that works with IBM this does not appear to be a bug, and the version being tried is not a supported version. ]
