[Fancy taking a stab at these Adrian? :), Fix added to: http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=548207

Though I've decided to just create a simple Utilities class to do the converting from arrays to string. Just to avoid adding a dependency to spring and keep the examples simpler.

Thanks for the heads up Woonsan. :), Yes, for the examples, Utilities class looks neater than spring dependency. Thanks!
Cheers.]
