[AMQ-6584] Fix feature to make it work for karaf 4.1.0
, [~chris@die-schneider.net], I marked this issue and AMQ-6591 as resolved as they appear to be done and I am going to work on a 5.14.4 build.  Let me know if they should be reopened., For 5.14 we are all clear. I just was looking into the test failures on 5.13.x but it is fine to resolve these issues.]
