[Are you using the tar.gz distribution?  On my 64 bit Linux box I have no problems running with the tar.gz distribution which is meant for unix., I am using tar.gz(apache-activemq-5.13.0-bin.tar.gz)

Please find  my system configurations.

-bash-4.1$ uname -a
SunOS waivwebmq03 5.11 11.2 sun4v sparc sun4v
-bash-4.1$ getconf LONG_BIT
32
-bash-4.1$
, It looks like you are using SunOS on sparc hardware (your original description says linux).  Unfortunately, not too many developers have access to a workstation running in that environment so it will be hard to try and debug your problem.  Contributions are welcome however, so I would suggest taking a look at the startup script and seeing if you can determine the problem and maybe propose a fix.  You can also try mailing the users forum to see if anyone else is running with SunOS who might be able to help., This appears to be environmental or configuration related but not able to validate given the lack of access to the target environment.  Would recommend that the question go to the users list. ]
