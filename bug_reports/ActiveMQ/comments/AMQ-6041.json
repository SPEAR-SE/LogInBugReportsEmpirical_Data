[I don't see an actual deadlock in the trace, are you sure you aren't just running out of memory due to incorrectly configured JVM and ActiveMQ memory usage options?, sorryï¼Œi think this is my wrong,,actuallly  because i am careless.   JVM memory is full. but application that throws OOM  have not been reached . after a moment , it is good !!!!!!
