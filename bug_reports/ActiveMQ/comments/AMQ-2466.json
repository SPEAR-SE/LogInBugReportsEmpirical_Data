[For the time being, a simple optional import like the one in this patch would suffice if this is an optional command.  If this is going to be more of a core command, the resolution:=optional could be dropped and we will just have to add josql as a prerequisite system bundle in ServiceMix., Patch applied, thanks Chris. I think it will do for the moment, especially since the feature needs more work in future., josql artifacts do not seem to be in central. Is fusesource our best bet for a repo atm.
