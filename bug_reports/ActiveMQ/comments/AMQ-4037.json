[you may need to use http://activemq.apache.org/timestampplugin.html or sync the clocks across your machines, The ComputerA(MQ Server) time is Tue Sep 11 19:46:09 CST 2012.
The ComputerB time is Wed Sep 12 03:53:06 CST 2012.And I set time to live is 200.
I add content "<timeStampingBrokerPlugin futureOnly="true"/>" to activemq.xml's plugins.
But consumerA still cann't recieve the message from producerB correctly., Have you tried using a longer TTL value?, Need some sort of test case to validate this, all tests currently show no problem here., Not test case or other supporting info provided to test this one.]
