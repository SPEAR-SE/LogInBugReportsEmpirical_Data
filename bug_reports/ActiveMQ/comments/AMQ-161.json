[To run the test:
-unzip the broker-test.zip file and run maven on in it's root directory
-startup a broker using broker1.xml  
-startup a second broker using broker2.xml  
-open three command windows
-in window 1 --> run maven r1
-in window 2 --> run maven r2
-in window 3 --> run maven s1

after maven s1 completes:
-in window 1 --> ctrl-break
-in window 1 --> run maven r1 (again)
  ---> you should see the messages being redelivered
* continue this "ctrl-break + run maven r1" in window 1, This is fixed in the latest version 2 snapshot]
