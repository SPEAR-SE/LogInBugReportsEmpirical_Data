[Started in forum thread http://www.nabble.com/Usage-Manager-for-durable-offline-subscriber-t4572289s2354.html#a13051280, TopicStorePrefetch has a system usage manager that is not used by Message (broker.region package). It instead uses the increment/decrement to inform the regionBroker's system usage manager which happens to be a different one. 

So the listener implemented by DurableTopicSubscription never results in an actual call back and hence the leak ?? 

I don't understand this one completely but i hope it helps whoever looks at this issue, Fixed by svn revision 587033, Thanks Rob! It does great under the performance tests as well. Any thoughts on how to include/modify these tests for the build ?]
