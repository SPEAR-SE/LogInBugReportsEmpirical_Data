[Attaching a test case to reproduce this issue (tested on ubuntu and redhat).

This issue is critical for me as it prevents from using a cluster configuration in production. Can someone consider raising this issue priority ?
, The topology we want to have is as follows:

machine A: 
 masterBroker1
 slaveBroker2

machine B:
 masterBroker2
 slaveBroker1

or more machines to have pure master/slave pair

on client machine, we want to indicate only the masters:
failover://(tcp://masterBroker1:port, tcp://masterBroker2:port)
so the slaves are only used for replication purpose.

if any one broker regardless of master or slave dies, its corresponding master or slave will finish what it is doing but not accepting new messages or connections and all the messages will failover to the available masters.

Is this a feasible in the current release?

After all, the goal for us is to have network of brokers to have HA and slaves only for replication so messages are not lost. Thanks 
, Took some time today on this and issued the attached patch.
I don't know if it is correct but it seems to solve the problem.

Will run the tests to check for regressions.
