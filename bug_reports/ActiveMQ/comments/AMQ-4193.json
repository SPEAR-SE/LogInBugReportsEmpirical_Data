[I have kept trace,debug values in log.property file.Still not able to get the details of this issue., this is still a bug, Importing the activemq-jdbc.xml is wrong here, and probably the cause of all your problems.  You should configure the broker service in one file not try to combine to configurations., 
I got your point that having multiple brokers is causing the issue when I tried to import one xml into another one. As you know, In activemq installation directory,there is a separate activemq-jdbc.xml for custorm persistance support. 
When we startup activemq, basically this is not the xml we will run.we would run the activemq.xml which has default kaha database persistance and not custom shared datasource.

So , I tried to import activemq-jdbc.xml into  activemq.xml, commenting out the duplicate entries like <transportConnectors>.However, now that i noticed that broker property is being present in both the xml,which u suggest is problematic.

So, do we need to add the additional properties[say 
        <destinationPolicy>,   <systemUsage>
] present in activemq.xml into activemq-jdbc.xml ,instead of importing ? 
If this is the case,then we need to run activemq-jdbc.xml when using persistance in particular ,during activemq startup.

I will try this approach and get back to you earliest. kindly let me know for any suggestions.
, If your broker is supposed to used JDBC persistence then you should modify the activemq-jdbc.xml to meet your needs and run with that, if KahaDB is what you want then the activemq.xml makes a good starting point.  Having two brokerService entries isn't going to get you what you are after. , Thank u ..it works as u suggest.]
