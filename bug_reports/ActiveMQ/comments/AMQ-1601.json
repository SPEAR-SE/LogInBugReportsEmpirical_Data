[similar issue and the fix is relevant., this issue is resolved on trunk, see the resolution to the linked issue.

Re the test case: I made the following small changes, diff:
{code}53c53
< 		for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES; attempt++) {
---
> 		for (int attempt = 0; attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES; attempt++) {
59c59
< 				if (attempt < MAX_REDELIVERIES) {
---
> 				if (attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES) {
78c78
< 		for (int attempt = 1; attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES; attempt++) {
---
> 		for (int attempt = 0; attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES; attempt++) {
84c84
< 				if (attempt < MAX_REDELIVERIES) {
---
> 				if (attempt <= MAX_REDELIVERIES) {
{code}
as you need to exceed the max deliveries to get a null message. But with these changes it works on trunk.]
