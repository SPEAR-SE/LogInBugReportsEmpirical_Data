[That NPE is coming from the cursor so it is using the temp store. If it occurs after a restart you may have a test case in the making because the temp store does not persist through restarts. it is recreated as needed.
It would be great of you could wrangle up a test app that can reproduce.

As a workaround, consider using the default store cursor rather than the file pending message cursor., Unfortunately the exceptions did *not* occur again after a restart.

What did happen after a restart was that message delivery was very shaky. Message delivery worked to some clients and not to others. I have absolutely no idea why. I suspect that those NPEs corrupted some state (possibly in the clients) that survived the broker restart.  It was not possible for us to restart all clients at once, as they are not under our direct control.

As this happened on a large production system that we could not afford to keep down for debugging we have temporarily switched back to our old (non-JMS) messaging system.

Thanks for the tip about a possible workaround. , Attaching a test case that can reproduce this exception. , resolve in r997849

would  be great if you could validate tonight's 5.5-SNAPSHOT or build trunk yourself to validate., Commit a0d05f8ea3e883a16d86b4a6755f7fc1a503f55b in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]
