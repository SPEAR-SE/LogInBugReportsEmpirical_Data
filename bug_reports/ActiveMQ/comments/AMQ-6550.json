[Attached the configuration of two brokers ([^activemq_pub.xml] & [^activemq_sub.xml]). This will help in understanding the topology I am using., Please try using the latest release 5.14.3, Thanks [~tabish121]. I want to confirm whether it is a known issue that has been addressed in latest version? We upgraded the customer to 5.13.2 to resolve some other issues. So before we ask them to upgrade again I would like to know if this is a known problem., [~tabish121]: Out of curiosity, I cloned the ActiveMQ source from git repository at https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq.git and searched for the method *isAllowLinkStealing* in the source. I get following code for the method in the *org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnector* class (i.e. where I am getting the exception).

{code:xml}
    @Override
    public boolean isAllowLinkStealing() {
        return server.isAllowLinkStealing();
    }
{code}

Because there is a NullPointerException, this means that the server object is Null. Adding a Null check in the method can avoid the NullPointerException but I don't know if this is going to solve the actual issue.
, Recommend you create a unit test to reproduce the issue and test on newer broker releases.]
