[We have been having this same issue as well. We are not able to reliably reproduce the problem however. Once it occurs, we have to delete the filestore and we lose our messages. As a result, we are unable to take advantage of LevelDB performance and have had to revert back to KahaDB., actually, it's more or less possible to restore corrupt store file, but it needs way more attention., [~nfx] How do you restore a corrupt store? , LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
