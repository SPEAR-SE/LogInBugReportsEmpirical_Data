[Will try to work out a JUnit test later., This seems to be caused by the default file and dir name lengths used when converting dests to filenames. In code these are defined in activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/util/IOHelper.java as 

{code:title=IOHelper.java}
static {
  MAX_DIR_NAME_LENGTH = Integer.getInteger("MaximumDirNameLength", 200);
  MAX_FILE_NAME_LENGTH = Integer.getInteger("MaximumFileNameLength", 64);
}
{code}


*Possible workarounds:*

- Don't use perDestination=true with mKahaDB

- don't use destination names > 50 characters.

- Pass the JVM option -DMaximumFileNameLength=150 to the broker JVM (or any other value >64 that holds the full destination name plus another 14 characters that get prepended when mapping the destination to a kahadb folder). 

, Torsten, aren't these based on Windows normal Max length values?  If long names are used the user can increase the max length values and things should work as expected., Closing since the params are set to enable windows support and can be changed as needed for longer names. ]
