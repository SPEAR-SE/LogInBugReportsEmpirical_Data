[This application demonstrates the issue. Run the application, and observe the SEVERE level log message "Unable to accept connection", Justin,
I put this test in a loop and ran 20 times against trunk but did not see the error message. Have you verified with trunk or a 5.3-SNAPSHOT?
thanks


, I have not verified in anything but 5.1. Our product is currently shipping with 5.1. Should I not expect this issue to be addressed in 5.1?, We have this issue with 5.2 and 5.3-snapshot (18 April).

The same application seems to be running ok under XP, OpenSolaris but throws those exceptions at a rate of 1 every minute or so under Ubuntu Server 8.10.

HTH
Benoit., Ran the test many times against 5.6-SNAPSHOT did not see the error described., Can someone point me to a clear, unambiguous statement regarding the policy on versioning and back-porting bugs? At what point does a version become unsupported? So far as I can tell, M.m becomes unsupported the moment M.m+1 is released. This is frustrating because, as I mentioned, we embed the broker in our product, and in the past upgrading minor versions has required significant developer and QA resources to validate. That's a surprise to me., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
