[Fixed on trunk., Could you point to the changes/fix you made? Also wonder if this bug exists with 5.7.0 as well.  I'm seeing a similar fd leak issues especially with huge amount of connections., Look under the source tab of this issue for a list of changed files, you can even generate a patch file from there. ]
