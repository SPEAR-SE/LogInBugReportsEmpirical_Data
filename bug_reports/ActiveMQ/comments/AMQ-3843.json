[this is the same as AMQ-3858 which is now resolved., This is a workaround, to work as 5.5.0 you need sun jdk instead of jre, because of tools.jar usage.
, The older code also needed tools.jar but was limited to only Sun's version.  The new code still need tools.jar but works on most implementations.  The issue was that an NPE was able to sneak out when it wasn't working, that has since been resolved. ]
