thanks for the analysis Chris. Since the users of getDatabaseLocker already check for null i simply return null if a lock is not to be used.
note for future reference: ensure you check the "grant ASF License" check box when you submit a patch or enhancement, otherwise your contribution cannot be used. thanks.]
