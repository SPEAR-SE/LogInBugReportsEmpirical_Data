[I was able to invoke the health() and healthList() methods via jolokia:

{code}
curl -u admin -d "{\"type\":\"exec\",\"mbean\":\"org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=localhost,service=Health\",\"operation\":\"health\"}" http://localhost:8161/api/jolokia/ && echo
{code} 

And:

{code}
curl -u admin -d "{\"type\":\"exec\",\"mbean\":\"org.apache.activemq:type=Broker,brokerName=localhost,service=Health\",\"operation\":\"healthList\"}" http://localhost:8161/api/jolokia/ && echo
{code}

This will update the status value that is reported in 'CurrentStatus'.  The intent is that your service should be polling the health value periodically and then you can report the current status in the interim via the 'CurrentStatus' attribute. , Closing this out as it is working as designed and there doesn't seem to be any issues with call the health methods exposed via Jolokia ]
