[For crying out loud... how does this stuff even get through testing?  This release is even more unusable than 4.1 was., [order is important to a sequence|http://www.w3.org/TR/2004/REC-xmlschema-1-20041028/structures.html#element-sequence], leave the transportConnectors last and it will work.

{code}
<amq:broker brokerName="myBroker" persistent="true"
   useShutdownHook="false" deleteAllMessagesOnStartup="true" useJmx="true" 
   populateJMSXUserID="true" >

   <amq:persistenceAdapter>
      <amq:kahaPersistenceAdapter directory="activemq-data" maxDataFileLength="33554432"/>
   </amq:persistenceAdapter>

   <amq:plugins>
      <!-- lets enable detailed logging in the broker -->
      <amq:loggingBrokerPlugin/>
   </amq:plugins>

   <amq:transportConnectors>
      <amq:transportConnector uri="${brokerUri}" />
   </amq:transportConnectors>
</amq:broker>
{code}

btw: I don't understand why your patch (adding unbounded to the sequence) allows the order to be insignificant and the out of order elements to be parsed. Any idea?
, Hi Gary,

You're right. I moved transportConnectors to the end and it works as designed!

btw: I don't know, I checked with XML Spy and adding unbounded validated it .... so I thought this was the solution.]
