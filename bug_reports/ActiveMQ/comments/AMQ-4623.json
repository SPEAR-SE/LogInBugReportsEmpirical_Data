[Not much for us to go on here.  Did you see any errors etc?  Have you tried a recent 5.9 SNAPSHOT build to see if this is resolved already? , I attached screenshot(screenshot-1.jpg) when executing InstallService.bat(apache-activemq-5.8.0\bin\win64)
on explorer win7 64 bit.
It also same problem with UninstallService.bat, The 5.9 SNAPSHOT(https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.9-SNAPSHOT/apache-activemq-5.9-20130708.151752-73-bin.zip) has same issue., Updated 32 and 64 bit scripts with this change, test on Windows 7 x64 and service is now installable from console or via run as admin in explorer. ]
