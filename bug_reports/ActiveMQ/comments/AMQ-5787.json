, Good catch, there are actually 3 variables with the same problem.  messageQueue and taskRunner have the double locked check problem but taskRunnerFacatory should also be volatile as well to make sure it's visible to all threads since it is lazily initialized in getTaskRunner() if it is null.  I pushed up a pull request to fix all 3., Applied the PR, thanks!, Github user cshannon closed the pull request at:
