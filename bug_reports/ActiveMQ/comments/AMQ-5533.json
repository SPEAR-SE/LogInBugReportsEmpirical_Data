[Proposed patch, "activemq-admin" is not needed anymore, because all of its functionality is already integrated in the "activemq" script.
I spent some time to improve the compatibility of the "activemq" on several unix platforms (also macosx).
My last pull request at AMQ-5503 also contains a testsuite which helps to validate the proper function on macosx.
I hope to get feedback or a successful merge soon...]
