[Fixed on trunk., do you still set maxFrameSize on the transport?


I found out that not setting it at all will make performance to be 10X better due to some issues on Proton. It's a bug on Proton probably and still not fixed., No, it's not set unless the URI of the TransportConnector includes the wireFormat.maxAmqpFrameSize value.]
