[I was experiencing the same exception and tracked it down to a problem in the unmarshal method of the BooleanStream class.  Unmarshalling large objects, like stack traces was causing the error for me.  I was able to workaround by setting wireFormat.stackTraceEnabled=false on my connection URI.

I think the root cause that the 0xE0 bit mask should be 0x80 in the marshal/unmarshal methods but I'm not sure exactly how this code works.  I'll attach a patch that worked for me.  , Potential patch to BooleanStream, Can you review Dave's patch please. If this is valid we need to make similar patches to C# etc, Patch applied - many thanks Dave!

I've added a test case, BooleanTest which demonstrates the problem and validates your patch]
