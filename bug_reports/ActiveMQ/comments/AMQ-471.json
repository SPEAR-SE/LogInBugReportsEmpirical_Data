[Refactored the main class to several task classes and used reflection to run each task., Hi Hiram, I'm not sure if the console package should belong to the broker package, moving it wouldn't be any problem. :), I'm all for moving that code to a activemq.console package!  :)
go for it!, Also, if your task classes are easier to use than using direct JMX, It might be worth adding some nice javadoc so that we can advertise them as the recomended API for java users to manage their brokers.  (Just a low priority Idea, JMX apis are good enough for most folks). , I also wanted to move it to an activemq.console package.  Makes it easier to add other console (Swing, Web, etc.), but thought of getting the console working first again. :) I also think its a good idea to slightly modify the task classes, so it's not dependent on the view, so we could use it as a plugin to other consoles. If you have a recommended design pattern or design strategy, it will be very much welcomed. :D, I'll put on my todo: check out the current tasks and comment if any changes are needed to make them more re-usable.]
