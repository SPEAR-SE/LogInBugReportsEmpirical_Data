[A JUnit test case reproducing the problem would help in getting someone to look into this.  You might also want to try the newer version or a 5.6-SNAPSHOT build to see if the problem has already been addressed., Hi,

Thanks for the quick reply. I'll look at the changelist for 5.5, but just moved to 5.4.2 for same reason to no effect. Coming up with a unit test to expose the error would be hard given our code, but not impossible. First, could we get some feedback from others who worked on the HTTP transport to see if this rings a bell? Clearly similar issues have been discussed w.r.t. TCP dropping large messages. 
, Need a unit test to reproduce the issue, current tests all pass.  No other reports of this problem so far so a working test would be key to figuring out if there's an issue.]
