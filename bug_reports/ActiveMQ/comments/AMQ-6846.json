[what is causing a null message to be stored? The only use of a null message should be to indicate to a queue browse subscription that it should complete, however it should not get into the store in normal operation I think.
Do you have any way to reproduce?, Thanks Gary for your reply. Unfortunatly we do not have a way to reproduce it, it just happened once in our production environment. 
In our operations we do not make use of null messages, so we do not know what is causing null messages to be stored.]
