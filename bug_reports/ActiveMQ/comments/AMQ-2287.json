[Could use the following helper method:

{code:java}
public boolean isJavaIdentifier() {
      int n = length();
      if (n==0) return false;
      if (!Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(charAt(0)))
          return false;
      for (int i = 1; i < n; i++)
          if (!Character.isJavaIdentifierPart(charAt(i)))
              return false;
      return true;
    }
{code}, Please consider my similar issue as well (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3113)... with analysis of this JIRA item., I am going to close this bug. 
If we decide to fix this, it can likely cause backward compatibility problems. 
Given that there was no demand from the community to have this bug fixed, we will not fix this problem right now in favor of compatibility.

If there is need to have this fixed in future, this bug can be reopened again.
