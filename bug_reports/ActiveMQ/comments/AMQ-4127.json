[I think this is just the normal log messages for a client closing down its connection.  Do you actually have an issue or did you just notice these in the logs?, it's not just a log report.
this issue cause disconnection for the java component,that we use for our product.

Our Product==>send message to the JMS server using ActivemQ in order to execute Java Jobs.
if the activemq is disconnected the job execution  faile.
and we are getting this message specially when we don't have activity with the activemq.
like  a time out.
for exemple today i've got this message also,i think because there was no activity in the weekend. 

could you please advise., Need more information if we are to investigate this any further, broker logs, client logs, information on your config etc.  Not enough here to go on, looks like a normal client disconnect. , Not enough to go on here.]
