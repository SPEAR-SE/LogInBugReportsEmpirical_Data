[The problem is that a RAR is not a library that is used directly by end user apps. It's a deployment unit which would not have proper logging other JEE containers that don't support slf4j. The current setup is the correct default to work out of the box in most containers. You are free to modify the RAR if you don't like the default. , It will work out of the box without any logger bindings. It will just not log anything. If someone wants the log output, they can easily add the necessary binding to their classpath. The current default may work with a few, but not all containers. I find it very rude of RAR to clutter my classpath with a logger binding that I don't need and - even worse - that effectively disables my application's own logging.]
