[Patch attached. 

Changed IDispatcher to throw RejectedExecutionException when a request for dispatch is made when it is shutdown. Also modified DispatchContext.requestDispatch to do the same. Modified FlowController to catch and eat this exception. Also changed AbstractPooledDispatcher to keep better track of it's open dispatchers to avoid the ArrayIndexOutOfBounds exception, and changed MockBrokerTest to immediately start the dispatcher after its creation

There are still issues with the mock broker test shutdown sequence that will need to be addressed, but this should , Attached patch, patch applied in rev 746363 thx!]
