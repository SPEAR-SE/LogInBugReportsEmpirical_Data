[Without looking at it more I am not entirely sure why the context stuff was designed this way but I don't really think this is an issue.  The SSL context is properly set and then the transport is created so it uses the proper settings.  After the transport is created then it's set to the old value but I don't think that value is referenced anymore so it shouldn't matter. ]
