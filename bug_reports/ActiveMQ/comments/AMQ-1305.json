[Actually this spelling is correct against the code.  The SubscriptionInfo command in activemq-core has the subscription name spelled subcriptionName, and since the code uses reflection to find the property with this name, if you set it as activemq.subscriptionName it wouldn't work., Then this problem is more serious than I thought. The bug should be shifted from documentation to code, and the importance upgraded from trivial  to normal.

Of course the documentation should not be fixed until the code is fixed, but in the meantime it wouldn't hurt to  explicitly call out the misspelling in the documentation., Fixed by SVN revision 561109]
