[Have you tested using a v5.7.0 broker or a v5.8-SNAPSHOT?  There's been a great deal of work done to harden the KahaDB code since v5.6.0, I didn't see the error anymore...no additional info to claim it's solved., User has not reproduced it, newer versions have had a lot of hardening.  Reopen if it occurs on a later release. ]
