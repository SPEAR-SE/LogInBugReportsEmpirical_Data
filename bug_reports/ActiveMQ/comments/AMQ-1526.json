[Commenting out the *<authorizationPlugin>* section will allow the broker to start, although presumably authorization will be disabled., Apply principles implemented in AMQ-1237 to command agent and camel context (conf/credentials.properties support), I am facing the same error. Can sumone help me on this?, This issue is fixed by patch for https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1237

Please refer to http://activemq.apache.org/security.html#Security-SecurityandActiveMQComponents for details on workarounds for pre 5.3 releases., How can i put the patch to update my active mq version? Do i need to download the latest version? Currently i am using 4.1.0.]
