[Attaching a fix which updates the JUnit test. 
Initially the test was simply taking the thread count at the end of the test run and comparing it against the thread count in the beginning. The test failed if these counts did not match.

The new version now takes a list of all threads under the same main thread group at the end of the test run and removes any daemon threads from that list. 
This will filter out any additional threads created by the JVM. 
Then the count of that thread list is taken and compared against the initial thread count., Fixed in revision #1296194.]
