[Can you attach a screenshot., Its possible that the queues were each created with different trailing whitespace in the names.  There were a couple of fixes in 5.6 that related to that, so I'd recommend trying to upgrade to the 5.6.0 release to see if this prevents this from happening again., Need some sort of test case here to validate this.  Tests seem to indicate there's no problem here in the latest release., This appears to me to be a duplicate of: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3586]
