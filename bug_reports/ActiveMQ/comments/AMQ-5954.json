[I would suggest that it makes more sense to update the ActiveMQMessageTransformation#transformDestination to delegate to ActiveMQDestiantion#transform by default instead of having two destination transformation code paths., Commit e996dbe7c28d928c701daef6b3afd5770ae4c2ed in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5954
