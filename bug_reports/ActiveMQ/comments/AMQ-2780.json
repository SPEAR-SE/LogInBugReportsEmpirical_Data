[the command and arguments to invoke the two apps from maven to reproduce the problem:

mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.activemq.benchmark.Producer" -Dexec.args="tcp://127.0.0.1:61616 false queue/syncTopic false 64"

mvn -e exec:java -Dexec.mainClass="org.apache.activemq.benchmark.Consumer" -Dexec.args="tcp://127.0.0.1:61616 false queue/RemoteQ false 1 1"

Delay Set to:304 ms, violations:6, do the order violations happen around the time the delay ? , Unsure, I did not check to see if the order violation immediately followed the delay. I would guess that it doesn't because the sequence numbers from the violations are not near multiples of 100000., This might be the same as my newly-posted AMQ-2923., The priority message order in JMS is best attempt and not a guarantee that all messages will be ordered.  In some cases depending on when the message was sent and how fast the consumer is messages can and will arrive out of priority order., I am out of the office until 7/11/2011

, From the following doc:
http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-preserve-order-of-messages.html

Seems to imply that ActiveMQ does preserve message order? I was not processing based on priority from what I recall... just trying to get the messages received in the order they were sent.

Should your docs be updated to state that you do not preserve message order (best attempt) or am I not understanding something?, Attempt at creating a unit test that reproduces the issue using the supplied code as a starting point.  Could not reproduce., I tried to reproduce by creating a test case based on the sample code provided.  Was not able to reproduce after much trying.  If the reporter can modify the test case to produce the issue please reopen and attach the updates., I am out of the office until 10/10/2011
