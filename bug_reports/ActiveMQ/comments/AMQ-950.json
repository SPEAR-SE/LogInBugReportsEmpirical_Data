[Patch applied - many thanks Renaud.

BTW could you double check my version of your patch works - I only create a connector if result != null and createConnector is true.

Hi James,

this looks correct to me, however I can't play with the latest 4.1 snapshots because they break with servicemix-3.0 final
(something wrong with jencks and the RA). It broke in the last 3 weeks (snapshot from 20060830 works)., 
me again,

sorry, I meant to say that I plan to look into this issue with the latest snapshots - I don't have time right now but it is on my todo to provide more info on the problem I am seeing ;-)
