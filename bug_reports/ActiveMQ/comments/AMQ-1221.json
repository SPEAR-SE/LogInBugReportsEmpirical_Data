[Hi All,
    The test case given seems to be obsolete as it sends a text message and tries to typecast it to an object message. 
I have changed it to send an object message, and I could receive the message from the queue from a different machine. I used active mq 4.1.1 for testing.
Thanks,
Anish, Am not aware of the actual problem here. Either the messages are being cast to their incorrect types, or the de-serialization is not working due to classpath changes or class version changes. I don't see any ActiveMQ issue here.

If you can find an actual ActiveMQ issue, let us know and we can reopen this issue]
