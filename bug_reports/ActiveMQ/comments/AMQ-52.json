[Thought I'd give this one to you since you're looking at Howl & your logger. I think this is just an issue that the log runs out of space, Created a new Journal abstraction API that is implemented by the HOWL logger and a custom ActiveMQ logger.  

Created a new JournalPersistenceAdapter that uses the new Journal API.  This new JournalPersistenceAdapter coupled with the custome ActiveMQ logger now does not suffer from overflows., Forgot to select which version this fix will be in.]
