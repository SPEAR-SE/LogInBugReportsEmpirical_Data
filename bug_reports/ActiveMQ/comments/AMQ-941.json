[There's not really a whole lot to go on with this issue. What was your heap? Did you try just increasing your heap? Am not even sure this is a bug, Am closing this down until we get some more detail. e.g. the dump of the objects looks fine; with 620 messages in RAM with an average of about 67K each. Seems fine. Just set a bigger heap - or reduce the prefetch size to 1.

http://activemq.apache.org/what-is-the-prefetch-limit-for.html, I think this issue was addressed by Hiram changing the default size on
the openwire cache from 16000 down to something reasonable. See
AMQ-1001. What I remember seeing was an array of 16000 objects with
only 1 or 2 slots used (the rest null) which took up 64k per array (4
bytes per obj ref even if null).
