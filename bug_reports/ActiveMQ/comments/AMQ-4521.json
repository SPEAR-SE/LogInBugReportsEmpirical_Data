[TCP_KEEPCNT, TCP_KEEPIDLE, and TCP_KEEPINTVL are not accessible for Java based apps, you need to set them on the OS.

STOMP client's using v1.1 and up can use STOMP defined heart-beat messages to test the connection.  The Broker supports this and its generally a better solution than relying on TCP keepalive , To set the value on the connected transport i.e. the one that's created for each incoming client connection and not the actual Broker side server socket use "?transport.keepAlive=true", transport.keepAlive=true along with transport.soLinger=30 work as expected. netstat command shows keepalive being enabled on the sockets with these options.

Thank you for the clarification.]
