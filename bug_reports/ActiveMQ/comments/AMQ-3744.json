[activemq.test.zip contains an unit test which demonstrates the maloperation, Tried to run your test, gives an error: "Could not resolve dependencies for project de.mgo:activemq.test:jar:0.0.1-SNAPSHOT:", I added the fusesource repositoy to the pom.xml. So it should work.
The test fails with ActiveMQ 5.5.1-fuse-02-02 and runs successful with 5.5.1-fuse-00-08, Tested against latest 5.6 SNAPSHOT and the test case passes without error.]
