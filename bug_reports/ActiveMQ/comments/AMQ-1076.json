[I have unit tests that are related to this issue. In a network of brokers offline durable subscribers don't get messages produced during the time they are offline. You should be able to put it under package test/org/apache/activemq/usecases and run them

I have deleted the unit tests as there was a bug in them...so it does not apply here]
