[Commit 8363c99b51a98eb176e6baea82fcafce3225ba2c in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]
[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=8363c99 ]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6069

Fixed contains method in PrioritizedPendinList which was not returning
correctly.  This was causing messages to not be removed from the
dispatchPendingList when purge was called inside a Queue leading to an
eventual OOM error if enough messages were purged. This fix also
improves performance of the contains method.

, Fix and test applied.  The dispatchedPendingList now properly clears out messages during a purge., This is a similar fix to AMQ-6066 so this also improves performance.]
