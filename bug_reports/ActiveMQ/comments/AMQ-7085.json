[Hi - just curious if there is any feedback for this issue?  Thanks. , [~sits] even for a small change, it is best to include a test case to validate the use case and to protect your change into the future. It also makes it easy to integrate b/c the bug becomes trivial to understand with the test case in code., Fair enough.. I've added two tests which demonstrate the fix.  Many thanks.
