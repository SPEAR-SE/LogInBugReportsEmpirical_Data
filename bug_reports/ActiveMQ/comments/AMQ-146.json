[Added test case: 


http://cvs.activemq.codehaus.org/viewrep/activemq/activemq/modules/core/src/test/org/codehaus/activemq/JmsTempDestinationTest.java?r=1.3#l148, Fixed., The one thing to look out for now is that the ConnectionFactory used to create the connection needs to be configured with userAsyncSend=false.

This due to the send opperation needing to wait for the broker to report if the send operation succeeded or not.  If you are using Async sends, the client does not wait for the broker to get the message and therefore it will not get the expected exception., Changed the default value of useAsyncSend to false so that by default you get a spec compliant implementation., BTW one way of fixing this even for async sending is to distribute all the valid temporary queue names per connection on a broker to each client - and distributing when a connection closes, so that attempts to send to a non-existent connection/destintation can throw an immediate exception even while being an async send.]
