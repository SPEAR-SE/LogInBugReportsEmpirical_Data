[Do you have logs from the times when this happening, is there anything in them to give more insight?  Have you tried with a newer broker release, latest is v5.6.0, We had further investigations and we found this happens when the CPU usage goes up due to some other process in server (it reaches around 50%. We have an Sun V880 server with four 1.2 GHz CPUs with 8MB cache). We hadn't tried new versions due to hard update procedure. Is it possible that this problem is solved in newer versions?, No test case, and no logs.  Recommend you try a newer version as AMQ 5.4.2 is quite old now. ]
