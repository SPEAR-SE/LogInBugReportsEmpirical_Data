[I seem to be able to reproduce the problem by connecting and consuming all messages and then disconnecting, then let a few messages pile up, then run browseMessages and it will return the proper list at this point. Once more messages come in, however, the browseMessages operation will continue to get only the list of messages it retrieved during the previous run. This behavior continues until a consumer connects and begins consuming messages. , Correction: you do not need to consume any messages in order for the correctly sized list to be returned by the browseMessages operation again. As a work around I tried connecting and setting up a consumer but then immediately closing that consumer and that seems to be enough of a wake up call to fix the functionality of operation. Kind of ineffecient and bad design tho... , ok i was wrong again: connecting to the queue but not consuming messages does not reliably work around this issue. I'm not excited about the fact that this operation is basically useless. , No test case provided to allow the problem to be tested and reproduced.]
