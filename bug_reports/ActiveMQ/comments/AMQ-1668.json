[please attach a junit test case., Hi, I'm new to the community.

I've tested the ActiveMQQueueBrowser with a sample of 1000 messages.
 - 5.1.0, it browses only the same first 100 messages each time I run the test
 - 5.3.0, it browses all messages every time, then it's OK.
 - trunk, it browses only the first 200 messages.

So, is there a setting anywhere ? Or it is a problem ?

I've uploaded a test case.
I want to help you.

Thanks., Seems the ActiveMQPrefetchPolicy.setQueueBrowserPrefetch(int queueBrowserPrefetch) does not affect the behaviour., trunk is correct, the limit is maxBrowsePageSize (default 200) which can be set on a destination policy. The limit is necessary to ensure that a browse of a deep destination does not use all available memory as all browsed messages are loaded into memory. Increase this limit to 1000 and you should see all messages on trunk., similar issue. maxBrowsePageSize Policy entry is applicable to both., Working as designed.  Browse limit in place to prevent deep queue scans.  Configuration change can address this issue.]
