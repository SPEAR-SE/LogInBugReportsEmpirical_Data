[I am attaching a possible fix for this bug. 
When setting producer.sessTransacted|consumer.sessionTransacted it will commit the transaction.

I further introduced a new configuration property called commitAfterXMsgs which tells after how many msgs to commit the transaction (as opposed to after every msg). This property defaults to 1 and is only used in conjunction with a transaction.

So two new properties that need to be documented:

producer.commitAfterXMsgs
consumer.commitAfterXMsgs

Once the patch is merged, I can update the plugin docs.
, Patch applied with svn revision 1092753, Thanks!]
