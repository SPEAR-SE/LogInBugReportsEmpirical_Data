[Guess its the queue of the virtual topic thats forwarding the message , In which case the entry  <queue physicalName="Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.>"/> in excluded destinations is not working .
I have also tried adding the entry <queue physicalName="Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.InCluster.>"/> to the list of excluded destinations , But was not helping either., I believe we are seeing this issue too. Has it been confirmed to exist? Is there an ETA for when it will be fixed?, Not test case provided to reproduce the issue]
