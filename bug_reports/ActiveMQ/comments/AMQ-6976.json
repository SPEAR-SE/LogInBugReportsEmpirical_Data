[The TransportConnectionState objects are added with a new connection and then removed when the connection is removed inside the TransportConnection class.  Are you creating a lot of new connections and then not closing them properly?  You will probably need to do some more debugging to see why there are so many connection state objects being created and not removed.  I would start with https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/activemq-5.15.3/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/TransportConnection.java

It might also help to look at a thread dump to make sure nothing is stuck., We are using the RAR Connection Pool approach and therefore the connections will stay open "forever" and are reused by several processes. May this be a problem? , It could be something to do with that but I personally haven't looked too much at how the RAR pool was designed or setup.  I would take a closer look at how the RAR stuff is configured and see if you can tune it to not create so many connections or to maybe identify a bug somewhere with the connections not being properly removed., We figured out that we were using several connection factories for different queues/topics together with the "is-same-rm-override" flag NOT set.
If we enable this flag by setting it to false, everything works fine. 
Another solution would be to use the same connection factory for all queues and topics.
