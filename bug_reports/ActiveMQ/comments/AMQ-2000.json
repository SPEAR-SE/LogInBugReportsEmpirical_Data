[It looks like the correct version of all the necessary libraries either does not exist on the second system or a different version is already on the CLASSPATH and being picked up by ActiveMQ. Do you have a CLASSPATH environment variable already configured on the second system that contains an older version of the servlet tag lib? , Thank for the help. I looked over the installation and found a jar file in the path.
Even though others around here swear they didn't do anything to the new install.

Anyway it started fine now.

Thanks.

Pat, User resolved issue on his end. ]
