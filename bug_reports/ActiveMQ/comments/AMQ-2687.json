[Looks like the btree index became inconsistent.  Access logic looks ok, so I'm suspecting it was the btree update logic that may be at fault.  To help me narrow down the search for the culprit.. could you let us what you were doing /w the broker and how you stopped it?  Were you only producing?  producing and consuming?  Did you stop it with a kill -9 or did you power off the box? etc. etc.
, I was running both a producer and a consumer - both working in a queue that had roughly 300.000 messages. I then executed a "prune" on that queue... saw it executing for a while (it had erased a few thousand messages already), clicked on "delete" (for the same queue), saw the Webconsole hang/stop responding and did a kill -9 in the Java process. After that the queue would no longer start.

Let me know if you need any more info, help, or want me to reproduce it again., found a bug in how the recovery log was loaded and applied.  The net effect was that it was never applied because it was always considered inconsistent. Fixed in rev 932537 in trunk.
It's a long shot, but it might just fix the issue.  Igor, if you get a chance could you get a trunk update and see if the situation improves?, Not further reports from the user, closing this.  Reopen if there is still a problem.]
