[Stopped using DMLC and wrote my own JmsConsumer using the jms message listener interface,
probably a bug in springs DMLC, Why is it closed ? "Not A Problem", watch my reply above, 
after removing the DMLC component that consumes messages from activemq and implementing my own solution, the problem described above does not persist anymore.
