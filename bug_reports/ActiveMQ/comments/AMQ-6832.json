[For now you can either create your own JAAS broker plugin or extend the existing one.
Take a look at: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/activemq-5.15.1/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/security/JaasAuthenticationBroker.java

You could extend that class, override the removeConnection() method and then add a call to logout().

Also if you wanted to take a shot as fixing this contributions are always welcome.]
