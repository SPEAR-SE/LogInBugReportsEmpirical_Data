[I believe you need to add the jetty-jaas jar file to the classpath.  The JAAS related classes were moved into their own jar file in the newer versions of jetty.

{code:xml}
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.jetty</groupId>
  <artifactId>jetty-jaas</artifactId>
  <version>${jetty-version}</version>
</dependency>
{code}, Hi Chris,

I tried adding JAAS jar in classpath. It is still not getting picked loaded in the classpath. Do you have any recommendation where to place this JAR and where to add in the activeMQ start up script

, I haven't tried it but I would think that you could just put the jar file under the same directory as the jetty-all jar file.  If you explode the distribution it is under lib/web directory.   I'm closing this ticket out as not a problem...if you still need more help the best place to get it would be to use the user's mailing list for questions.]
