[Fixed with svn revision 993322.

It'd be great if you could test this new script in your environment, The fix applied does not work on all Solaris installations as /ucr/ucb is not part of the minimal installation bundle.

My suggestion to replace the who am I or whoami is:

`who am i | cut -d " " -f 1`
From my tests this is platform independend, and for Solaris you can set the application user easy by setting it in activemq.xml from AMQ-2907 Solaris 10 SMF manifest
