[Fixed with svn revision 1363790

The client thread pool is now limited to 1000 by default and it could be further tuned with 

{code}ActiveMQConnectionFactory.setMaxThreadPoolSize(){code}

You can also provide a completely custom task runner factory using

{code}ActiveMQConnectionFactory.setSessionTaskRunner(){code}

As for the rejection policy, we decided to let it as is since it's appropriate to raise an exception when you reach your limits, so that things can be tuned further.

We also left SingleQueue as LinkedBlockingQueue is unbounded which can cause problems on its own.

Current changes should be enough to make clients scale.]
