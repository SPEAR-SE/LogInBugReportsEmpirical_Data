[I've verified that the problem seems to be present both in 5.5.1 and the current trunk (5.8-SNAPSHOT). Based on the SVN history I'm fairly certain it's present in 5.6 and 5.7 as well., Simplified the proposed solution a bit by removing the read-write lock and readded the reloadtime-check that was missing in the last changeset., You should create and attach patch files for your test case and proposed fix for review. , Coming right up. I've attached two patches, one containing the testcase and one containing the proposed fix., Nice investigation, patch applied to trunk.]
