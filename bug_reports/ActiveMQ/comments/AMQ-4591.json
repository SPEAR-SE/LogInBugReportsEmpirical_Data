[Patch to handle the cronEntry "* * * * *", Can you link to appropriate documentation that states that the intended behavior of the "* * * * *" entry is current time + 60 seconds instead of the top of every minute. , No, what I tried to mean, is that the current behaviour with the current code on SVN is that the next schedule time is the current time + 60 seconds for the pattern "* * * * *".
But the correct behaviour, must have to be, to calculate the top of the next minute.

If you look at the code:
https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/trunk/activemq-client/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/scheduler/CronParser.java

The issue is at the line 47:

            result = result / 1000 * 1000;
 
the previous formula, sets the precision to "seconds", so, if the current time is 00:01:40, de next scheduled time will be 00:02:40
That is not correct, because the next scheduled time must have to be the top of the next minute.
So, to calculate the top of the next minute, the previous formula must have to be:

            result = result / 60000 * 60000;



That is the why I proposed to following patch:

, Fixed on trunk, thanks for the patch. ]
