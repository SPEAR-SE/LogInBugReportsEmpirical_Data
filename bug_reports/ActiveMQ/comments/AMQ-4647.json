[Have you tried your test against a 5.9-SNAPSHOT there's a lot of bugfixes in there. , No, this is a production system and I am unable to reproduce in test at the moment.

Which of the bugs fixed in the 5.9-SNAPSHOT do you believe this issue is related to?, Not sure there's a specific issue to address this but we need a test of some sort to reproduce, so if you can create one then its a good idea to test against the latest snapshot as there are a lot of fixes for other issues in there and one of them might just resolve whatever you are seeing.  , Some candidates AMQ-4212 AMQ-4548 AMQ-2832, requested test case not provided.]
