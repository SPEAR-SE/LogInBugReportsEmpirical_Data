[Thanks for the report, I was able to reproduce this pretty easy.  This is a little tricky because we can't really add synchronization between the getQueues query and the actual getName() method call where it fails because many asynchronous processes can delete destinations.

It seems like the best thing to do here is to just catch the InstanceNotFoundException and continue checking the rest of the destinations in the list.  If the destination that was being queried was the one deleted then null would be returned which is the same behavior one would expect normally.

I can fix this when I get a chance and I can look at the rest of the class to see if there are any other areas with the same problem., Commit ac3d088647cacfe298a61ba5b9f1b3941249142d in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~christopher.l.shannon]
