[I found that if I make the org.apache.activemq.broker.SslContext methods getSSLContext() and setSSLContext(SSLContext sslContext) synchronized, the problem goes away.

I'm not going to submit a patch because it's possible the original intent of whoever maintains the SslContext class was for the users of that class to use getCurrentSslContext() and setCurrentSslContext(SslContext bs) instead (because the "current" SSLContext is wrapped by ThreadLocal).  , https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=8bb3a77270775e69c1053ed789c5a1999cae2f51]
