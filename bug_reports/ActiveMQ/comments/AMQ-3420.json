[These warnings have been around for a while but typically they are just that, warnings, they are not a problem.
There is some config that works as part of: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2212, The RAR has been improved/fixed in 5.9 release. Can you try with that?, Also the log is only a WARN, not an error. So something else is maybe wrong.]
