[With the latest update on trunk, I have the following result on activemq-amqp tests:

Failed tests:   testTXConsumerAndLargeNumberOfMessages(org.apache.activemq.transport.amqp.JMSClientTest): Should receive message: 191
, As discussed in earlier email, the problem here is the way we were using delivery tags.  
, Patch applied, tests passing now.  Thanks!]
