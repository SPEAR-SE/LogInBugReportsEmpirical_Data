[I've added a fix for this issue in rev 475901.

BTW, if we are going to move to Java 1.5, are we still going to use mx4j or the jmx implementation of java 1.5?

JMX supposedly has this query mechanism to perform better object name querying and I want to use that instead of the regex thing. Last time I checked though, mx4j doesn't seem to support it, so I want to check if Java 1.5 has or the recent mx4j version has it. I'll keep this JIRA open to remind., I might as well commit add this in the 4.1 branch also. :), Fix added to 4.1 branch via r475929]
