[Added code to synchronize on a mutex before accessing that variable., I never tried it before, but when I passed -1 to sleep you get an exception as apposed to sleeping forever. So the -1 call to sleep wasn't my issue (still a spot for RuntimeException). 

Next I assumed the value was very large. 

I set the value of the flowControlSleeptime to a local variable to keep the other thread from stomping it and logged the value if it was > 10. I saw a few 1000s, and then a huge number (sleep for many years). 

I hacked it to set the value back to 50 in that case and the stress works fine. 

I suspect the issue is on the broker sending the CapcityInfo object. 
, fixed.]
