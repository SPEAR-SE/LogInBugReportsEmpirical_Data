[This issue should be in the Message Store component, I believe. Also, in order to upload, I had to get rid of the exploded stuff and includes necessary to build the jar and deploy as well, but they are run of the mill log4j, activemq, and j2ee jars, and the activemq rar. I am investigating this problem further, so please let me know if I can provide any more info that would assist in reproducing the bug., This is the possible patch to fix this bug., I have attached a patch file to this bug. Please review/commit/resolve.
Thanks,
Eldon
