[Unit test is available., You might want to look into other more proven methods of transferring files such as FTP, Camel has a nice FTP component.  You could also try using the BlobMessage provided by ActiveMQ.  , I believe there are no easy solutions for this issue and it's better to clarify/warn the risk of using JMS Stream on the page[1].
Because the above proven solutions are available JMS Stream feature perhaps can be deprecated.


[1]http://activemq.apache.org/jms-streams.html, It maybe a way to mark the messages from jms-stream and delay to delete them on broker-side util all messages will be received by consumer., Yeah I wonder if we should mark this jms streams as @deprecated.?, Yeah we are deprecating this functionality.]
