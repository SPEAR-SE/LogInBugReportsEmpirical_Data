[This sounds to me like this is the correct behavior of the failover transport by default.  The reconnect logic is going to rapidly try and connect over and over again unless you tune it to slow down and that is probably what is spiking your cpu so high.  

For tuning, you can try setting reconnectDelay or initialReconnectDelay to something longer.  The default initialReconnectelay is only 10 ms.  You can also try playing around with exponential back off and enable useExponentialBackOff which should lower your cpu usage.  See http://activemq.apache.org/failover-transport-reference.html for all of the configuration options., Given the configuration this appears to be a non-issue, failover and network reconnection logic going to kick in here and cause a spike which can be controlled by configuring delay and backoff on the failover bits.  ]
