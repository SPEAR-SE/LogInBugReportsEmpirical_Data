[This is biting us as well now.

Am I missing something, or is this major issue unresolved for about a year now?, Hello all,

I can confirm the issue (tested with AMQ 5.15.3 on Postgres 10.3 + postgresql-42.2.2.jar).

I can also confirm the solution provided by the file attached by the OP.

As far as I can see - this could be +_easily_+ closed - can we expect the fix to be included in the next version ?

Thank you.

Bye!]
