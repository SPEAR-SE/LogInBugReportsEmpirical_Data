[The options that are prefixed "transport." are applied only when a new client connection arrives on that connector so the broker would always start cleanly regardless of incorrect transport level parameters.  It is possible to have it log some warnings about the not applied options on connect but I wouldn't fail the connect just for that reason.  , [~tabish121]
As you mentioned that

     It is possible to have it log some warnings about the not applied options on connect but I wouldn't fail the connect just for that reason.
{code}

   Why cant the Warning message appear in the broker log immediately as soon as the broker is started with an incorrect option.  That will help the Broker Admin to proactively fix the transport option if anything is incorrectly set there,  Rather than  waiting for the consumers/producers to connect to the broker.

Use Case:  
-------------   Suppose tomorrow morning is production launch (broker admin assumes that he has configured everything fine) and thousands of consumers / producers will try to connect to the broker.  The Broker admin will not know that there is something wrong (like incorrect transport option is set  or may be a Typo mistake) until those producer/consumers try to connect to the broker. , Because the transport options are only lazily applied on an actual connect attempt by a client, there is no Transport instance prior to that to test them on as they are applied via reflection.  ]
