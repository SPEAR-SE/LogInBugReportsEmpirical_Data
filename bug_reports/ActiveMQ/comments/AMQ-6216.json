[Update: after I simply restart the node which I manually shut down, infinite log from above becomes like this:{code}leveldb.replicated.MasterLevelDBStore | ActiveMQ BrokerService[localhost] Task-2

Plus my client which was sending lot of messages to the queue is ab;e to reconnect (because it's using "failover" protocol).

I assume this is related to intense data input to the master node which can't get copied to slaves in time due to master shut down. But I think this should be robust enough to survive not only manual master shutdowns, but also immediate master loss like during network failure. But I maybe just doing something wrong here... Could you please advise?, LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
