[There is not enough information here for anyone to know what the issue is you are reporting. , Hi Timothy 

I created requestor and replyer send/receive to activemq. Regularly my requestor get null message.

I traced log in server I saw temporary queue have purge 

That causes some requests lost.

, But if I used session.createqueue (); instead of createtemqueue() it work well. But using this way when I browse queue on Web admin I saw lots of queues., Please create a JUnit test case that reproduces the problem
, Hi Timothy,

I try to implement Requets/Response as this example http://activemq.apache.org/how-should-i-implement-request-response-with-jms.html

It work well with single broker but my environment used network broker as Load Balancing,
the problem when client try to send/received bulk message there are some message received null, 

, Without a test case to reproduce a problem there's not much to be done.  It is actually possible in many cases that a consumer receive call can return null so your code would need to account for that. , No test case provided for debugging. ]
