For non static discovery of networks or client connections, parameters that need to be applied to all discovered uris should be specified on the discovery uri using the prefix "discovered.".
Static discovery just adds the parameters in the normal way., Gary, contrary to your comment on 21/Mar/11, I found that I could only set socketBufferSize for the underlying transports in a static: discovery URI when prefixing with "discovered.", just as you say I would need to do for a failover: discovery URI.

My working URI, for ActiveMQ 5.8.0:
static:(tcp://hostname:port)?discovered.socketBufferSize=2498560

Can you please clarify your comment to explain how query parameters should be applied to the static discovery transport and/or to the underlying discovered transports within those static discovery transports?, I would expect{code}static:(tcp://hostname:port?socketBufferSize=2498560){code} to work also. The discovered. option to static will work too, but in the static case there is only one url to augment.]
