[I have seen exact same issue with my ActiveMQ broker (5.10). It looks like a bug, Can someone please take a look here ?, I'm having similar issues with corruption in AMQ.  could you upload your code for testing?  I can then test it to see if I have similar behavior.  

I may be wrong I think your problem is that it CAN NOT recover in your situation because the log has been deleted and it has no index to start from.

It should print a better message though., fix and test in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/b54606b1, Hi Good day,

It seems this issue is not fixed as I have been able to replicated on Replicated Level DB and the lastest 5.11 snapshot. The levelDB corrupts even at the point that every time I kill current master the next slave to take the position starts doing the infinite loop. The only way to fix this is to delete the leveldb data from all ActiveMQ instances which obviously lets me without messages. I find this issue to be quite critical as it occurs even on graceful shut downs of ActiveMQ.

I have a attached a copy of the logs and my levelDB directory. (If all messages on the Queue look the same is because they are, for testing purposes i send the same message over and over)

My settings are:
Ubuntu 14.04 64bit
leveldb jin linux-x64

            <replicatedLevelDB
                    directory="${mailSystem.activeMQ.rebDB}"
                    replicas="3"
                    sync="local_mem"
                    logSize="25413000"
                    indexCompression="none"
                    zkAddress="lstkmy90430:2181,lstkmy36606:2181,lstkmy52108:2181"
                    zkPath="/activemq/leveldb-stores"
                    />

, Since this is resolved and specifically mentiones LevelDB, I've opened another issue for Replicated LevelDB: AMQ-5618]
