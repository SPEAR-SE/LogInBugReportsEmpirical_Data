[This is a simple test case that reproduces the issue., Could this be fixed also in 5.8 (5.8.1)? We have already deployed 5.8 brokers in production and we would like to use the auto rebalance features.
, The next planned release is 5.9.0, no other 5.8.0 are planned. , When do you think 5.9 will be released? 5.8 brokers will be compatible with 5.9 clients? Thanks in advance., 1. When its ready.
2. They should work together but we generally recommend you upgrade to matching versions ASAP. , Fixed on trunk. , Hi Timothy, It looks that I've found another issue when you have an HA pair with shared storage, this time is failing to failover even if updateClusterClientsOnRemove=false. Could you please point me to your HA test cases so I can try to reproduce it there (I couldn't find them)?

Probably the changes to this bug fixes the issue I just found, but I want to have a test case so we make sure is fixed in 5.9.
