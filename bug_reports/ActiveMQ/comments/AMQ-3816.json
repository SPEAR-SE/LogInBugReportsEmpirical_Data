[What could be happening here is that your consumer is using an ack mode of auto, and the broker has sent the consumer all the pending messages because its prefetch limit has not been set.  You should try setting the prefetch limit to 1, or using client ack.  , @Timothy

I have tried with 'client' ack mode as well and also tried by setting prefetch limit to 1 but I'm still seeing this issue.

Can you please check this?, Recommend you try and create a JUnit test that demonstrates the issue, testing here indicates that things are working as expected., @Timothy did you test this case with Perl code? I personally feel that there are some differences in Perl and Java STOMP implementations and some issues (like this one) might be real issues only in Perl STOMP clients., Problem ActiveMQ can't be responsible for client code that we didn't write, and a perl module wouldn't go into the unit tests to ensure that anything that did get fixed stayed fixed in the future.  I haven't had time to look any further at this but from the testing I did I could not find any issues on the broker side.  You can use the numerous test cases already present in AMQ to try to create something that reproduces your problem if you want to contribute.  , Couldn't reproduce this.]
