[IIRC then producer flow control will kick in. Paging out to disk only happens when 100% of the memoryLimit are used. At that same time producer flow control will kick in as well because of the 100% limit being reached. Paging to disk will only occur if producer flow control is disabled. 
But I presume the limit at which paging to disk happens may be configurable., I ran the same thing with PFC turned off. VisualVM shows MemoryPercentUsage on the topic steadily rise to 100%, then drop to 0%. No further messages are dequeued or enqueued.

Only difference to earlier attached config was:

<policyEntry topic=">" producerFlowControl="false" memoryLimit="1mb">, I modified the test case testFillTempAndConsume in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/bugs/TempStorageBlockedBrokerTest.java?view=markup&pathrev=1233367 to use a topic instead of a queue and it failed.

Is this the same issue?, From posting on the mailing list I found that I needed to add setting the topic prefetch policy on my connection factories to enable temp storage with topics and non-persistent messages so my previous comment was incorrect., Whats the status of this ticket?]
