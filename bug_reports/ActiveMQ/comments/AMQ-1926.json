[fixed in revision 691621

problem: allocated data locations not used because ack received before async write can complete were remaining in memory in the inProgressDataFile map, hence preventing cleanup.  Fix is to remove the reference when message is removed if message still exists when ack is received. At that stage it should normally be stored.]
