[Same problem on activemq 5.2.0 running on opensolaris server 
message producer is running on the same server publishing messages on topic with time to live set to 30000
message consumer was tested both on windows xp client and linux box client... not even single message was recieved

on contrary
both message producer and consumer running on windows xp with the same settings work just fine..

I think the problem is in message producer code when it's running on unix type operating system, Hi Dmitry,

have you checked that the time on your machine is synchronized? If not there is a high chance that the message expires before the other machine can get  it. Then you will never be able to receive it.

ActiveMQSession.send(..) does the following to determine the expiration : 
expiration = timeToLive + System.currentTimeMillis();


Cheers,
Felix
, i my case i don't have syncrhonized the machines, because producers, consumers and brokers (broker network) runs in differents countriesand are administrated by different people.
I am trying to find where the broker does the control for message expiration  (timeToLive) for MessageListener., You should set the  timestamp on messages on your broker by using the TimeStampBrokerPlugin - 
http://activemq.apache.org/maven/activemq-core/apidocs/org/apache/activemq/broker/util/TimeStampingBrokerPlugin.html

see http://activemq.apache.org/interceptors.html for info on how to set a broker interceptor]
