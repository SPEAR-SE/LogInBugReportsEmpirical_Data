[Seems to have gone wrong in branches/activemq-4.1/pom.xml rev 642422 
The dependency version was changed from use of property to 1.1.1, property with value 1.0 still there unused:

- <dependency>
  <groupId>org.apache.geronimo.specs</groupId> 
  <artifactId>geronimo-jms_1.1_spec</artifactId> 
  <version>1.1.1</version> 
  </dependency>

....

<org-apache-geronimo-specs-version>1.0</org-apache-geronimo-specs-version> 

Version should be 1.0, "geronimo jms spec" was not the only jar build with 1.5. Please try out the next version by running it with real java 1.4., Throw out you java1.4
It is java6 today. I think it is bad idea to keep old trash, This is not a problem for amq 5.x+ which uses at least java 5.  I doubt anyone is going to release a new amq 4.x so perhaps we should close this as won't fix?, Not relevant on version 5]
