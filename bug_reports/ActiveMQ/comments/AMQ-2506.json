[Is this really wrong? Check out the test case that validates the config setting. org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanConfigTest
It fails with the patch. There may be cases where topic dispatch order is important. Advisories in a network scenario for example can be more deterministic.  Am not sure if this is really a bug in the doc.
If it really is then the corresponding test needs to change but it looks ok to me.]
