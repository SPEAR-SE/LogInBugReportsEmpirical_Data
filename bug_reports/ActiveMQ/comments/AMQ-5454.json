[If I used Queues instead of Topics, everything works fine., This should be retested against the latest release., do you have a stack trace with a npe from the log or a test case?
As part of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6070 I added a fix for the case of a message expiring before dispatch by setting the regionDestination earlier. A stack trace would help identify if that fix resolved this., Commit 88ec9dad9dc47790a3fc4e0f5ad939ea5530dad7 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5454 https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6070 - in the case of duplicates from the store the regiondestination was not set
, I think I found the problem. It would be great if you could provide a test case to validate or validate the 5.14 snapshot.
If you still see a problem, please include the logging information, Commit c67590104b0836906b0701c641eabb6e66989da6 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~gtully]
