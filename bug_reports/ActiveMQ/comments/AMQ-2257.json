[A modified patch applied. Thanks., Modification patch looks great.  Thanks for the help!, After downloading ActiveMQ trunk, I've been unable to build because of the missing apache-protobuf dependency.  I've look around for the apache-protbuf snapshot and haven't been able to find it anywhere.  From the previous resolution and posts around the net, it looks like it was hosted on this server last year,
    https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/
However, I cannot find apache-protobuf on this or any other maven repository.  Any help would be appreciated.  Thanks!, I just triggered a new build of protobuf module. You can find snapshots here: 

https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/protobuf/activemq-protobuf/1.1-SNAPSHOT/

Please let us know if it works for you, Thank you for the very prompt response.  I verified that the files are now on repository.apache.org.  

Unfortunately, I'm now having trouble connecting to repository.apache.org.  I've tried importing the site certificate to a keystore without any success.  Adding -Djavax.net.debug=ssl:handshake:data to MAVEN_OPTS reveals that the certificate is correctly being retrieved, but I'm still getting a connection timed out exception.  I've checked that the proxy configuration is correct too.  Any other hints?  

I'm resolving this issue as the activemq-protobuf 1.1 snapshot is now available and I'm just having issues connecting to the server. , Resolved as activemq-protobuf 1.1 snapshot is now available here,
