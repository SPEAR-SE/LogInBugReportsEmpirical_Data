[Have you tested with the latest release v5.12.1 ?, I was looking at AMQ-4239 and indeed - I am doing PURGEs between tests from frontend. So it might be related to the Purge. I will try to test with 5.12.1, Yes. I was not able to reproduce this yet. Looks like it was fixed. I think we can close this issue., Reported as not reproducible on a newer broker.]
