[Please post a full configuration file so we can see what you actually doing. , Added the current config (without failover)., If you are adding the failover bit to the transportConnector URI then that is your problem, failover is for client side and in some cases network connector configuration., OK, thanks for that - Was reading this - http://activemq.apache.org/failover-transport-reference.html - which has really kind of lead me to think this is a transport connection configuration option. But of course now it makes sense.]
