[problem is that on a duplicate connection, for instance on failover but when the broker has not yet disposed of its connection info, it is possible to get a duplicate connection request. the state is reset to have the second connection take over which is ok, but the default session is not recreated on the reset state so the submission of the advisory consumer fails with no session., resolved in r771718, similar behavior can also be the result of AMQ-2178]
