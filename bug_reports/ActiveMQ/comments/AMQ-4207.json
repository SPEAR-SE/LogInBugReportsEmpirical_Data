[Can you produce a unit test to reproduce?, I cannot think of a way to reproduce it in unit test. It happens rarely., I'm guessing here that you have one thread that's calling the rollback and another that's calling the close of the Session., This appears to be a case of multi threaded access to a Session which is a single threaded resource.  If you can produce a test case or provide more details we can investigate but as it stands I don't see a real issue here. ]
