[you have got to provide some more information. 
Enable debug logging and interrogate the logs on B1 to 1) see that it sees the network disconnect, 2) starts to reconnect with some backoff.
Attache the relevant snippits of the log files from B1 and B2. 
Do you see the exact same behavior with static and mulitcast. Again, logs from both would help., Here is a zipped archive which contains logs for both brokers concerning this issue. There is also included a test project which we used to reproduce this bug. After the plug is reconnected, the brokers seem to find eachother, but messages are no longer received on the clients. Same behavior seems to happen with multicasted dynamic brokers., We noticed that this issue seems to appear only with persistent topics. Persistent queues seem to recover fine, except that message fifo ordering is not preserved on recovery. Nonpersistent topics also seemed to recover. We also tried topics with TimedSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy, and they also seemed to recover.]
