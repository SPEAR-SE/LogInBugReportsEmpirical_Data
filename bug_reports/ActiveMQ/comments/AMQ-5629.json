[Recommend you create a unit test or enhance one of the existing one to show your issue., A String value can in fact not be read as a char as per the MapMessage conversion table.  If did however fix the error message to state the correct type.  , I stand corrected - I just looked sideways, but that is the other way: A Char can be read as String, but a String cannot be read as a char. Pretty annoying, as it certainly makes it slightly more problematic to make a manual copy of a MapMessage, since you cannot check for the type of a key before reading it., You have to use getObject / setObject to manually copy a MapMessage's contents. , Thanks a bunch, I *just* realized and was about to amend my comment!]
