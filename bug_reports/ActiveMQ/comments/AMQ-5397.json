[You might want to try out the 5.11-SNAPSHOT builds and see if the problem is still there.  If so it would be great if you could create a test case for this, possibly add one to MQTTAuthTest.java in the activemq-mqtt project., Attempt to reproduce but could not.  If you can provide a unit test that shows the issue please reopen.  Try using MQTTAuthTest as a starting point. ]
