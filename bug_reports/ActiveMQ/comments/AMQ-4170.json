[add exception log, Do you have a test case that reproduce this?
Have you tried with a newer broker version?  There's been a lot of work done since v5.5.1 to harden KahaDB., No test case.  Much work has been done in this area since 5.5.1 so I would suggest testing against 5.8.0 or a recent 5.9-SNAPSHOT]
