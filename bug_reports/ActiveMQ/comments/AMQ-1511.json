[Attached is a proposed svn diff patch for this issue. With this patch, a slave broker in a pure master/slave configuration will not open transports, connectors, bridges, proxies, etc. while it is attached to its master. Also, a broker will fail to  start if you configure it to have more than one masterConnector. The code was there to prevent this, but was broken.  , Patch applied in svn revision 646245]
