[We have created JMeter test case to reproduce the issue. You probably wish to tune it because we balanced number of producers and consumers in such way that we always have dozen of messages in a queue, but the queue is not growing.

We were running the test case for couple of days., Set "Priority' to 'Critical' because 'leveledb' is unusable if after failover new broker can not accept messages (because it is thinking it is 'out of space'), LevelDB has been deprecated and is no longer supported.]
