[James,
I committed a test that shows browsing the DLQ to work in the trunk (r1478266). I also tried from jconsole and it worked. Maybe try a snapshot?, I managed to confuse myself, I tried sending from hawtio to the ActiveMQ specifying timeToLive / JMSExpiration headers - which doesn't work. I raised AMQ-4506 to track this. 

Turns out you have to use the Camel endpoint for the queue today to send a message with a timeToLive / JMSExpiration header. Once you do that - in 5.9 snapshot - it does work and I can browse the DLQ. Many thanks! Its definitely a 5.8 bug]
