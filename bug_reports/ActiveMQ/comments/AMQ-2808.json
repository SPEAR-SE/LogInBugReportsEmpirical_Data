[I think I'm seeing this issue.

For me I have a test script I can run at the bash shell or via apache. If I repeatedly run and then ctrl+c the script from bash it reconnects no problem. If I run via Apache, then hit the browser stop button, then reload I instantly get told that my client-id is already connected.

Netstat -nat hows the client connection remains ESTABLISHED.

I am using Ubuntu 10.04 32 bit with ActiveMQ 5.3.2.

Just to add that I am connecting using stomp over ssl., I can confirm this issue also with 5.4.2. on windows xp and server 2008

HOWTO REPRODUCE:
* start broker with stomp connector enabled
* use any stomp client to connect and subscribe to a topic
* kill client without a disconnect
* reconnect client
-> subscribe will fail

If one kills the TransportConnector associated with the client via JMX, the connect is possible.

I think the bug might be somehow related to AMQ-2511
EDIT: It might also be related to AMQ-1376

The stack trace of the failed reconnect is appended, although it is not the cause of the bug.

, This is in some ways related to AMQ-3393.  There is also the fact that Stomp 1.0 doesn't allow for a keep alive so sometimes connection drops aren't detected.

Reopen if the problem persists.]
