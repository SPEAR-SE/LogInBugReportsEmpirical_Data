[The lack of filtering must be the result of a change to the resources plugin or the apache parent pom. In any event, just filtering the current version does not give us what we want for backward compatibility. We want all previous versions referenced so that existing schema references will still work. 

This is tricky to automate as it requires a commit and part of the pre release process. For the moment it may just be best to add the current and a set of future versions and note that it needs to be checked before doing a release., updated the file and added a few past and future versions. Added note to the release guide to ensure it is not missed in the future: http://activemq.apache.org/release-guide.html]
