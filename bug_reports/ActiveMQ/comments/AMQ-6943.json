[This is correct behavior and not an issue (the documentation probably just needs updating).  The remove info will contain the producer Id so you can use that to figure out when a producer was removed. 

If you want to know when a destination has no more producers you could figure this out by listening for the producer creation advisories and then tracking all the producers on a destination somehow (map or some other data structure, etc). Then when the RemoveInfo is received you can get the producer Id and remove that producer from your tracking.]
