[This can be worked around by using the virtual topic subscription strategy that is introduced by AMQ-5290., virtual topic workaround requires consumers to use queues and MQTT clients do not have the concept of queues. Only topics are supported in MQTT., The workaround transparently subscribes the connect client to a Queue linked to the virtual topic in question, there's nothing the client needs to do, on its end everything still appears to be Topic based. ]
