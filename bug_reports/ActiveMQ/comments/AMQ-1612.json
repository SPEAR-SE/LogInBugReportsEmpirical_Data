[Working as designed.  Non Temporary destinations are auto created on demand., I think I wasn't clear. Destinations are created when a publisher or subscriber is created.
1. Create a publisher, which auto creates the destination.
2. Delete the created destination.
3. Send a message on the publisher.

The message sent in #3 will never be delivered, the destination will NOT be recreated and there is no indication of a problem.
If #3 failed, it would give an opportunity to re-create the publisher and re-create the destination. , Can you provide a unit test that reproduces the problem., This issue occurs with both topics and queues.
What I am testing:
1. Create a topic or queue
2. Send a message
3. Via JMX, delete the destination
4. Send another message using the same MessageProducer as #2

What happens:
The second message is never delivered, and there is no indication of an error

I expect one of the following:
1. Both messages are delivered
2. The second MessageProducer.send throws an exception
3. ExceptionListener.onException for one or both of the connections is called, Modified the supplied test to work as a JUnit test, ran against the trunk build of AMQ broker, tests pass]
