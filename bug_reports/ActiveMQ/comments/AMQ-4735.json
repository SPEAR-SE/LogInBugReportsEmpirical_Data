[Are you running AMQ in a web app or something? Smells like the jetty container has slf4j on its classpath and it conflicts with slf4j version of AMQ.

AMQ has recently upgraded to slf4j 1.7.x, We run ActiveMQ as a standalone application, started by the Java Service Wrapper.

BTW, in this snapshot, 1.6 seems to be used:

activemq-5.9-20130919.101342-100/webapps/hawtio/WEB-INF/lib/slf4j-api-1.6.6.jar
activemq-5.9-20130919.101342-100/lib/jcl-over-slf4j-1.6.6.jar
activemq-5.9-20130919.101342-100/lib/optional/slf4j-log4j12-1.6.6.jar
activemq-5.9-20130919.101342-100/lib/slf4j-api-1.6.6.jar
, Try with a newer SNAPSHOT or build yourself. My local build of today has 1.7.5 of slf4j in the lib directory of the assembly., There is no newer snapshot in https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.9-SNAPSHOT/.

I will try the next one...]
