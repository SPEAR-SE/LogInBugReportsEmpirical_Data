[Can occur in some shutdown failure cases, for help on recovery see: http://fusesource.com/docs/broker/5.4/persistence/KahaDB-Recovery.html

Later versions have had much KahaDB hardening, would recommend you try a newer release. , Without more info on how this occurred there's not much that can be done here., Hey Tim - can you provide a link to a public version of that KahaDB-Recovery.html Fuse documentation?  I get a generic RedHat product documentation page with that link.]
