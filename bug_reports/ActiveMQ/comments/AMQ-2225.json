[You can either ensure that connections are not shared by using a different userName when creating the connection - or set the same exception listener to all connections, So as I understand client code using PooledConnectionFactory (PCF) by means of ConnectionFactory interface must be aware that PCF is involved. Nice., The code is working as it should, the PooledConnectionFactory returns the same PooledConnection for the same username / password combo so settings exception listeners on one of the two PooledConnection's created with the same username and password would have to overwrite the other since they are in fact the same object., Issue here is that regular CF and PCF can not be used interchangeably when ExceptionListeners are involved.]
