[I have written a JDBC adapter for ActiveMQ 3.2.2 that replaces this statement with a two-step temp table process in order to work with MySQL 4.0. Not sure if they have changed the JDBC adapter framework for ActiveMQ 4.0 or not, but I'm happy to share a howto if you want it., I played around with SQL today and figured out that changing the statement to :
DELETE ACTIVEMQ_MSGS FROM ACTIVEMQ_MSGS WHERE ( EXPIRATION<>0 AND EXPIRATION<1144326387433) OR ID <= ( SELECT min(ACTIVEMQ_ACKS.LAST_ACKED_ID) FROM ACTIVEMQ_ACKS WHERE ACTIVEMQ_ACKS.CONTAINER=ACTIVEMQ_MSGS.CONTAINER) 
doesn't kill mysql.  

Note "DELETE FROM ACTIVEMQ_MSGS ..." -> "DELETE ACTIVEMQ_MSGS FROM ACTIVEMQ_MSGS ...".  I'm thinking that treating it as a multicolumn delete doesn't confuse mysql to death.

The included patch changes the delete statement., setting a fix rev., The 4.x broker line is EOL]
