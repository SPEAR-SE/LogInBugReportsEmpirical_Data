[Do you have a unit test that can reproduce this.  It's unusual that the content of the message on the broker has been unmarshaled., Commit 1030fb184216d00e3fd43a416931acd3b2fc6794 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]

Add check for unmarshalled text body and handle that case.
(cherry picked from commit 1030fb184216d00e3fd43a416931acd3b2fc6794)
, I tested this with a trivial program using the "qpid_messaging" api (from qpid-cpp).
I just wrote a simple "hello" message without any special attributes set and then read it back again.

I will try to create a unit test in the "AmqpTransformerTest.java" file and post it here when I am done.
, I've added a small fix to check the text if the content is bare so it should now handle this case.  , That was quick.
Thanks for your help., Still worth testing if you manage to create a Java reproducer to check that all cases are handled., Do you know when the next release is planned?
