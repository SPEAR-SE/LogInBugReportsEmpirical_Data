[Can you clarify what version of ActiveMQ you are testing?  You've set the affected version as 6.0.0 which would be considered code from: https://github.com/apache/activemq-6 and not the 5.x tree which would be: https://github.com/apache/activemq, From the ports and queue names, the report doesn't seem to be for 5.x (though it may also suffer from the issue).  Issues for ActiveMQ6 are currently being tracked at https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ACTIVEMQ6.

The 6.0.0 version in this JIRA project looks to have been used for Apollo in the past. Should it be renamed to avoid such confusion?, Linking AMQ-5413 which seems to be about the same underlying issue, though for ActiveMQ 5 this time., I'm testing against https://github.com/apache/activemq-6. I think I saw the same thing on 5.x but I'd have to run the test again to be sure., Created an active 6 bug: ACTIVEMQ6-46, Closing this as it is directed at the ACTIVEMQ6 project which has an open issue covering this and a 5.x bug is already open AMQ-5413]
