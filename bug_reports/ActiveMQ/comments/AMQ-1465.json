[I've noticed this as well during my testing.  I modeled this behavior when i submitted patches to improve the LdapNetworkConnector support.  If no one takes this task on I will try to provide a patch for this at some point soon..., There are some trivial improvements that I'd like to add to this area and it looks like I'll have some free time to start on this today. I'll also take a crack at this issue. , I've attached an updated version of the patch. I've made 2 notable changes to the one submitted by Joe:
- changed base getName method to set and return "localhost" as the default if it has not been previously set
- LdapNetworkConnector getName method to return a better default representation, wrt the original implementation; if the user had multiple network connectors w/out a  'name' attribute, the broker would throw an exception. This was because you'd end up having multiple network connectors with the same name (i.e., "localhost"). My patch addressed this by assigning a unique name to each network connection having a 'null' name (i.e., no name specified). - Joe  , This is still the case for specific NetworkConnector impl (i.e. Discovery, Multicast, LDAP). However if there is a new connector in the future that does not override the default getName impl then it will default to "localhost.", Patch applied in SVN revision 646803]
