[Would be helpful if you could create a JUnit test to demonstrate your usage and show the problem., Via further tests I realized that TCP connections are showing up in the list however VM connections are not. This seems to be an oversight on my part as this may be by design. If so please feel free to close this bug., vm transports don't appear in the connection lists]
