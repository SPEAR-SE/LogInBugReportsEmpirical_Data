[[~davsclaus], Can you take a look at this? Long term someone needs to fix up the Karaf support and get rid of Spring DM but I'm not sure if there is anything that can be done to make 2.17.0 compatible in the meantime or if we have to revert to an older version., Yeah it should likely just add camel-spring in the features when install activemq-camel , Its really not a Camel problem. Its ActiveMQ itself that needs to do better at OSGi and install and support what it uses.

There is a somewhat crappy activemq-osgi module that has some old spring-dm code directly using a spring osgi bundle class and whatnot.

, Agreed that the Spring DM stuff needs to go and the osgi support needs to be updated, hopefully for a 5.14 release., Commit 28e4090d9561a1cd2a630bc35257539c30a13cf1 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Temporarily ignoring karaf camel tests until karaf integration is fixed

The failed test is causing the smoke tests to fail (so PRs don't pass)
and also seems to be keeping a broker alive so that other tests are
breaking as well
, Ignored failing tests to hopefully fix the other issues we are having in CI with brokers not shutting down properly.  The camel tests can be re-enabled as part of this Jira and the work here to fix our Karaf setup., [~davsclaus], What is the time frame for a Camel 2.18.0 release? I would like to remove spring-dm but in camel version 2.17.x the camel-spring module still depends on spring dm.  Looks like that has been separated out in the latest 2.18.0 snapshot builds so using version 2.18.0 would allow us to get rid of the spring dm dependency entirely., Around august or maybe into september when summer vacation is over, I reverted back to Camel 2.16.x for now in master.  We most likely just need to skip 2.17 and wait for 2.18 because of the incompatibilities with OSGI., We need camel 2.18 to remove Spring DM but Camel 2.18 requires Java 8.  So I think this should be targeted for a future version when we can raise the minimum version of ActiveMQ to Java 8 (maybe version 2.15.0), Camel tests were re-enabled as part of AMQ-6585]
