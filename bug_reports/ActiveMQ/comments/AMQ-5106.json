    AMQ-5106 fix: unable to build trunk from scratch due to missing dependency (eclipse:eclipse)

----
, Here is the pull req
https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/17, don't see any problem with an exclusion but I don't understand why it would be necessary.
that dependency is available from central at http://central.maven.org/maven2/xerces/xercesImpl/2.11.0/, the artifactId is quite different
org.apache.xerces:xercesImpl:jar
instead of
xerces:xercesImpl:jar, It's a bug in Karaf that the karaf pom depends on the wrong "org.apache.xerces" version.   Moving up to Karaf 2.3.4 should also fix that issue as 2.3.4 uses the "xerces" groupId., got it :-)
