[Any chance that this will get some attention? The current behavior pretty much requires that redelivery be implemented in client code by incrementing a message property and putting a cloned message back on the queue., We have now fixed this in rev 581747.  

The test case need to be sightly adjusted because every time rollback() occurs the redelivery counter is increased and when the consumer  holding the dispatched message is closed, the redelivery counter is also increased.  So by the time the fist consumer in the test case closes out it's session, the message will be marked redelivered as 4 times (test case assumes it will only be redelivered 3 times, 1 for each rollback).]
