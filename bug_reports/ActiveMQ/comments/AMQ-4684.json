[First thing I would do is try out the most recent 5.9-SNAPSHOT so you have all the LevelDB fixes that have gone in since the 5.8 release, which is many.  , Have you tried with the 5.9 release?, Could you give use the full list of .nfsxxxx files that were created?, Hi,

I have also seen similar issue in my case using ActiveMQ-5.10. When I go to my leveldb directory, I can see those .nfs**** files. I goggled a little bit and find that : If you remove a file that a currently running process still has open, the file isn't really removed. Once the process closes the file, the OS then removes the file handle and frees up the disk blocks.
Below is the snapshot of those files:

I think ActiveMQ is directly removing these files rather than closing and removing them,. Please take a look at this. 


Thanks,

, Lets track under AMQ-5404 since that more accurate about the root cause of this issue., is a dup of issue AMQ-5404, which has now been fixed.]
