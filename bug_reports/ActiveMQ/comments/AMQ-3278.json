[Can you attach a JUnit test case that reproduces this issue?, After restarting ActiveMQ, the messages that I couldn't see get delivered which probably is why none show in the Queues list after the restart.
If I use Time To Wait and Number of Repeats instead of CRON, it works fine.

I don't know how to set up a unit test to test this given the need for a listener and such a long delay.  I used the administration console to create the messages.  A very simple listener will do., Fixed in trunk.]
