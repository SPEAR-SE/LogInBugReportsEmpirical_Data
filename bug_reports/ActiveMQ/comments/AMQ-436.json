[The same thing happens with the C# STOMP client.  Messages posted in STOMP can be consumed by STOMP, but not JMS.  Likewise, messages posted in JMS can be consumed by JMS, but not stomp.  I have 2 connectors declared on one broker in Windows XP. , Not sure if this fixes the STOMP C client as well, but I did manage to get this working.  The trick is to set up your JMS queues as "myCompany/myQueue" rather then "/myCompany/myQueue".  Then, you can send STOMP messages to activeMQ using "/queue/myCompany/myQueue" as the destination.  (the initial "/queue/" gets eaten by STOMP)  Same should work in reverse., Looks like the issue was resolved.]
