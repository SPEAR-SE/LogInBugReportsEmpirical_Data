[This is in fact working as it should be.  Each connection creates a consumer for those temporary destination advisories so that it knows the state of temporary destinations and can throw exceptions as per the JMS spec in certain circumstances.  You can disable that feature on the connection via the watchTopicAdvisories option in ActiveMQConnectionFactory.  , Why does then the inFlightCount keep on rising if this is how it is supposed to be? I have well above 350.000 inFlightCount on my production instance. (What impact do the inFlightCount have? It does really not sound right to have anything else than 0 there for any period of time)

For future reference:
{code}
brokerService.setAdvisorySupport(false);
{code}
.. also disables these topics, "globally" from the Broker's side (as opposed to the client/ConnectionFactory's side), The advisory consumers on each ActiveMQConnection ACK using a lazy strategy meaning that if you have a large number of connections open then the inflight count can indeed grow large however since these are Topics there is not real impact on Broker side performance and the client will ack them as it needs in order to keep notifications flowing.  ]
