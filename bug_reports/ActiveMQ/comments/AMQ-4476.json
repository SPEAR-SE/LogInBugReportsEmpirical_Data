[Are you using the ActiveMQ RAR in WebSphere?

If so this RAR has been improved/fixed in AMQ 5.9 release. Can you give that a try?, No, in fact I'm using AMQ as custom JMS provider.
I believe it could have something to do with DLQ concept.
Doesn't it work this way that rejected messages are moved to DLQ's? 
Could that behavior be modified so rejected message is rolled back to the original queue (instead of DLQ) and therefore stops processing of other awaiting messages?]
