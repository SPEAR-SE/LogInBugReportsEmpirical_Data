[This is an XBean issue if it has OSGi manifest which is limited to blueprint < 1.0. You should report this at the Apache XBean JIRA tracker., There is a new XBean 3.12 being released in the near future. It supports Aries 1.0., When xbean 3.12 is out we should upgrade., I can install 5.8-SNAPSHOT in the just released Karaf 2.3.0.

There is an new XBean 3.12 out.]
