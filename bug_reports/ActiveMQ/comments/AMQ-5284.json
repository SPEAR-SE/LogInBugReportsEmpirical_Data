[I think this is a duplicate of https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5105
can you confirm that the workaround sort this for you?, Thanks for the suggestions Gary. I looked into AMQ-5105 when I had issues using LevelDB with 5.10.0. So that workaround will get 5.10.0 working with LevelDB. However, if you have an existing datastore from a previous version (in my case, 5.9.1)... You will still get the InvalidClassException.

I believe the underlying issue here is the serialization of the objects stored within the LevelDB index., It looks like the scala version was updated from 2.9.1 to 2.11.0 on 05/07/2014. 

With scala version 2.10+, it looks like the scala is targeting Java 1.6 by default. While earlier versions were targeting Java 1.5 by default.

This causes the serialized objects stored in the datastore to be incompatible with ActiveMQ 5.10+., [~vhle01] not sure if there's a good way to make this backward compatible at this point... might have to just drain existing queues in one version of the broker, and migrate to the newer versions. Does something like that work for you?, The workaround when moving between broker versions is to drain from the previous store to a newer broker instance that uses the new store format.  ]
