[The lockKeepAlivePeriod is now initialized to 30 seconds and accessors have been added so this can now be configured., The DB lock is getting refreshed correctly now.

One symptom of this bug was that when using a mySQL backed store, the lock would expire (due to inactivity) after about 12 hours. If the broker was setup as a master-slave, the slave would try and become the master but this would fail as the master was still listening ...
