[Fixed in svn revision 795069, Attaching unit test that shows messages stop forwarding depending on the order consumer paths are added and removed. See [this thread|http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Topic-consumers-are-lost-in-a-cyclic-network-td4659548.html]., There seems to be an ordering issue with this fix, as per the new unit test. Lets investigate for 5.8, fix in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/6c5732bc

thanks for the easymock test case. it helped focus in on the real problem.

btw: added the bridge identity to the consumerId generator seed, so that the origin of network consumers is more visible. {code}Broker2->Broker1-52624-1378503483334-23_1_1_1, Broker2->Broker0-52624-1378503483334-31_1_1_1{code}
