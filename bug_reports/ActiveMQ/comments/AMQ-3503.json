, You can get the latest snapshot version from [here|https://repository.apache.org/content/groups/snapshots-group/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.6-SNAPSHOT/]., The db log files seem to be getting deleted now...whereas before (in 5.5.0) all the db-*-.log files were still in the directory (over 1000 of them).

So...for right now the latest snapshot seems to have fixed this.

I'll follow up later after a few billion messages have been put in the queue and it's still running.

That will be in a day or two.

Total files open by apachemq seems stable at around 212-215

lsof | grep apache | wc -l

, OK...I think we can close this now as of the latest snapshot
I've pumped in about 5 billion message.
I've got 207 files open now so it's not increasing at all., PList updates have resolved this issue.]
