[All of our XHTML works perfectly in IE 6.  What's the issue?, When activemq-web-console is deployed on IE 6, it just shows a blank page.

<script type="" src=""/> doesnt work on IE 6

it should be:
<script type="" src=""></script>

I've attached a patch. :), changed <script/> to <script></script> for main.jsp in decorators, IE 6 was doing the right thing.
