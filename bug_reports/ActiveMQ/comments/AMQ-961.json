[Might relate to the problem I encountered in http://www.nabble.com/Failover-and-DemandForwardingBridge-tf2383410.html#a6642973.
Apparently, the DemandForwardingBridge does not resume correctly after a network interruption.
For me, the attached patch worked, but I'm not aware of any side effects, so please check., Thanks.  I will apply this patch and try it out.
, This does appear to fix the problem.  I'd had a similar problem with AMQ 4.0.1, reported in AMQ-776, which I had fixed.  But, for the second part of that problem, the original patch did not work.  This issue and the second part of AMQ-776, are fixed now by your patch.  I'll update AMQ-776, too.
, Applied patch in SVN revision 491185
