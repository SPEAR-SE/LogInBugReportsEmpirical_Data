[I suspect that the issue of only one consumer seeing messages is due to some message batching by the broker for each session (load balancing?). If this is the case, what is the parameter ?

Concerning the message evaporating after a number of rollbacks, this may also be configurable, but where is the message evaporating to ? Is there a default deadletter repository somewhere ?]
