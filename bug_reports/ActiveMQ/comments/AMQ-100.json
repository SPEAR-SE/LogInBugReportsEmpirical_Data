[fancy taking a look at this one?, This works for transient queues. With persistent queues, there is an issue where messages are consumed correctly, but don't appear to be deleted from the store correctly (they get resent on restarting the broker., Just grabbbed the latest sourced from the head it seems to work for me now as well. 

The test that I was using always failed when sending the third message in a round robin distribution of queue messages to a cluster of two servers using the CVS head on the filed date.

When I added the following code to randomly select a subscriber in the QueueMessageContainerManager.doPoll method the messages were dropped in random... 

         int count = 0;
         ActiveMQMessage msg = null;
         if (subList != null && subList.size() > 0) {
+        	for(int i = (int) (Math.random() * 100); i >= 0; i--) {
+        		subList.rotate();
+        	}
             do {
                 boolean dispatched = false;
                 msg = container.poll();

this alteration works for me now as well...

I guess this issue actually boiled down to some other problem that has been fixed., The problem occured more frequently(before the latest update) with less debug messages. When using DEBUG instead of INFO logging it was quite hard to reproduce the issue. When they occurred in debug mode the messages were dropped with the message "Broker already visited...". Perhaps this was/is? some kind of race condition?]
