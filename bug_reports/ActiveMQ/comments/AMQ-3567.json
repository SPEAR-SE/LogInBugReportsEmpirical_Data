[Here is the patch for this issue.

The patch also includes a test that will reproduce the exception but the thing to note is that to be able to confirm that the patch worked.  I needed to use the underlying log4j logging implementation.  The test will depend on that to be able to confirm that it works.  If in the future activemq intends to use a different slf4j bridge then this test case will need to be updated.
, Applied the patch, made some mods to the test to remove the hardcoding of port 61616.
