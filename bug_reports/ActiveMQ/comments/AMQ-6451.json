AMQ-6451 - catch errors on preallocation. allocate direct buffer on start and reuse to ensure resource availability at runtime
, moved that buffer allocation to the start method so that resource constraints are triggered at broker start. A single instance is now reused.
The code path that leads to the leak is now guarded with a try catch such that any error during preallocation is just logged. 
Fatal errors will bubble up again on journal write if they are important.]
