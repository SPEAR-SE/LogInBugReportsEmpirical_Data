[This has been resolved with the upgrade to *5.4.0* and can be closed., Fixed with *5.4.0* upgrade., Looks a lot like the stacktrace I've just seen on 5.5.0, Trying to either purge or delete virtual topic consumer queues when topic still exists.

May need to be re-openned.
, Sorry, I'm putting it down to AMQ-3425 instead.

, I have the same problem on 5.9.1 :), Still see a warning of this error on 5.9.1, Same problem with 5.10.0 here, I confirm this problem still exist on 5.9.1. Steps to reproduce:
# Unzip the package, run {{bin\activemq}}
# Open the admin console at {{localhost:8161/admin}} with user/pass admin/admin
# Browse any queue/topic and delete/purge it, Hi everyone, I also met this problem days ago, on my Firefox. I googled it and found that if I change the browser to IE, the problem would go away. So I guess that there might be some configuration in Firefox (maybe the Cookie configuration?) forbid the queue creation function, and a check on the browser setting might work. Hope that would help you., Hello together.
Yohn, thank you very much! Using IE helped.]
