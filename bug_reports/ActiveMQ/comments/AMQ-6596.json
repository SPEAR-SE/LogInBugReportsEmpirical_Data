[Please find attached the packet that was responsible for this behavior (packet.raw), We noticed the same behavior by sending arbitrary data to the openwire port in our ActiveMQ 5.10.2.

Not sure if this is related to the same bug, but executing the following bash script on the same machine:

{code}
#!/bin/bash

if [ -t 0 ]; then stty -echo -icanon -icrnl time 0 min 0; fi

count=0
keypress=''
while [ "x$keypress" = "x" ]; do
  let count+=1
  echo -ne $count'\r'
  keypress="`cat -v`"
  dd if=/dev/urandom bs=10000 count=120 > /dev/tcp/localhost/61616
done

if [ -t 0 ]; then stty sane; fi

echo "You pressed '$keypress' after $count loop iterations"
exit 0
{code}

makes the OutOfMemoryError happens few times even the data are smaller (try with bs=100 instead).

By executing this script on the latest ActiveMQ 5.14.5 I get the same results.

Here's a extract of the logs:

When our vulnerabiliy scanner (I don't know which one it was) created such requests, our ActiveMQ has blocked unexpectedly., ... and if I "dd" your packet.raw with:

{{dd if=packet.raw > /dev/tcp/localhost/61616 }}

I get the OOME everytime (Tested with AMQ 5.10.2).

I think this is more an issue in OpenWire protocol than specific to ActiveMQ.
, Try disabling the OpenWire caching and see if that helps.  You can set cacheEnabled to false to disable it as an option on the connection string.

See http://activemq.apache.org/configuring-wire-formats.html, I have tried to disable the OpenWire caching but it seems that the result is the same. You can find below the updated definition of the transportConnector:

{code}
    <transportConnectors> 
      <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?cacheEnabled=false"/> 
    </transportConnectors> 
{code}

{code}, I think you have to use wireFormat.cacheEnabled

So it would be:

{noformat}
 <transportConnectors> 
      <transportConnector name="openwire" uri="tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?wireFormat.cacheEnabled=false"/> 
    </transportConnectors> 
{noformat}

This may not fix your issue but it is worth a shot as sometimes when I have seen issues with Openwire marshalling it has been related to the cache and disabling fixed it.
, Yes you are right, I forgot to use the  "wireFormat"  prefix . Unfortunately I still receive the same error.]
