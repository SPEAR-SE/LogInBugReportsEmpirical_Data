[I had the same problem; my workaround is to remove the line
SUNJMX="-Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote"

from the activemq script, Willing to close this as the workaround works.  The shutdown (and others) script works as well, but if you change the JMX port in the activemq xml configuration file, you need to use the --jmxurl service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:NEWPORT/jmxrmi arguments to all scripts.  Would be nice if the scripts could figure this out from the xml configuration.]
