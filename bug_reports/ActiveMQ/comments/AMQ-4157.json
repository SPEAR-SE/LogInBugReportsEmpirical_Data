[Note in my integration test which does reproduce this, it failed 5 times out of 231 runs., I confirmed the workaround.  When turning off caching, the test no longer failed (500 iterations succeed), getting this on the radar for 5.8, There is another workaround, {code}<kahaDB concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues="false" ..>{code}, fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1431463&view=rev

@Martin, thanks for the great description and diagnosis, it very much helped the process of building a reproducible junit test case to validate and protect the fix., This test is still failing for me, usually with a message like the one below. This test failed on message 992, but typically it fails on 998 or 999.

I will attach the log.
