[and the jmsContainer object is injected a "transactionManager" property by spring's autowire=byName., Hello Alan,
I am trying to narrow down the issue, please bear with me :) First, are you actually getting a NullPointerException thrown from the Queue after a message is received by the container or after several?
Can you add your full stack trace to this ticket with debug on spring jms, activemq and javax.jms?

1. One thing I notice in your above configuration is that you specify
<property name="concurrentConsumers" value="1"/>
<property name="maxConcurrentConsumers" value="1"/>

in your DefaultMessageListenerContainer. So you are not using dynamic scaling yet demarcating both concurrent and maxConcurrent as the same value. Since the default value for concurrentConsumers is 1 and you are not doing dynamic scaling, I think you can at least remove the maxConcurrentConsumers property, if not both.

Thanks. I have more thoughts on an alternate configuration above but wanted to see your trace first.

Cheers,
