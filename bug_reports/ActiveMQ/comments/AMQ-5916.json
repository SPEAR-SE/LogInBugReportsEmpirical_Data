[The org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.BrokerView class has a createDurableSubscriber(String clientId, String subscriberName, String topicName, String selector) function and it instantiates a new connection context like this - 

ConnectionContext connectionContext = new ConnectionContext();

this fails to copy the securityContext from the shared global connectionContext.

The above line must be replaced with 
ConnectionContext sharedContext = BrokerSupport.getConnectionContext(broker.getContextBroker());
ConnectionContext context = sharedContext.copy();, Attached a patch for this issue - AMQ-5916-GMURTHY-PATCH.TXT, With the patch applied the test BrokerViewSlowStoreStartupTest#testBrokerViewOnSlowStoreStart fails when it calls createDurableSubscriber due to an exception not being thrown.  Should investigate if the test is wrong or the fix has broker something. , Please take a look at my attached new patch AMQ-5916-GMURTHY-PATCH2.TXT
BrokerViewSlowStoreStartupTest#testBrokerViewOnSlowStoreStart should not fail after applying AMQ-5916-GMURTHY-PATCH2.TXT
I added a null check in the code.
Thanks.
