[I don't think that's your full stack trace, however I think you're getting a class not found.

Are you not including all dependencies on your classpath?, Hi John,

correct stacktrace is filtered (we use proguard and as such little added value)

Thanks for the pointer with the classpath. Indeed hawtbuf.jar is missing and adding it fixed it. 

Now I just need to find out why ivy did not add it (while the others like geronimo-j2ee-management_1.1_spec-1.0.1.jar) are present.


Thanks

Marcel

, classpath issue, jar was missing, Not sure either, not much of an ivy user so can't really comment.

the scopes look correct in the pom and i don't think have changed since 5.11
