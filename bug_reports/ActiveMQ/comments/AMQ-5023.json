[This is not a bug report.  Questions should be directed to the mailing list., Timothy Bish,

by looking at this error, I have one question, If our active mq server is in one version and client is with different version. Can we test http connection between these two ?

Lets suppose my active mq broker is with 5.12.3 version, where as my active mq client is in 5.8.0 version. Can I test ? 
because my client is failed with above error message.

Please help me answer to the above question.]
