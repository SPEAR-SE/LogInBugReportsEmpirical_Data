[final fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=rev&rev=1304020

issue was the change of the headPageId for a list, this identity page was not persisted on a change so it could lead to corruption on a restart. The fix is to retain the headPageId for the lifetime of the list.
Issue effects durable subs and possibly non persistent messages in the filepending message cursor as it also uses the listindex.]
