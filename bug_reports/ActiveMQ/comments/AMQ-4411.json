[fix in http://svn.apache.org/r1461608, Just for a heads up, I think this still occurs in karaf 3.0.0.

I tried installing the 5.9-SNAPSHOT in karaf 3 and get the "No matching native libraries found." error. I checked out activemq to double check and the wildcard * is present in the nativecode section.

It's probably worth noting that the karaf 3 instance is created by the karaf tooling plugin so perhaps something something is missing there., Can anyone suggest a solution so that I can get around this temporarily without building activemq? running in Karaf 2.3.1]
