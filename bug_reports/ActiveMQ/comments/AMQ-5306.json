    Fix for AMQ-5306

    Cleaned up logic around the use of comma separated destinations, sysTest.totalDests and producer.destComposite. The logic is as follows:
    
    Given -Dproducer.destName=foo:
    default (-DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 1 destination - foo
    
    -DsysTest.totalDests=2
    * publishes to 2 destinations - foo.0, foo.1
    
    Given -Dproducer.destName=foo,cheese:
    default (-Dproducer.destComposite=false -DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 2 destinations - foo and cheese
    
    (-Dproducer.destComposite=false) -DsysTest.totalDests=2
    * publishes to 4 destinations - foo.0, foo.1 and cheese.0, cheese.1
    
    -Dproducer.destComposite=true (-DsysTest.totalDests=1)
    * publishes to 1 composite destination - "foo,cheese"
    
    -Dproducer.destComposite=true -DsysTest.totalDests=2
    * publishes to 1 composite destination - "foo.0,foo.1,cheese.0,cheese.1"

    Modified so that single-destination tests do not append a numerical prefix.

    Unified the logic for appending numerical prefixes between normal one-off destinations and composite destinations. Fixed composite destination construction logic that created 2 destinations when sysTest.totalDests was 1 or 2.
