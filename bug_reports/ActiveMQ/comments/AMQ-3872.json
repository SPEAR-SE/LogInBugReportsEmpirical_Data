[link to corresponding kahaDB issue, kahaDB needs some work for the durable sub case., fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?rev=1345202&view=rev

JDBC 2PC is now two JDBC ops, an insert/update in prepare and an update for the outcome.
An additional xid column is needed in both the acks and messages table. A non null value for the xid means that the update is pending the outcome of the xa transaction matching that xid.
Recovery scans for non null xid and recreates the appropriate state pending the outcome.
Pending transactions are visible via jmx so that they can be forced.]
