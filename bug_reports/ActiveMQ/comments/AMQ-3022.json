[To suspend/resume a transaction, the JMS session would need to track each transaction for each consumer (as well as any messages that were consumed in every transaction). This is to ensure that acks do not occur where they should not and do not occur out of order as this would really, really munge the state of the broker. FWIW, there are many more details to this situation that I'm glossing over. To support such functionality would require a very significant amount of work/surgery on the broker! 

The bottom line is that the suspend/resume of transactions is not supported in ActiveMQ. What I am going to do is patch the code to catch any attempt to suspend or join a given transaction and throw a more informative error., This issue is duplicated by AMQ-3059]
