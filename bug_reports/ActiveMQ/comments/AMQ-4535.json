[Hi, do you have some way for us to reproduce the usage scenario you were executing?, To run the reproducer:
 0. Start broker with default settings except that leveldb should be configured instead of kahadb
 1. edit the script and change the IP to the one where broker is running. (You may also want to comment out some interrations in the script.)
 2. create in the same directory a directory called perfharness containing IBM Perf Harness files
 3. start a scripts as ./amq_test_reproducer.sh AMQ_DIR

AMQ_DIR should contain activemq-all-5.8.0.jar, Fixed in trunk.  Thanks for the bug report!, Hi,

here are the logs from the long test

in the end the whole test hangs
