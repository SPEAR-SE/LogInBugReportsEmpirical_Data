[Here's a trace that has three transfers.
1. No header at all.
2. Empty header
3. Header with Durable=false
In the ActiveMQ web browser the first two messages are durable and the third is not.
, Looks like the JMS Transformer code defaults to the JMS default value for Messages if that header is not present.  I'll update ours to use the AMQP expected non-durable default.  , Fixed on master]
