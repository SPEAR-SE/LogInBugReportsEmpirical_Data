[
Not sure if AMQ4643Test.java will reproduce the issue consistently (gtully mentioned a potential race condition) but it seems to consistently fail in my env, fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=r1508602

thanks for the test.
The ft/JDBCRestart* tests had workarounds for the non deterministic behaviour that are now removed., the fix was to introduce a SuppressReplyException that an IOExceptionHandler can use it to mask the current exception, it will be trapped by the transport so that a reply will not be propagated, the client will see a socket.close in place.

To get immediate notification of store failure on a client, the DefaultIOExceptionHandler needs to be configured to ingnoreAllErrors{code}
<broker ...>
 <ioExceptionHandler>
   <defaultIOExceptionHandler ignoreAllErrors="true" />
 </ioExceptionHandler>
 ...{code}]
