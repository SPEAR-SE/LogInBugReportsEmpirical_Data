[Unit test that demonstrates bug by failing an assertion resulting from the duplicate/unexpected subscription propagation., Patch that, once applied, allows AMQ4148Test to pass., Does indeed appear to be an issue.  I tweaked the test a bit to ensure it doesn't fail because it didn't sleep long enough, and also ensure it doesn't hang on shutdown.  , Nice investigation, applied the patch and an updated version of the test. ]
