    AMQ-6908 Use WebClient in QueueBrowseQuery

    `org.apache.activemq.web.controller.SendMessage` uses `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient`, which can be configured to use console login credential instead of system user credential (by setting the connection factory username and password to `null`). This allows seamless per-user based authorization for operations through the web console. 
    
    `org.apache.activemq.web.QueueBrowseQuery` was not using the `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient` so it was impossible to setup authorization on per-user basis for browsing messages of a queue through web console. 
    
    This change migrates `org.apache.activemq.web.QueueBrowseQuery` to use `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient`.
