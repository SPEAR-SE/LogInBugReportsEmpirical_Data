[StringArrayEditor is referenced from a static collection outside of WebAppClassLoader., The undeployed web application remains in memory until you re-deploy or re-start. After re-start the reference is replaced by the new StringArrayEditor class loaded by the new WebAppClassLoader. 
The issue doesn't happen when ActiveMQ libraries are in Tomcat shared libs., Appears to be the same issue., Closed because this is a duplicate of another issue., I have fixed this, see comments on AMQ-3797.
, Sergey, thanks for reporting, and having a screenshot with the evidence.]
