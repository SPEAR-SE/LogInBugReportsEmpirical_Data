[I just
 
1) downloaded the 4.0 source from: http://activemq.com/site/activemq-40-release.html
2) removed my ~/.maven/repository 
3) ran maven -Dmaven.test.skip=true

and I got a build error with the following message:

Invalid Redirect URI from: http://cvs.apache.org:80/repository//incubator-activemq/jars/activeio-core-3.0-beta3.jar to: http://people.apache.org/repository//incubator-activemq/jars/activeio-core-3.0-beta3.jar

Seems apache is doing redirect that my maven is not liking.

I applied a patch that got me past that, but subsequently, Geronimo 1.2-SNAPSHOT has changed something since activemq was release which breaks the gbean module from compiling.  Luckly the gbean module is not need to get a standalone activemq to build so I disable the module from the build.


, I have updated the release notes to explain how to apply the patch that make the source distribution build again.  See:
