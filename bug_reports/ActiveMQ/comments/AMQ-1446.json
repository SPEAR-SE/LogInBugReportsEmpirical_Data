[Hi David,

A test case for this would be good -

Rob, This seems fixed - please re-open if not the case, I have updated to 603420 and I still see this issue I am afraid.
, This should be fixed by svn revision  619347, I see dozens of these messages whenever I shut down my app that uses ActiveMQ 5.9 with persistence off.]
