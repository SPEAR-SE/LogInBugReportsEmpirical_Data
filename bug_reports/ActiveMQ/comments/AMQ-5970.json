[Alright so this is related to a missing jar file in the lib folder for Java 7 users, but why hasn't this been intergrated into the latest release?
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-4520
http://activemq.apache.org/apollo/documentation/user-manual.html#Working_Around_Java_7_SSL_Bugs, Currently a simple check is done just to see if the bouncy castle jar is on the classpath and if it is then it is loaded.  If the jar were to get packaged we might have to be smarter about how it gets loaded.  For example, maybe add a configuration option to enable/disable loading the bouncy castle provider implementation.  The default should probably be true for JDK7 and false for JDK8 and above., I don't think it is a good idea to automatically choose a different SSL implementation for a user.  The expected behavior is to use the JDK  implementation and I think we should stick with the default and document the issue like Apollo does so that if a user runs into a problem they can switch out the implementation if they want. I have added documentation to this page: http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-ssl.html]
