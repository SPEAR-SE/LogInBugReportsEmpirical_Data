[Could you attach the sources to the test client?, From the logs it seems the client is using XA transactions., Small project attempting to reproduce the problem.  Not an all-in-one package; the broker must be configured and run separately., I attached a small test program that attempts to reproduce the problem.  With this program, I failed to reproduce the problem.

Can you give this a try and let me know what you find?  If it does not reproduce the problem for you, please provide more details of the environment and clients.  Such as the numbers of producers and consumers, destinations used, and flow of messages., Please provide some feedback.  Otherwise, I'll close this as "Cannot Reproduce"., Does LevelDB support XA Transactions? I've seen a few references that says it doesn't. i.e. https://access.redhat.com/site/documentation/en-US/JBoss_A-MQ/6.0/html/Configuring_Broker_Persistence/files/LevelDBConfiguration.html, Closing this since we failed to reproduce and the creator of the issue is not providing more details.  Please reopen if more details become available.]
