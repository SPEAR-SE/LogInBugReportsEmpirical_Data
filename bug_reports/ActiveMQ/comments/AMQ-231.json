[Fixed., I am facing same problem.
i have a single broker.
one consumer is subscribed for a topic.
consumer can receive messages on that topic.

then i manually put the broker down(simulated network failure)

after putting broker up again, i can reconnect to broker.(can see the topic available again).
i send messages on that topic
but consumer cant recieve messages on that topic.
