[Attached a unit test based on your sample code.  No exceptions or errors are seen when run against trunk., Could not reproduce this with supplied code, if you can make the attached JUnit test case reproduce this behavior please reopen and attach the new test., new junit test that correctly simulate problem, corrected test, @Martin, you need to tick the license grant option on that latest test attachment., The fix looks to be fairly trivial, if you can update your test attachment with the license grant we should be able to get this in a 5.6 release., I have to reupload junit test bacause of license., Fix applied in trunk, thanks for getting the test going., As part of the reqworked fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2191 - the need to wrap close operaitons with suspended interrupts goes away. There is a more general form of your test that verifies all is still good.
Essentially, the suspend/resume interrupt is moved into FutureResponse where the InterruptedException is handled as a failure 'only' during a request. Requests and oneways can be safely invoked while interrupted and the interrupted state is retained.

It would be great if you could cast your eyes over the reworked fix in AMQ-2191 , Looks good, ship it!]
