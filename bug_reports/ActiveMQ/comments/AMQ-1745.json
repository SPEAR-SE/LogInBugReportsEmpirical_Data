[looks like currently you have to build and install camel locally to get around this, On my system the Camel 1.4-SNAPSHOTs are correctly downloaded by maven. However, the test classes of the _activemq-core_ module do not compile because some of them contain an import for class _org.apache.camel.impl.CamelTemplate_ which in the current Camel 1.4-SNAPSHOT jars is actually located in the _org.apache.camel_ package.

I have attached a patch for these test classes as well ...
, Adapts the erroneous import statements in the _activemq-core_ test classes for class _org.apache.camel.CamelTemplate_, Robs solution requires no patch. Checkout camel trunk, mvn install it, and then mvn install activemq trunk., I think this could be caused by nightly snapshots being a bit borked. Am just in the process of setting them up on another box just to make sure..., trunk depends on released camel 1.4]
