[This is actually a bug in our documentation :)

The issue is that the ?property=value notation is applied to the last TransportChannel that its applied - so in your example thats the TcpTransportChannel, not the ReliableTransportChannel. To fix this, try using () around the list of URLs in the reliable transport. e.g.

 <networkChannel remoteBrokerName="roadrash-1>roadrash-2" maximumRetries="0" reconnectSleepTime="15000" uri="reliable:(tcp://localhost:62626)?keepAliveTimeout=60000&amp;establishConnectionTimeout=604800000"/>

Its a bug in commons-beanutils that it should barf to tell you that 'keepAliveTimeout' is not a valid property on TcpTransportChannel to make it a bit more obvious whats going on. (We'll have that fixed in AMQ 4.x)

See http://activemq.org/Configuring+Transports for more details, Okay, it did not seem to work as expected in the network channel so I tried to duplicate on a client connection. The URL I used was:

reliable:(tcp://localhost:63636)?keepAliveTimeout=60000&useAsyncSend=true&maximumRetries=0&failureSleepTime=30000&establishConnectionTimeout=604800000

The log entries that resulted follow.  From what I can see is that all of the properties that should be applied to the list have been rejected. 

Note: this test performed against revsion 482

, FWIW the following is the code I use for creating connection.

ActiveMQConnectionFactory connectionFactory = new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(ActiveMQConnection.DEFAULT_USER, ActiveMQConnection.DEFAULT_PASSWORD, conurl);
connectionFactory.setDoMessageFragmentation("false");
ActiveMQConnection con = (ActiveMQConnection) connectionFactory.createConnection();, Maybe I jumped the gun here.  While the Initial message in the log show failures to set properties later log activity show differently.  Is this due to the fact that there is no active channel when the Reliable transport object is created, then the properties are applied later to the underly transport channel?, Nothing to fix, log displays default info at construction before property is applied]
