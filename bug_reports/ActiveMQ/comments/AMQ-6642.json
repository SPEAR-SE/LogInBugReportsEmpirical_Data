AMQ-6642: Fix potential NPE on updateMessage

Fixing potential NPE when calling updateMessage on a Queue store in
KahaDB if subscription statistics are enabled.  Also reduced the
visibily from public to protected to subscription statistic related
methods that shouldn't be public and added null pointer checks there as
well.
