[We've done a bunch of changes in 4.1.1 in this area to fix a few different related issues. I wonder could you see if the current 4.1.1 build fixes your issue?

http://people.apache.org/repo/m2-snapshot-repository/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/4.1-SNAPSHOT/, Could you attach the configuration file that you were using?  Thanks!, Downgrading to minor since the reported bug is just affecting the flexibility of the configuration and does not actually break typical processing that broker does., Please re-open issue if you do get around to attaching the configuration file that you were using.]
