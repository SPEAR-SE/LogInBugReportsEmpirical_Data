[This could potential lead to data loss as writes to the journal are being done async.
, This bug is still marked open/unresolved despite being in the resolved bugs list for the 5.10 release vote.

Using heavy message loads and triggering failovers, I believe I can trigger this problem (I can lose a small number of messages, this seems a plausible reason) against out 5.9.1 dev cluster. I haven't been able to set up a cluster of 5.10-SNAPSHOT to test if it is actually fixed yet. Do you believe this bug has actually been resolved?, this looks done to me.]
