[This test shows how heap committed memory increments with time. Changing the dialogBatch parameter from true to false in the testRequestResponsePattern method disables the usage of temporary queues, making the committed heap memory constant during the test.
, Working as designed.  A temp destination exists for the life of the Connection.  The test case create a single connection for the requestor and the responder so each request / response cycle creates a new destination that will live on after the cycle.  You could just use one temp destination for this pattern.  You could also look into auto removing inactive destinations for this: http://activemq.apache.org/delete-inactive-destinations.html]
