[Feel free to request any additional information from me.
If desired, I also can provide the WebLogic MDB artifact and configuration instructions on how to set up the Foreign Destination.
I even could provide a complete zip of my WebLogic installation via a separate channel, because I can't and won't attach it here. :-)
, Bug is reproducable when the MDB:
- has the @TransactionAttribute annotation set to TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED.
- uses the mapped XAConnectionFactory as connectionFactoryJndiName @ActivationConfigProperty.

However, the bug does not occur when the MDB is non-XA:
- has the @TransactionAttribute annotation set to TransactionAttributeType.NOT_SUPPORTED.
- uses the mapped ConnectionFactory as connectionFactoryJndiName @ActivationConfigProperty.
, Further update. The issue does not occur, when reducing the threads of the MDB from 16 to 1.
I used the following weblogic-ejb-jar.xml for testing:
{code}
<weblogic-ejb-jar>
    <weblogic-enterprise-bean>
        <ejb-name>MyListenerEjbBean</ejb-name>
        <dispatch-policy>WorkManager-0</dispatch-policy>
    </weblogic-enterprise-bean>
    <work-manager>
        <name>WorkManager-0</name>
        <max-threads-constraint>
            <name>WorkManager-Constraint-0</name>
            <count>1</count>
        </max-threads-constraint>
        <ignore-stuck-threads>true</ignore-stuck-threads>
    </work-manager>
</weblogic-ejb-jar>
{code}

However, as soon as the thread count is bigger than 1, the bug is reproducable.
