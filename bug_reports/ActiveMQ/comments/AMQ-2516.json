[Find attached the ActiveMQ configuration, the log showing the security exception and a JMS sample to send a message with TTL into the queue., resolved in r884778
thanks for the good description. send to dlq (when configured) now uses the brokers security context so that it is immune to authentication configuration., @ Concombre:  Did you find a work-around for ActiveMQ 5.3.0?  I'm also using the FUSE broker and am seeing this issue., @Scott: No, no workaround sorry. This issue is not a blocking one for the project I am working on so we just deal with it ignoring the errors. But we plan to upgrade to a new FUSE Message Broker release with fix for this issue as soon as possible (when available).
, @Concombre:  Since this is a one line fix, the easiest solution we found was to download the fuse source and rebuild it with maven.  It takes a bit of time for maven to automatically download all the required libraries the first time it runs, but after its done you get a full build with the solution in place.]
