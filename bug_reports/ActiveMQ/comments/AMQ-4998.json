[This is the patch file, I also encountered the same problem.

when i used the feature :Networks of Brokers
http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html

static or multicast  all lead to this issue., You could try my patch file include migration of network ttl ->2 messageTTL consumerTTL,  thx ~
it works., Applied the patch with commit dcbac84a8c4d9dabeb793081557d3bb5c6694d51.

Also added the use of "<c:out>" to ensure proper html-encoding of the values.

Thank you!]
