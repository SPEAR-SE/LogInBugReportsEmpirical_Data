AMQ-6823 Ensure that MessagePull is works across HTTP transport

The MessagePull command needs to have the transients initialized such
that the pull operation works across transports that use XStream or
other marshaling that doesn't performs custom serialization. , Commit eccbd75bcffdb1ae0e160e06383f6a2dffca6e88 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~tabish121]

, Bugfix tested successfully., Do we believe that this was introduced in 5.14.5 as indicated by the Affects Version(s) field, or do we think this goes further back in the version history? Maintaining an accurate Affects Version value helps users know whether their version of the broker is believed to be prone to a bug or not, so if we believe this goes further back (as implied by AMQ-6877), it would be great if we could update the field.

I looked at the fix and wasn't clear on why that would relate to the behavior described, which made it impossible to figure out at which point the problem was introduced, otherwise I'd do this myself. So hopefully [~tabish121] can shed some light on when the problem was introduced.]
