[Attaching STACK_DIFFS.txt which contains a unified diff of the two stack traces.

Notice that the second stack trace only adds calls in the middle of the first - in other words, there's a redundant path to the lock call.  Most of the stack is in Spring Context and XBean startup code., Attaching activemq.log from a failed start, with the two stack traces included (see "TBD AAA").

Note the duplication of PListStore log line (and the Using Persistence Adapter line that follows).  The two PListStore lines show two different paths.  Is that normal?, hmm, maybe there is a problem with both the @PostConstruct and InitMethod decorators on org.apache.activemq.xbean.XBeanBrokerService

seems there are two attempts to start a broker instance, which is not good.

use start=false as a broker attribute in the xml to avoid. Is this on trunk?

, the default ./bin/activemq start script uses this mechanism, guess the xml config must be a little different if this is not showing up. It may be the start=false attribute is the difference. But it may also be that some spring or xbean dep change makes this visible., Thanks Gary.  Yes, this is with trunk. I have been seeing it for a little while, but always putting it off.  This time, I decided to get it captured.

I'm thinking there is a race condition.  I'll try start=false and see if that helps.

Any ideas on how I can see what Spring is up to without adding debugging to the Spring code?  I tried increasing logging for spring to debug, but that didn't help., with spring it is always the debugger - get eclipse or idea to download the sources from mvn, Looks like I may have picked up a change that is causing this:

*WEB-INF/webconsole-embedded.xml*
{noformat}
  <bean id="brokerService" class="org.apache.activemq.xbean.BrokerFactoryBean">
  <bean id="brokerURL" factory-bean="brokerService" factory-method="getVmConnectorURI"/>
{noformat}

Dropping priority for now as this is likely local to my repo., I also encounter this problem in 5.9.0, Found the problem.  There are 2 {{webconsole-embedded.xml}} files in the source!

{noformat}
./activemq-web-console/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/webconsole-embedded.xml
./assembly/src/release/webapps/admin/WEB-INF/webconsole-embedded.xml
{noformat}

Any idea why?  Let's wipe one.  The one in release is the usual one; the other is wrong.  Doing development on the webapp, I was copying the activemq-web-console folder and getting the bad version.

@Isaac - could you have seen the problem for the same reason?, I checked 5.9.0 source code and find the same two files.

activemq-parent-5.9.0-source-release\activemq-parent-5.9.0\activemq-web-console\src\main\webapp\WEB-INF\webconsole-embedded.xml
activemq-parent-5.9.0-source-release\activemq-parent-5.9.0\assembly\src\release\webapps\admin\WEB-INF\webconsole-embedded.xml

I'm not sure it's the root cause of my problem.
I setup network of brokers and test restart it one by one about one month ago, only encounter few times.
Maybe I can review my test and check it again., Great.  Let me know if you find anything.  Otherwise, I'll check on removing one of the two files - it's not clear to me right now how the webconsole can be used outside of the broker, so there may be an impact to removing one., Don't know why, I can't reproduce it.]
