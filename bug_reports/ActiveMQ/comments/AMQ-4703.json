[I'm working on it., I checked in the activemq-osgi bundle, and the META-INF/native folder doesn't exist. I'm reviewing the build of activemq-osgi bundle., This patch remove the native statements to use the Java driver., If activemq feature installs correctly with this patch, the default activemq.xml broker configuration is missing. I'm adding this., I checked in ActiveMQ 5.7.0, and the activemq.xml was not provided in the deploy folder by the activemq feature. It's the responsibility of the user to drop the activemq.xml in the deploy folder., I'm testing the activemq-broker feature., activemq-broker feature works fine:

- karaf@root> activemq:list 
brokerName = amq-broker

- karaf@root> activemq:bstat

TotalConsumerCount = 0
Uptime = 1 minute
TotalDequeueCount = 0
BrokerName = amq-broker
TotalEnqueueCount = 1
TotalMessageCount = 0

Name = KahaDBPersistenceAdapter[/home/jbonofre/apache-karaf-2.3.1/data/amq-broker/kahadb]

connectorName = openwire

- karaf@root> web:list
   ID   State         Web-State       Level  Web-ContextPath           Name
[ 121] [Active     ] [Deployed   ]  [   50] [/activemqweb            ] activemq-web-console (5.9.0.SNAPSHOT)

But, when I access to http://localhost:8181/activemqweb, I got an error in the ActiveMQ webconsole:

2013-09-11 11:18:40,958 | WARN  | qtp925448244-86  | ServletHandler                   | pse.jetty.servlet.ServletHandler  514 | 58 - org.eclipse.jetty.util - 7.6.8.v20121106 | /activemqweb/index.jsp
javax.el.ELException: java.lang.RuntimeException: java.io.IOException: Failed to retrieve RMIServer stub: javax.naming.CommunicationException [Root exception is java.rmi.UnmarshalException: error unmarshalling return; nested exception is: 

The etc/org.apache.activemq.webconsole.cfg defines the correct properties used by the webconsole. I gonna take a look on that.
, Works fine now]
