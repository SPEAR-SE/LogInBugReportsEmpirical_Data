[JBoss server log, @Gaston I think your issue is fixed by http://svn.apache.org/r1504279
the only caveat is that my use case does not need a call to another ejb. The scenario was an MDB spending longer than the TM timeout in onMessage so that the CMT had aborted on its return from onMessage. That was enough to loose a message through an auto ack in a local transaction. All in error.

Can you try out tonights snapshot to verify?
many thanks :-), It's working!
Thanks., thanks for the verification.]
