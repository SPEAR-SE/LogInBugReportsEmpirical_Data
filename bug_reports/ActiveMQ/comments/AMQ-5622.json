[Are you using STOMP client in 1.1+ mode or a STOMP 1.0 client.  If only using 1.0 then you still need to have matching values as the 1.0 specification doesn't support uniquely identifying a subscription using an 'id' value.  , It works as expected but only with STOMP 1.1 (in my client library). 

If I modify the ActiveMQ test Stomp11Test.testDurableSubAndUnSubOnTwoTopics to use STOMP 1.2 it fails to find the subscription ("test1"):

String connectFrame = "STOMP\n" +
                "login:system\n" + "passcode:manager\n" + "accept-version:1.2\n" +
                "host:localhost\n" + "client-id:test\n" + "\n" + Stomp.NULL;



2015-03-02 17:37:11,730 [0.1:49541@49534] - WARN  ProtocolConverter              - Exception occurred processing: 
UNSUBSCRIBE
activemq.subscriptionName:test1
receipt:3
destination:/topic/org.apache.activemq.transport.stomp.Stomp11Test.testDurableSubAndUnSubOnTwoTopics1
id:durablesub-1

It should work in the same way with both protocol versions (1.1 and 1.2) if I understand the 1.2 protocol changes correctly


, I'll take a look at it, I would expect it to work in 1.2 as well.  , Fix this and a couple other minor issues with the 1.2 support, tests added]
