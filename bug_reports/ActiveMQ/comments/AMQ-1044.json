[Fixed in trunk rev 474769 and in 4.1 branch rev 474771, I saw this problem happen in 5.0 as well as snapshots of 5.1.
I get this error:
WARNING: Failed to register MBean: org.apache.activemq:BrokerName=embeddedbroker,Type=Topic,Destination=ActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Queue.ID_1586- ...

I do have memory leaks as well as ActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Queue accumulation.

here are the objects which are leaking:
org.apache.activemq.filter.DestinationMapNode
org.apache.activemq.filter.SimpleDestinationFilter
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.policy.SimpleDispatchPolicy
 org.apache.activemq.broker.region.policy.SharedDeadLetterStrategy
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.policy.NoSubscriptionRecoveryPolicy
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Topic$1
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Topic
org.apache.activemq.broker.region.DestinationStatistics
org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.TopicView

 org.apache.activemq.usage.MemoryUsage
org.apache.activemq.usage.DefaultUsageCapacity
org.apache.activemq.management.PollCountStatisticImpl

, The connection shutdown code is now guaranteed to run when service requests are not being serviced.  This eliminates the timing issues related to shutting down connections.]
