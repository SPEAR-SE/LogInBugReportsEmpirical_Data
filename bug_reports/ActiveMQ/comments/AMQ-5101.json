[Patch with unit test attached. , I applied the patch http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/ac23b017

However, I'm seeing quite regular failings of testResendMessageId test now

It's probably due the timeouts introduced in the test, but nevertheless it might be good to investigate, Have you seen any more failures since all the other fixes for MQTT have gone in, seems stable here.  , Test appears to be stable now with all the other MQTT fixes that have gone in.  Can reopen if things change.  ]
