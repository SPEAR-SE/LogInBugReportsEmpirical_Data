[The documentation on that page calls out the methods as being added to 5.13.1 which has not been released yet so they are not available in 5.13.0.  , Ah I read "That's why starting with version 5.13.0....", but missed the "5.13.1" later on.  Regardless, is there anyway to get ActiveMQ 5.13.0 to work? I tried -Dorg.apache.activemq.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES="*" as well as "org" and that both do not work. , Disregard. -Dorg.apache.activemq.SERIALIZABLE_PACKAGES="*" worked, just had syntax wrong.]
