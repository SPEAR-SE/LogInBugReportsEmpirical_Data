[Fix applied in trunk, the reply-to destinations will be set to the same as what was given in the original message.  The remote names shouldn't leak from the Stomp transport.  Test case added., Wow, thanks for such a quick response! Just want to check my understanding of your fix. Does it mean the received MESSAGE with reply-to ( received as a result of the SEND) will now have reply-to = '/temp-queue/...' or '/temp-topic/...'? 

What about the case where two connections are used (one connection owns the temporary destination and emits the SEND with reply-to, a second connection receives the MESSAGE). Presumably in that case the reply-to would have to be '/remote-temp-queue/...' or '/remote-temp-topic/...' since the temporary destination actually belongs to the other connection?, From the client side the replyTo destination's parent connection should be opaque, so all connections would receive the same /temp-topic/ or /temp-queue/ values.  Its up to your clients to ensure that the name's of the temp destinations that they create are unique, using a UUID for instance.  The remote prefix is used internally by amq to match up its own destination structures and shouldn't have been leaking out of the Stomp transport.  ]
