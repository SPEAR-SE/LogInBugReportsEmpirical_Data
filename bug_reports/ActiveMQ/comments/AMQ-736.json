[The problem is not in the broker, but in JournalMessageStore. Whet JoiurnalMessageStore is performing checkpoint, consumers doesn't receive messages during that checkpoint. 
The bug is that during checkpoint, messages are removed from cpAddedMessageIds list, and as I understand, this is temporal message store used during checkpoint. And during checkpoint messages shouldn't be removed from there, because consumer is using this member to get messages, which are already removed from short term storage, but not yet added to long term storage. So fix is preatty simple.
I'm adding the patch against the main trunk of ActiveMQ.
Hope some ActiveMQ developers will take a look., Have committed your test case - many thanks for that - its here...

https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator/activemq/trunk/activemq-core/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/bugs/SlowConsumerTest.java

I made one or two minor changes (using a name local to the test case for the queue to avoid tests treading on each others toes and failing rather than hanging if enough messages are not returned in time). The test case works fine on OS X - both before my changes and after them - before applying your patch to fix the test case. Will investigate further, Patch and test case applied - many thanks!, added patch available flag]
