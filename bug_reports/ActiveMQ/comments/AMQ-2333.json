[This just happened w/ only 142 messages in a queue, investigate turning off producer flow control and increasing the memory available to the broker through the systemUsage config., OK, I'm going to try the systemUsage first. Here's my current config:
{panel}
        <!--  The maximum about of space the broker will use before slowing down producers -->
        <systemUsage>
            <systemUsage>
                <memoryUsage>
                    <memoryUsage limit="20 mb"/>
                </memoryUsage>
                <storeUsage>
                    <storeUsage limit="1 gb" name="foo"/>
                </storeUsage>
                <tempUsage>
                    <tempUsage limit="100 mb"/>
                </tempUsage>
            </systemUsage>
        </systemUsage>
{panel}

Switching it to:

{panel}
  <memoryUsage limit="50 mb"/>
  <tempUsage limit="500 mb"/>
{panel}

Hopefully that will fix the problem - will let you know shortly., The configuration changes that I made fixed our problem. Thank you for the help!]
