{code}, [~cshannon] this is a showstopper for us upgrading from 5.10 -  could we get a fix for this into 5.13?, If you don't run with assertions turned on, does your use case work? 

It seems like the only fix here is to just drop the assertion line because I can't really think of a good reason not to allow multiple composite destinations to route to the same queue. In fact, I have done this several times but never noticed this problem because I don't use assertions accept during unit testing., Hi, yep passes with asserts disabled. We don't run our application with assertions turned on in production but we do for UAT and unit tests so would be good to get this fixed. Obviously the concern was that [~tabish121] added that assert to trap some undesirable edge case. If removing it is valid we'd be happy with this fix.

Thanks,

(cherry picked from commit 35b7ac250b5fa0b8c8dbf728881cc9dbf6edce19)
, I have applied a patch for this because the assertion doesn't make any sense to me to have it in there.

Thanks for the test case [~furn], I have applied a modified version of it to this patch to make sure that this doesn't happen again., Great, thanks for your help., Commit 95f58fa7c4e26b5b2d73a80bd8e1cb2bee8ebf47 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

Adding back in test case now that AMQ-5898 is resolved
