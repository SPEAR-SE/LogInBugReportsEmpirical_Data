[When the durable subscribers are not receiving their messages and they are staying on the spoke broker, is the network bridge established between the brokers still? Or is the network bridge itself disconnected?

If the network bridge is re-stablished after the outage but the durables are not getting messages then this might be helped by a new feature I added in 5.14.x.  There's a new flag on the network connector that can be set that is called "syncDurableSubs".  You would need to upgrade to 5.14.1 to try this flag however., Thanks for your prompt response. Yes, the network is clear after the outage, but the messages are not flowing across the bridge. 
When I check the subscribers page on activemq web console, they still show up under offline durable subscriber section. 
I will review the fix in 5.14.1. Thanks for the advise. , The original fix was in 5.14.0 but there was a bug fixed with it in 5.14.1.  I haven't had a chance to document the new feature yet but the two relevant Jiras are:

https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6373
https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6423

Not sure this is your problem in this case but it might be.  The durable sync will happen on a network bridge restart so after the outage the sync would happen on reconnect.]
