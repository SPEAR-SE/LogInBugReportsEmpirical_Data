[Tracking the code path, it appears BrokerSupport.doResend() is used to copy and resend the message.

Even though the message is copied, the message id is not changed.  Is it safe to modify that method to change the message id after copying?  What use-case exists for keeping the same message id?, Anyone have thoughts on this?  My concern is the code path leads to a more centralized method that may be used in many places, making it hard to validate the change for all paths., I have often wondered about the usecase but have concluded that the id is implicit in the resend. If the id is changed it is a resend copy type op. So not the same message. Duplicate detection is based on the id.
Maybe a unit test of the doresend op will help clarify. To my mind a resend that results in a duplicate is an error.  But I would expect a resend to rollback the audit as appropriate. ]
