[This seems valid, a test case and a supplied patch to resolved the issue would be a nice contribution.  , Attached patch, and junit., Simplified the test case and patch a little and applied.  Thanks!, Hi Tim,

Thanks for the feedback.  Just wondering, should that else statement do a remove from the map; rather than the get?

{noformat}
} else {
182 	durableSubscriptions.get(key);
183 	} 
{noformat}

i.e. 

{noformat}
} else {
182 	durableSubscriptions.remove(key);
183 	} 
{noformat}


cheers
/dom, Good catch, fixed it.]
