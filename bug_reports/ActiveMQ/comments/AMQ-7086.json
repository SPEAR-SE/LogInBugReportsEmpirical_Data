[The checkpoint=0 use case is from: AMQ-3646

disabling gc on shutdown will need to be configurable I think., [~gtully] my .02 is making it configurable is the way to go., Commit bf8eb08acaeec653d04daa0b8b6dd889ef990bed in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from gtully

AMQ-7086 - make kahadb gc/cleanup on shutdown optional to trade availability over disk usage for fast failover
, new kahaDB boolean attribute: 

cleanupOnStop - default to true as before.

When disabled, the gc/cleanup iteration on broker stop won't happen, which will speed up shutdown.

Use case is with really large db or scheduler db where total index traversal is not cheap.]
