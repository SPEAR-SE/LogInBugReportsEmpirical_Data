[An update:

I changed the code so, that each consumer and producer don't use the same connection-object. So that each consumer and each producer has its own connection, which creates a session, which creates the consumer/producer - in case of a consumer after the creation the connection was started.

Unfortunately that all did not help. Messages are still delivered multiple times.

So has anybody been free for looking at this?]
