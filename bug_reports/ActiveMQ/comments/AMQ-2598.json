[I did some debugging and the problem seems to be caused by org.apache.activemq.network.DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceAdd() method where it calls "connectUri = URISupport.applyParameters(connectUri, parameters);" 

Note in the output included in the description of this issue, the "INFO | Establishing network connection" reports the query parameters twice and inccludes ")" at the end.  That duplication and the addition of the ")" to the end of the last parameter is caused by the applyParameters() call. I found that if I comment that call out, every thing works fine. (Commenting out that code is probably not the correct solution.  Maybe the problem is with what ever code populated the "parameters" HashMap that is being passed to the applyParameters() method? At any rate, I just wanted to note what I've found so far.), Fixed with svn revision 984826

Just a note that it won't work with the url you're using

static://(http://gstest-252:61617?proxyHost=gstest-252&amp;proxyPort=80)

You need to use

static:(http://gstest-252:61617?proxyHost=gstest-252&amp;proxyPort=80)

which is a properly formatted composite url., Thanks, we will update our activemq.xml files accordingly.  I actually got that from the examples on http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html.  You'll note that the first couple of examples show it the way you suggest but the examples further down have "static://.   ]
