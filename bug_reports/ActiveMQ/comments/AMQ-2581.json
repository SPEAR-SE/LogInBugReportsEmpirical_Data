[Same issue for me with
- JBoss AS 5.1.0
- Sun JDK 1.6.0_18
- Windows XP SP3 32-bit, same here

* tomcat 5.5.28
* solaris 10
* servicemix/activemq
* Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_07-b06), The old web console is deprecated. From 5.9 there is a new console that works in Tomcat and other containers., the old webconsole is deprecated... 
what do you expect ... the bug was open for 3.5 years. 
ActiveMQ will soon be deprecated.]
