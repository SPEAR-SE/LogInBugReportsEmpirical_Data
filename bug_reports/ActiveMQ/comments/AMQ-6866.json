[it seems the  Queue and the Topic dispatch the message at the same time, add the Command(MessageDispatch) to the dispatchQueue(in TransportConnection: line 947), then wakeup the taskrunner.

the queue send thread (Task 95) add the command to the dispatchQueue first,  the topic send thread(ActiveMQ Transport: ssl:///220.51.13.57:44446) add the command later, but the topic send thread wakeup the taskRunner first and then get the Queue MessageDispatch from the dispatchQueue, after dispatched it invoke the TransmitCallback's onSuccess method, then the deadlock occurs., long time before this, in the activemq server log , we always see something like this: The connection to 'xxx' is taking a long time to shutdown.
but why the connection is being shutdown, we cannot find it out from the log.

, of interest is the rejected handler, suggesting that the thread pool is constrained. 
at java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$CallerRunsPolicy.rejectedExecution(ThreadPoolExecutor.java:2022)

Does the org.apache.activemq.thread.TaskRunnerFactory.maximumPoolSize system property get configured, if so changing the value may workaround., We indeed configured the max pool size of task runner factory. After we remove it, this problem has been fixed.Thanks a lot.But still i think it's maybe a bug in some case, do you agree?, there are many possibilities to configure a broker that won't work well in some scenario. that is the down side to having flexibility of configuration; there needs to be a full understanding of the tradeoffs in changing configuration values and testing that validates assumptions.
I don't think this is a bug but having this issue capture a use case that can be broken in this way may help others.]
