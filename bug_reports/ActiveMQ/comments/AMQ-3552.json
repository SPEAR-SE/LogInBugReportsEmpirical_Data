[Hi JB,

This issue already get fixed by AMQ-3247 and SMX4-784.
With this fix the output is

karaf@root> activemq:list 
Connecting to JMX URL: service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-root
BrokerName = default


Freeman, Thanks for the update Freeman. I tried with ActiveMQ 5.5.0 on Karaf 2.2.4. I will try using ActiveMQ 5.6.0 SNAPSHOT to check if it's fixed (outside ServiceMix)., As I mentioned AMQ-3247 and SMX4-784 work together fixed it, so besides use Activemq 5.6-SNAPSHOT you also need
add
 
+#
+# Activemq JMX configuration
+#
+activemq.jmx.url=service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:1099/karaf-${karaf.name}
+activemq.jmx.user=smx
+activemq.jmx.password=smx
+
+
to karaf etc/system.properties to make it work.

Freeman, resolving based on freeman's comments. thanks.]
