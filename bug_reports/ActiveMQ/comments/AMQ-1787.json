[The same underlying problem as was fixed for https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1774, With a producer producing object messages with message expiration set to 5 seconds, we are seeing no messages sent to consumer when messages start to expire and put into DLQ.  Due to some issue between the ActiveMQ RA and SJSAS 9.1, our consumer's prefetch is set to 100.  We are using a queue, which the prefetch should be defaulted to 1000.  We are seeing this "hanging" appearance in 5.3.1., This should have all been resolved with the addition of the purge of inactive destination along with other fixes for this type of issue.  ]
