Read the comments of AMQ-1868, it helps.

When the producer blocks, it is usually because of it reaches memoryLimit:

use the following and producer side will get an exception.

<systemUsage>

 <systemUsage sendFailIfNoSpace="true">

   <memoryUsage>

     <memoryUsage limit="20 mb">

   </memoryUsage>

 </systemUsage>

</systemUsage>, I wish Activemq can have a troubleshoot guide for common issues. 

I run into several which is due to configuration and extra digging and have to extensive research to find out. Things like:

1. for network of brokers, you have to set networkTTL correctly, otherwise it will not  pass message along

2. the default multicast port is 239.255.2.3 port 6155  you have to look at here:
http://wirelessness.wordpress.com/2007/02/02/iptables-and-activemq/
in the corporate environment, there is firewall, if you don't open the ports, brokers will not be able to discover each other

3. other java default nasty things like jmx rmi is opening two ports, one fixed, one random, so you need to do customize jmx agent to make it two fixed ports and ask your admin to open those ports on firewall.

... the list goes on. Please start it and i can volunteer to add on to it and it will save people's time and will not scare people who is evaluating this product without doing much research thus we have a broader user case. ]
