[Timestamps are set on the client. Are you sure the clocks on the producer machines are synced? 

If you have no control over the client machines you could use the timestamp plugin

http://activemq.apache.org/timestampplugin.html, Timestamps are not used for sorting the visual order of messages in the web console. , Thanks Trace and Bruce.
I have already used timestampplugin but the problem is the same.
Bruce, what is the role played by Timestamps of a message?

When the only consumer consumes a message it records in database table the message and the timestamp associate with it (behalf      Message.getJMSTimestamp ()) and I think: If i order by timestamp the records in the table, I obtain the same message order as it was in the queue.
I want to preserve the order behalf timestamp setted by the broker.
 
Is it possible? Or I have to solve in another way?

Thanks in advance.

Vincenzo, The web consolejust uses JMX and a queue browser to look into the broker to get a peek at the messages at that particular instant. The web console is not concerned with order of the messages and is completely separate from message consumption. 

Are you seeking to consume the messages in the order that they were received by the broker? If so, check out [total ordering with the strict order dispatch policy|http://activemq.apache.org/total-ordering.html]. That is a broker feature that must be configured in the {{activemq.xml}}. It will not affect the display of messages in the web console, only the order in which messages are dispatched to the a consumer subscription. , This doesn't appear to be a problem, just a lack of configuration for the desired results., reopen to set fix version to 5.6, closing again with correct fix version]
