[it is by design because the jdbc store does not have an index.

Â 

the broker.xml destinations list is a way to persist queues, there is an export option. but it won't help for dynamic systems., Gary,

the fact that "because the jdbc store does not have an index" - isn't something I can change via config, is it ?

Persisting queues might be an option in my use case but, yes, not if queue names are not known beforehead - and actually very uncomfortable to maintain in the long run.

It might be a good idea if the ActiveMQ documentation / website ([http://activemq.apache.org/jdbc-master-slave.html] ) actually could mention this lack of feature (when compared to KahaDB)

Since I'm in AWS, I will try with EFS + LDL on my db for locking.
