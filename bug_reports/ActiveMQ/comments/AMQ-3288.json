[Fix in http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1095352

Delay caused by store recovery ignoring batch size on a priority boundary, thus being limited only by memory resources.
Encountered some additional problems related to out-of-order delivery and missed messages with immediatePriorityDispatch on memory boundaries. In addition, some over eager cleanup when priority and non priority destinations are mixed. All of these are now fixed.]
