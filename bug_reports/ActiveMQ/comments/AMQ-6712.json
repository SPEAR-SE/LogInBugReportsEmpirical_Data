[Am using activemq-all-5.11.0.jar in my project, 5.11.0 is very old, you should first try using a newer version (such as 5.14.5).  If that doesn't work then try getting help on the ActiveMQ users mailing list to see if it is a configuration issue or some other issue with your environment.  If it is later determined it is a bug or if you can create a test case to show the issue then you can reopen the Jira issue.
