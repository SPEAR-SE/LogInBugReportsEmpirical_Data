[ receive()  and receive(timeout ) now return null on transport failure - so consistent behaviour with a close() on the connection., receive() and receive(-1) should never return null. They should block until a message is received or throw an exception if interrupted (either by a close() or a Thread.interrupt())., receive() will return null if there's a concurrent close - where do you get the idea that receive() should never return null?
ie. the API docs says:  Returns:
        the next message produced for this message consumer, or null if this message consumer is concurrently closed 
, It does appear we're compliant with the JMS specification so am closing this issue.]
