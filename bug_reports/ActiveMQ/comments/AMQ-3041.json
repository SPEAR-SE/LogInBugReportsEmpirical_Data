[After some debugging I see that when the temprary queue is created it call:


ManagedTempQueueRegion.createDestination(....)

But when call TemporaryQueue.delete() it never call;:

 ManagedTempQueueRegion.removeDestination(....)

I still try to understand why, I just wrote a unit test to see if the issue still exist. I can not reproduce it with latest trunk. Anyway here is the unit test maybe you want to add it, Test case committed with svn revision 1061296. Thanks!]
