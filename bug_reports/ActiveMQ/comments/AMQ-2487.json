[Patch file attached. It is worth investigating if there are other problematic scenarios where BrokerRegion.doResend might be using the wrong MemoryUsage, resolve in r835325, modified an existing test to verify., moveMessages and other jmx operations seem to suffer from the same memory usage reuse issue. need to track those down and fix them before closing this., resolved in r882096 - some more validation of memory usage and fix issue with storequeuecursor and browse effecting memory usage.]
