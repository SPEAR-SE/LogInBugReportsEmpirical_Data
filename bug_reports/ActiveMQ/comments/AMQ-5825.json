[A TreeSet might work here to replace the ArrayList so that insertions are done in O(log n) and are sorted already.  The one issue is that the comparator would need to be updated to make sure that if priority is not set (aka returns 0), that the comparator could then compare the Subscriptions in some other way to find out if they are unique otherwise the Set would think two Subscriptions were a duplicate and not add the second one.  Would need to test out a bunch of cases to make sure a change like this wouldn't break anything., TreeSet will only work if you do what I suggest about keeping the index of the current "first" element, because we manually reorder the List (which is why it needs to be a List as currently implemented).  So yes, if you do that, TreeSet would simplify the sorted insertion, but otherwise you have to stick with List.]
