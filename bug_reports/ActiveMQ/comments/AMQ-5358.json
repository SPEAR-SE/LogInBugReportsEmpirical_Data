[JUnit test case for MQTT Durable subscription test using MQTT Paho client library., JUnit test case for MQTT durable subscriptions using MQTT Paho client library., When you say, "does not work" what behavior are you expecting and what do you actually see?, The proper behavior is that messages that are published to consumers that are offline should be delivered to the consumers when they eventually come online. 

What I have observed is that the messages are not delivered when the consumers come online. I have verified that the messages do get published to the topic (using the web console).

The same test case is successful when I run broker version 5.9.0.

, Ran your test against 5.11-SNAPSHOT and it passes without incident.  , I just downloaded apache-activemq-5.11-20140914.222907-84-bin.tar.gz and ran default broker without any change. My test case failed.
If I replace the broker with 5.9.0, it works. 
What could I be doing wrong?, Your subscription is actually only set to AT_MOST_ONCE so no durable subscription is created.  , my mistake. Didn't realize that QoS 0 messages are not stored. Thanks for your help!, I believe there is still an issue here. The MQTT spec clearly says that the message should be stored if it is published with QoS >0. In other words, it does not depend on the subscription QoS.

This means that even if client1 made a durable subscription with QoS 0 and if client2 published a message with QoS >0, then client1 should receive it. In my observation, this did not happen and is not compliant with the spec.

Please verify., You'd need to confirm that with the MQTT spec folks in whatever forum they reside, I don't think the spec is wrong. I meant that the MQTT implementation in ActiveMQ does not conform to the spec in this regard.]
