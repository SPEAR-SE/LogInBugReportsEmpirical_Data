[We are running ActiveMQ 5.10.0 with network of 2 brokers here at Carnegie Mellon and see CPU usage spike to 100% from time to time.  We are however unable to reproduce this issue in test environment.  We would be very interested in any updates on this issue., I was able to consistently reproduce the problem with the set-up described in the ticket above.
It looks like a bug in the code for this failure-mode case.

I currently don't have the knowledge or time to attempt to fix the bug.
I believe the best chance is to raise the awareness and visibility of this bug on development boards.

Perhaps you could also make a post in the AMQ user forum. http://activemq.apache.org/user-forum.html
Thanks!, Could this be related to AMQ-5605?, I did some rework or AMQ-4485 because of AMQ-5266. Part of that was to fix up the counters/stats if the store traps a duplicate;
see: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/85b9c81a3f2431b8272c19acf4e4b1cddeb25c5e/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java#L770

If the counters are correct the spin probably can be avoided so I think this may not reproduce on 5.11.0, No test case provided, no feedback against later broker releases with related bug fixes to the indicated problem area.  ]
