[Curious if you see the same on 5.3.1 ?, I just tried this with 5.3.1 and yes, I see the same thing with the MemoryPercentUsage reaching 225., BTW - I tried this using 5.3.2 and the current 5.4 snapshot and see similar behavior to that mentioned above., Closing for now.  Should try this against a newer broker release and see if you can still reproduce it, if so a JUnit test case the demonstrates the problem would be key to finding the issue.]
