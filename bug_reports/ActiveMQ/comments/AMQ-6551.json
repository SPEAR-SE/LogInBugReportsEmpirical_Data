[I attach you a sample program to reproduce the pb., The problem is present when I use a virtual topic with 5 consumers, When the exception occurd, we can see that th message take less than 30ms to go to the server, and when the server send the response, the temporary queue has already been destoyed (but the client is already blocked on the "receive" method and dont have destroyed th temporary queue).

I don't know if it is possible to the server to get the message before the creation of the temporary queue ?

In the same way, the client exit in timeout because the server never get the message !!

The three file reproduce the pb.

, Like I say in previous post, the pb is that the server receive the message before the temporary queue was created.

If we replace the "send" part in the file "AsyncListener" whit this code who wait 500ms after an error to resend the message, we don't have error on the second send.

		try {
			producer.send(returnMessage);
		}
		catch (Exception e) {
			System.out.println("Error : " + e);
			e.printStackTrace(System.out);
			//on retest apr√®s avoir attendu 500 ms
			Thread.sleep(500);
			try {
				System.out.println("new test for :" + tmpDestination);
				producer.send(returnMessage);
			}
			catch (Exception e2) {
				System.out.println("New error : " + e2);
				e.printStackTrace(System.out);
			}
		}, Is it possible to know if the temporary queue is created ?, I have the same problem. But, it is caused by broker property 
 advisorySupport="false" in activemq.xml
But, when advisorySupport="true", each temp queues create an advisory topic and overflow limit for topics quantity.]
