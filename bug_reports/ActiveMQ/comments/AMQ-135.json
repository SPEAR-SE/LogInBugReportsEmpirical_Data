[The attachments to this issue were lost in the jira migration.  Therefore I was not able to see the test case and reproduce.  If this is still a problem please re-open and reatach the test case.

As a side note:  Please be aware that at the current time the queue browser can not be used conncurently with a queue consumer (the browser will not see the messages prefetched by the consumer)., re-opening to set right resolution.]
