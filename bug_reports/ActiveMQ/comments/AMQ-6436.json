[sample and sample data. message.txt should go into c:\temp, This happens because the temporary store is lazily initialized the first time it is needed which is only after there are enough non-persistent messages to fill up memory so that the messages need to be dumped to disk.  So on restart the old directory isn't touched until initialization.  However, it probably wouldn't hurt to clear out the temp store directory on first start up., Commit a82c95cd29a6b06d2083b1869129b9e2addac7da in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

The temporary store will now delete the old temp directory on start up
if lazyInit is true instead of waiting for the store to initialize to
clear up space.  This prevents space on the disk from being wasted with
old data if the temp store isn't initialized
