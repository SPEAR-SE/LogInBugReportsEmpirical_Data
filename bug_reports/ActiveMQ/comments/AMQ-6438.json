JMS Transformer performance improvements and bug fixes

Trim unnecessary code and improve overall performance of the JMS
Transformer codecs.  Remove legacy Qpid JMS client related code from the
transformer as these are no longer supported.  Fix outgoing message that
do not match the structure of the incoming message that created them such
as message with had only a body being sent out with Headers and message
Properties.
