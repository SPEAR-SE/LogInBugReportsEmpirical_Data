[here is the configuration for network connection:

            <networkConnector name="external01_01" conduitSubscriptions="false" uri="static://(tcp://10.102.44.181:61616)" userName="MQ-PRD-ADMIN" password="${connector.password}">
                <excludedDestinations>
                    <topic physicalName="VirtualTopic.>"/>
                </excludedDestinations>
            </networkConnector>
, Here is the datasource configuration:
    <bean id="mysql-ds" class="org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource" destroy-method="close">
       <property name="driverClassName" value="com.mysql.jdbc.Driver"/>
       <property name="url" value="jdbc:mysql://*.*.*.*:3306/activemq?relaxAutoCommit=true"/>
       <property name="username" value="ACTIVEMQSERVER"/>
       <property name="password" value="${jdbc.password}"/>
       <property name="poolPreparedStatements" value="true"/>
    </bean>
, And I don't think stopping networkConnector due to SQLExeption or IOException is a reasonable behavior. At least there should be some kind of retry mechanism to make networkConnector alive even such kind of exceptions happened., Normally the simple discovery agent allows reconnecting after the bridge failed for some events.
You can tune some reconnect parameters (http://activemq.apache.org/networks-of-brokers.html)

Since you have an exception occurred for the persistence adapter, did the whole broker shut down?, No, the broker can still work properly after this exception happened, but the network connector stopped.]
