[Increased timeout in commit 982b728f24415513a18cb51097b5a10d2f9b66db, This is still failing in a couple of places, most recently .testValidateRedeliveryCountOnRollback and testRedeliveryWithPrefetch1.  I've seen this in some other tests where it seems like broker.stop in tearDown() doesn't really wait for everything to shut down, even if you call waitUntilStopped.

All of the tests are fine if run alone.  I'll add a short sleep at the end of the tearDown() to take care of this.
