[Fixed in svn revision 832701 

Incidentally, the patch that sorts tables on first column by default is added (thanks to Nishant - http://old.nabble.com/Admin-Console:-Sort-on-Queue-name-td25440691.html#a25440691), I had added this fix about a month ago and didn't pay too much attention to it. We changed to fuse 5.3 and I noticed a javascript error on the page. Perhaps this does not affect amq 5.3 but I bet it does.

The JS error is:

"opt_whenDone is not a function"

This occurs on the topics and queues pages. The fix is mentioned on the prettify.js page:

"
I get an error message "a is not a function" or "opt_whenDone is not a function"

If you are calling prettyPrint via an event handler, wrap it in a function. Instead of doing

addEventListener('load', prettyPrint, false);
wrap it in a closure like
addEventListener('load', function (event) { prettyPrint() }, false);
so that the browser does not pass an event object to prettyPrint which will confuse it. 
"

Also.. when you click the "home" link on the admin page.. you get a different error:

"document.getElementsByTagName("TH")[0] is undefined"

I just made a quick fix... so there is probably something better to do... I changed the following:

var e = {};
var obj = document.getElementsByTagName("TH")[0].firstChild;
e.target = obj;
standardistaTableSorting.headingClicked(e);  // will sort Ascending 

to:

if(window.location.hostname.indexOf("index.jsp") != -1)
{
    var e = {};
    var obj = document.getElementsByTagName("TH")[0].firstChild; 
    e.target = obj;
    standardistaTableSorting.headingClicked(e);  // will sort Ascending 
}, Using fuse 5.3 showed JS errors on the page. I had not noticed them in the past with amq 5.3... but I may have been running it out of firebug. I would imagine the same javascript errors exist., Sorry... wasn't thinking... the fix for the "home" page above wouldn't work... change:

if(window.location.hostname.indexOf("index.jsp") != -1)

to:

if(window.location.href.indexOf("index.jsp") === -1), Fixed in svn revision 906416.

I used 

{code}if (document.getElementsByTagName("TH")[0] != null) {
...
}{code}

to filter out pages where sorting isn't needed.

Thanks for the patches.]
