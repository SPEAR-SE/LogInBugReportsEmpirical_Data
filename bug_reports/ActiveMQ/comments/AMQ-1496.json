[Not Fiexed!, Unable to change the prefetch value associated with a queue.
Please take a look at this issue again.
The ActiveMQ web console shows the prefetch value as 100 instead of 1000 or any other value specified in the ra.xml or broker-config.xml in the ActiveMQ Resource Adapter.  This is supposed to be fixed in 5.0.0, but appears in version 5.3.1.
, Is this for an inbound connection to an MDB? Please add some more detail.

For an inbound connection, the prefetch is the product of maxMessagesPerSessions and maxSessions
see:

, Thanks for the information.  Changing the default settings of maxMessagesPerSessions and maxSessions worked.]
