[I'm getting the same error using Hermes JMS 1.10/1.12/1.13...  that uses activemq jms client:

This is the stackTrace:

Thanks,
Leonardo, I receive the same exception on my JMS client., I have also been running into this same issue. My setup using JMSAppender for Log4j, ActiveMQ 5.1, 5.2, and a beta 5.3 version all work fine from most of my webapps, but my Appfuse 2.0.2 spring based application seems to have this problem using exactly the same activemq and log4j versions and jar files., Restarting the server seems to "fix" the problem. It just happened with me today, my client application suddenly stopped working reporting this exception when creating a session.

This seems to be a server related problem, maybe both client and server.

Gabriel, It would be help full to see a thread dump from the server when this occurs.
A typical instance where this occurs is when the client connects to a port that is not an activemq tcp transport endpoint. The client can connect, but it cannot complete its handshake and times out. 
An alternative is where the server is overloaded and the accept thread cannot start due to lack of resources or is really slow to start. In this case, extending the handshake/wireformat timeout [option|http://activemq.apache.org/tcp-transport-reference.html| should help but it may be best to use a network of brokers to partition the load.
In any event, a server side thread dump should help diagnose.
, I had a similar error on the client side:

All I have is the stack trace on the client:

I confirm that restarting the server fixes it (for some time I guess).

, Hi guys.

We found out that the problem occurred when the server was using a "remote syslog" adapter (log4j). When (for some reason) the adapter fails the server presents this behavior. 

It looks like some kind of exception not correctly handled or something.

Gabriel, I put up a FAQ entry that covers this topic, causes and workarounds http://activemq.apache.org/javaxjmsjmsexception-wire-format-negociation-timeout-peer-did-not-send-his-wire-format.html so I'll resolve this issue for now. Also take a look at this entry http://activemq.apache.org/how-do-i-use-log4j-jms-appender-with-activemq.html is you're using log4j jms appender]
