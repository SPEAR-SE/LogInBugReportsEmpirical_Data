[My attempt at writing a JUnit test for this.
I used JUnit 3 as it seemed to be the version used for the ActiveMQ in the source package.

Unfortunately since this seems to be a timing issue it might not be able to provoke the problem every time.
So it should be run multiple times to increase the chance of detecting the problem.

A warning might be in place, when it does succeed in provoking the error it will leave empty TempQueues lying around in the broker.

Nimos, I know this issue was raised on 4.x - but also found on 5.3.0 - but I have not been able to reproduce after many tries on trunk. 
Added a test case - org.apache.activemq.bugs.AMQ2571 by SVN revision 901832, I am still able to reproduce the problem on the 5.4 snapshot downloaded today from the ActiveMQ page:
http://activemq.apache.org/download.html
I ran the JUnit test case 10 times which resulted in 5 failures => 5 consumerless TempQueues lying around indefinetly (or actually until broker restart) in the broker. It might be that I have a slow computer, but the problem is there.

So I can't consider this fixed in the 5.4 version available at ActiveMQ homepage.

Best Regards
Simon, Fixed misspelling (Settings -> Setting)., luckily I have a slow laptop so have been able to validate it there, Fixed by SVN revision 905926]
