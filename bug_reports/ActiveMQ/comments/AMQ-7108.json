[I've attached our broker configuration., Just a thought and I haven't looked into the activemq code in detail but it seems like the data kahadb is reading in is incorrect which may indicate that a race condition occurred writing the data to disk.  i.e. is it possible that a KahaAddScheduledJobCommand and a KahaTraceCommand were stored at the same time and were given the same primary key?, You need to test using the latest release (5.15.8) as your version is quite old and is not supported.  It's rather likely this issue has already been fixed in a newer release. ]
