[The is caused by org.apache.activemq.filter.LogicExpression, in this lines:

You see comment "//Can we do an AND shortcut??"?
That's the cause of that bug.

When left value is unknown method returns null. That's incorrect. You should check if right value is false and return false in that case., I can create a pull-request on github with fix and some more test, if that OK with you., It does seem like we don't fully follow the mandated behaviour.  The first thing to do is create or add a test to the existing unit tests that demonstrates the error.  There is a selector test class (SelectorTest.java) you could add to and then supply a patch that corrects the issue.  By adding a test you have confidence that the fix will remain into the future., GitHub user traylz opened a pull request:
