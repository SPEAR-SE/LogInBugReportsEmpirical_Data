[With AMQ-4209 the following would happen:

Bridges would be configured with the excluded/dynamicallyIncluded/staticallyIncluded destinations that were private to NetworkConnector. But getDestinationFilter would be called on NetworkBridgeConfiguration and that would use the dynamicallyIncludedDestinations that was local to itself (which would usually just be empty). This would lead to always allowing ALL consumers on the bridge instead of those "dynamically included" which would be the source for the destinationFilter.
