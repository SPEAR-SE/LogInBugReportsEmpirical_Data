[Hi,

Can you post the complete stacktrace for this exception?

Thanks., I've added a fix for rev. 629060

The behavior would be that if a jms property is encountered with a null value, it will not be converted to the ActiveMQ property, but will still be maintained in the list of jms properties. Let me know if this behavior works for you.]
