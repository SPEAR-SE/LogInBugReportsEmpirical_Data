[This is issue will be resolved in 5.3 by using the KahaDB, Do you know if there is a fix for this when using jdbcPersistenceAdapter? 

I'm using 5.4.2 broker with jdbcPersistenceAdapter and was able to reproduce this bug. I created a Consumer.*.VirtualTopic.FOO and published a message to VirtualTopic.FOO with Persistent Delivery. Message correctly got to the queue and then I restarted the broker. Now the queue and the message are gone. When I query ACTIVEMQ_MSGS table, I see the message and the queue but upon restarting broker does not pick that up.

Tried the same with KahaDB and that works., can you validate 5.5.0 for the jdbc persistence adapter and open a new issue if you still see a problem?, The same issue exists in 5.5 broker.

Just to note: Both 5.4.2 and 5.5 will show the message in the database once you create the queue (Consumer.MyClient.VirtualTopic.FOO) manually. Then all messages in the DB shows up in the queue. But the problem is, any message published to the virtual topic since the restart is lost to that consumer (until it connects next time which creates the queue).

With KahaDB this is not the case. It will correctly show the queue right after the restart with existing messages so any newly published messages will continue coming to the queue.

I'll open a new issue.]
