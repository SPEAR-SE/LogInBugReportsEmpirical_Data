Clearing the subscription from the local map in
DemandForwardingBridgeSupport to make sure that demand can be properly
recreated again.
, [~gtully], Mind taking a look at this to make sure the fix looks good?  It was a simple one line fix in DemandForwardingBridgeSupport and I think it's fine.  I included a test case (NetworkDurableRecreationTest) with 4 tests that all break without this fix, but pass with it.  In the meantime, I'm going to let Jenkins run and see if this change causes other issues., [~cshannon] that looks perfect to me :-), Thanks Gary, if all tests pass I'll backport the fix to 5.12.x as well.]
