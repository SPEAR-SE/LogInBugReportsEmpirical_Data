[so that stack trace indicates that it is waiting for a commit reply from the broker, do you have a corresponding thread dump from the broker to see why that request is blocked?, Thanks Gary- My apology in advance if Iâ€™m asking basic question. 
Is thread dump on AMQ Broker is enabled automatically? 
If yes then which file it will logged. 
If no then what needs to be done to enable thread dumping on AMQ Broker side?

, on unix, 'kill -3' or use jpid, the output appears on the console or with jpid (jdk tool) you have more options. google is your friend here., This issue seems to have same symptoms as mentioned in AMQ-2652, stack trace are same. When I read more on AMQ-2652 it mentioned prefetch extension in AMQ-2651.

Any idea how issue mentioned AMQ 2652 is resolved?
Where and how to set Prefetch Extension if that is the resolution?
