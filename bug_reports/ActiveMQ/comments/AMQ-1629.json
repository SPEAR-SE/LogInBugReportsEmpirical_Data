[I did a little investigation and the problem appears to be here:

DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.java:
    protected boolean isPermissableDestination(ActiveMQDestination destination) {
        // Are we not bridging temp destinations?
        if (destination.isTemporary() && !configuration.isBridgeTempDestinations()) {
            return false;
        }

       A****  DestinationFilter filter = DestinationFilter.parseFilter(destination);
        ActiveMQDestination[] dests = excludedDestinations;
        if (dests != null && dests.length > 0) {
            for (int i = 0; i < dests.length; i++) {
                ActiveMQDestination match = dests[i];
                if (match != null && filter.matches(match)) {
                    return false;
                }
            }
      }

The DestinationFilter returned (A above) is SimpleDestinationFilter because the destination (TEST.FOO) is "simple" ==> filter.matches tries to string comparison eventually( TEST.FOO with TEST.>) and does not match it.
        
 I am not very familiar with the code, but shouldn't  the DestinationFilter reflect wildcard/prefix in either excludedDestination or the queue/topic destination ? 
Thanks

 , I am attaching a  patch that works with  prefixes in the excluded & included destinations. Please review., Patch applied in svn revision 646268, If you have something like this, all messages get excluded; no matter their destination's name.

<excludedDestinations>       
    <queue physicalName="fubar.>"/>     
    <topic physicalName="fubar.>"/>         
</excludedDestinations>     

However, if you change it slightly like this (just took out the 'r' in one of them), then things seem to work.

<excludedDestinations>       
     <queue physicalName="fubar.>"/>     
      <topic physicalName="fuba.>"/>         
</excludedDestinations>     

If there are no dots things seem to also work.
 
Bottom line is that this needs more attention and more thorough testing. , I see two problems with the current implementation (version 5.2)  for excluded- and dynamically-included destinations:

1. The type of the destination (queue, topic) is not distincted:
{code:xml}
<excludedDestinations>  
   <topic physicalName=">"/>  
</excludedDestinations>
{code}
Only topics should be excluded but all queues are also excluded.

2. An entry with a wildcard in the list has a side-effect on the following entries:
{code:xml}
<excludedDestinations>
   <queue physicalName="exclude"/>
</excludedDestinations>
<dynamicallyIncludedDestinations>
   <queue physicalName="foo.>"/>
   <queue physicalName="bar.x"/>
</dynamicallyIncludedDestinations>
{code} 
A message to {{bar.x}} will be blocked because of the wildcard in the first entry.

I've created a test case and a new patch. I would be happy for a review of test case and patch., Fixed by SVN revision 777821]
