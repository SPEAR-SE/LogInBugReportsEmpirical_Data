[Assuming that the source code in the file LDAPLoginModule.java has not changed in the meantime, it looks like this error (on line 134) is caused by a null password. That is, it looks like the client failed to send a password to the broker.

I managed to get LDAP authentication to work, using the instructions from the references you quoted (by the way, thanks for that! I would have been lost without those references). I plan to write this up for the FUSE documentation set in the near future (i.e. the Message Broker Security Guide).

One minor problem with the LDAP authentication plug-in is that it tends to throw a lot of NullPointerExceptions, mainly because it doesn't check all of the login properties for Nullness (nor does it provide default values). Consequently, you have to set some of the login properties to dummy values, even if you don't really need them., Patch for the issue attached.
Added better null checks in LDAPLoginModule. Fixed LDAPLoginModuleTest unit test and updated pom with necessary dependencies for it.

, Modified patch committed in SVN revision 769838. I started working on removing commons-primitives snapshot dependency, which ended up in upgrading to apache ds 1.5.4 and junit 4.4 (see http://directory.apache.org/apacheds/1.5/42-using-apacheds-for-unit-tests.html). Thanks.]
