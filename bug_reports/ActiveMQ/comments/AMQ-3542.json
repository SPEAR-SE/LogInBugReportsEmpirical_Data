{{static:(failover:(a,b)?maxReconnectAttempts=0)}} now works reliably to choose a working url from (a,b) and report failures without trying to reconnect/failover. The network connector then gets to recover using its stop/restart logic.
This is a usage pattern for {{failover:}} where it is used solely to pick a valid broker url. It does *not* try to recover a failed connection. Network connectors need to manage failed connections themselves b/c they are not simple jms client connections.

Note: this commit changes the default value of maxReconnectAttempts for the failover: transport. A value of 0 now disables reconnections, the default for infinite retries is now -1., note: Make sure you do not have randomize=false on your failover uri as I did.  I copied it from a place where that makes sense.  In this situation, it means the {{a}} part of the failover would always be chosen when recovery occurs and it will never fail over.  That was a wasted day.]
