[Searching through the Broker code doesn't reveal any println's that are active so maybe check on your client side. , Well, it's the Broker code which is printing this ID.
, If you can find it, we welcome a patch. , ;-) yeah, I was afraid you'd say that. Let me see if I find the bandwidth to get started on that., Hi Timothy, I tried to get the latest ActiveMQ code through Eclipse/subclipse, but it doesn't let me download it.
The documentation about subversion download says 'site password' - what is that, exactly ?

In my case is it my ActiveMQ User Forum's User name (Axel Podehl) and the user forum's password ? , Not really sure what you are doing, there's no need for a password just to checkout the code from svn, only for commit. , subclipse with https://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/trunk automatically asks me for username and password and none of the combination I could imagine worked.

But from the DOS command line, 'svn co' works, so I'll go that route...

, don't see this anymore with the latest 5.9 snapshot from 20130711
Thanks.]
