[fix in http://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/activemq/commit/ce911baf, Is it possible that we can have a patch for this issue? , I see the same stack trace being output a lot to System.out during our test runs, even though we don't log to System.out and we're already updated to v5.13.0.

Maybe ours aren't spurious but it isn't clear how I am supposed to know.

, We still experience the same with 5.12.1 as well., I have over 600 agents connecting to ActiveMQ broker version 5.13.3. Log is filling up with those error. Any one has solution ?
