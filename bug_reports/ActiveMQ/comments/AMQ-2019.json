[It looks like a socket timeout problem. You can try increasing that time, but generally the better solution is to have a kind of a "keep alive" protocol. It is planed for Stomp v1.1. Until then you can send some dummy messages periodically to keep connection alive. Hope this helps., without keep alive support of stomp, we could send some period msg to simulate keep alive.]
