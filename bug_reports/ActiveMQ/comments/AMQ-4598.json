[Fixed with svn revision 1496430, This fix works, but the queue size hides all the inflight messages because the counter goes immediately to 0, although inflight messages are still being processed.
The behaviour is different when a queue is not purged (all inflight messages are counted in) and when a queue is purged (inflight messages are not counted in).  
This would be more consistent to always reset the counter to the number of inflight messages in the queue (see attachment amq_negative_queue_size_after_purge.diff)
