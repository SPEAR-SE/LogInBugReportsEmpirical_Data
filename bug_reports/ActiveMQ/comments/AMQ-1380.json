[I'm having the same problem.

This patch solve it.

Could you add this issue at 4.1.2 RoadMap. 

Thanks Joe for this patch., This patch is still not part of ActiveMQ 5.0,  where slave file handle leaks are still an issue. I manually applied this patch and it fixed the problem. Why is this patch not part of 5.0? Running a master/slave (persistence based on journal file-system) using a conf file below, leads to the crash of the slave after a few hours, due to running out of open files. If you monitor the number of open files (lsof | wc -l), you'll see that the number of open files keeps increasing every 10 seconds. With this patch, this is no-longer a problem. Please include this patch in the release. Here is the conf file that I've used for master/slave (the only difference is that the value of the IP address in the  broker name and the  transport connector)

</beans>, Why the activeio-core in ActiveMQ lib (activeio-core-3.1-SNAPSHOT.jar) is still labeled as SNAPSHOT? is this a bug in the build label? It is odd to have 5.0 as a released version but it still includes a SNAPSHOT jar. , Patch applied in rev 646352, It does not look like the patch made it into activeio-core-3.1.0 which is included in 5.1.0, hello Friends!

I'd like to know how can I apply that patch? I've tried to find a way, but I can't find out anything. 

can anybody give some help?

Thank you!
, ActiveIO 3.1.2 has just been released with this patch included. It will be included by default in 5.3.0. For earlier versions, download the jar from https://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/releases/org/apache/activemq/activeio-core/3.1.2/ and put it in lib/optional folder.]
