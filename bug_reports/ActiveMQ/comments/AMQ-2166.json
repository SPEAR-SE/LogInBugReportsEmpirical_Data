[Removes the session from the list held by the connection as soon as the session is closed.

I also synchronized access to the session-collection since there might be more than one thread calling #createSession().

Apply to activemq-ra., I modified the synchronization in the patch slightly, applied in rev 813992.  Many thanks for the patch!  Glad to get this into 5.3.]
