[The crash is "java.lang.OutOfMemory" written to the console and further malfunction., I've added a test case to try reproduce it - see CreateLotsOfTemporaryQueuesTest.

You can try it out in the assembly module...

maven test-create-temp-queues -Dcount=30000

Making about 5000 or so seem to run out of heap when using a max heap of 10Mb.
, Note that temporary destinations should always be reused and not created and destroyed in a tight loop; so I've downgraded this to a minor issue.

If you are using temporary destinations for request/response stuff, always use 1 destination & consumer on it, then use a correlationID on the messages rather than creating large numbers of temporary destinations in a tight loop, We have found one or two memory leaks that this test case highlighted. I've just fixed one in DestinationMap which is in 4.0 now - we should have the others licked real soon too..., Fixed the DestinationStatistics memory leak too.  All leaks should now be gone.]
