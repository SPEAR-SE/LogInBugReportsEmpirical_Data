[Database files, I have also experienced this problem, and discovered some other details that might be useful:

- After getting a stack trace like the above once, if you try to start ActiveMQ again, it works.  I haven't figured out yet if anything is lost from the DB.

- If you try to do graceful shutdown of a machine with ActiveMQ/KahaDB running, you can't.  The message "mount: / is busy" appears, and an ungraceful shutdown is needed if ActiveMQ isn't stopped first., I had the same problem in production.

During the shutdown process RedHat does not execute the shutdown init script under /etc/init.d/yourservice if you don't have a corresponding file under /var/lock/subsys/yourservice. This causes the KahaDB file corruption.

Personally I think that Redhat is wrong in requiring the /var/lock/subsys stuff (documented here: http://www.redhat.com/magazine/008jun05/departments/tips_tricks/ "Why do init scripts require lock files?"). And I think that KahaDB does wrong corrupting its file if the process get ungraciously killed by a server shutdown, since the meaning of using it is to recover from failures (ie. a server crash, which won't do a clean shutdown).

Regards,

Luigi, With the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3422 a failure to recover the producerAudit does not cause startup to fail., The description makes it appear unrelated but the fix for https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3422 included traping errors relating to the recovery of the producer audit. Which is the problem here.]
