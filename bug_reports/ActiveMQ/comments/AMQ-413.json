[BTW you can use

broker:foo.xml 

to refer to some XML file on the classpath or

broker:file:foo/bar/whatnot.xml

to refer to an XML file on the file system. Would that help?

Having the default config stuff on the classpath seems a good idea to simplify the command line (e.g. if you wish to run it from where the logs should go or something).

If you want to specify another file you could always use a different filename?, I think this is fixed now right? Let  us know if not and we can reopen]
