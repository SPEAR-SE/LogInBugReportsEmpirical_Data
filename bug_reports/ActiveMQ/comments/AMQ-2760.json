[I could reproduce this issue with 
ActiveMQ 5.3.1 (default config)
1 TopicPublisher
1 MessageListener

indeed the TotalQueueCounter does not increase, although the messages are delivered to the client.
*However, it does work if you don't use wildcat subscriptions (i.e. FOO.>)*


, JConsole screenshots showing Total DequeueCounter not increasing although the subscription counter does., Please provide a unit test that demonstrates the issue.  Unable to reproduce using the info given., Are you using durable subscription?]
