[could you provide a test case ?, There are about 30 parties doing concurrent request / response messaging for about 20 minutes. At the end I stop AMQ and I get that error on restart. You just need to do more concurrent testing. It does not happen if I configure Journal JDBC with Derby. I am sorry I cannot write unit test at the moment., I have run into a similar issue where AMQ gets hung on restart.  In my case, the KahaStore is stuck in an infinite loop because it finds two IndexItem objects from the file that point to each other.  It's a potential show stopper because there is no way to recover the data in the queue.

Here's a dump of the object variables from Eclipse:

item	IndexItem  (id=212)	

	active	false	

	keyFile	1	

	keyOffset	153495	

	keySize	61	

	next	null	

	nextItem	612	

	offset	765	

	prev	null	

	previousItem	51	

	valueFile	1	

	valueOffset	153561	

	valueSize	468	



item	IndexItem  (id=240)	

	active	false	

	keyFile	1	

	keyOffset	114687	

	keySize	61	

	next	null	

	nextItem	765	

	offset	612	

	prev	null	

	previousItem	51	

	valueFile	1	

	valueOffset	114753	

	valueSize	468
