[Seems for excludedDestinations, there are no cases where the method resolution order causes anything to fail.. but it's just waiting to happen.

However, not only excludedDestination is duplicated in the class hierarchy. So are dynamicallyIncludedDestinations and staticallyIncludedDestinations. DynamicallyIncludedDestinations being repeated *DOES* cause a bug. I will write a test case for that (in the process). 

I will remove this duplication as it's just waiting for more bugs., BTW... huge thanks to those that wrote DuplexNetworkTest... caught this :), Fixed in r1418373]
