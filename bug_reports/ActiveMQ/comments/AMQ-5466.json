[Would advise testing against a 5.11-SNAPSHOT if you still have an issue then a test case that shows the issue would be needed., I downloaded http://repository.apache.org/content/repositories/snapshots/org/apache/activemq/apache-activemq/5.11-SNAPSHOT/apache-activemq-5.11-20141130.222719-162-bin.tar.gz , but I doesn't start service. data/activemq.log is empty, there is no changes in config files., Reason of the problem is that MQTT connector for ActiveMQ doesn't look at QoS flag for subscription. It contains the code below

        QoS qoS;
        if (message.propertyExists(QOS_PROPERTY_NAME)) {
            int ordinal = message.getIntProperty(QOS_PROPERTY_NAME);
            qoS = QoS.values()[ordinal];

        } else {
            qoS = message.isPersistent() ? QoS.AT_MOST_ONCE : QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE;
        }

So, to solve the problem is enough to set QoS for each message. If you use NMS:

For ActiveMQ 5.10

    msg.Properties.SetInt("ActiveMQ.MQTT.QoS", 2);

For ActiveMQ 5.9

     msg.Properties.SetInt("QoSPropertyName", 2);

I'm not sure, that it's expected behavior - ignore QoS of subscription.]
