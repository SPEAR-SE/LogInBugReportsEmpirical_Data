[Thread states from the broker when the issue happens, Thread states from the application during the issue., Just want to add that I used two machines to reproduce this on a non-prod environment, one for the broker and one for the app. JMeter was run on a different machine, to send load to the application which acted like a producer as well as consumer ... all part of the same war file, implemented using Spring.
, No test case to validate against a current broker.]
