[Good news, the Scenario #4 has been succeeded in Domain Log as well, now restarting the AS will automatically reconnect the store-forward AMQ with remote MS (s). I guess the reason is the store-forward broker (on MS) should disable the JMX or must guarantee the JMX is started correctly if JMX enabled. In previous failure of reconnection, the JMX of managed broker is not started successfully; but when I disable JMX on the broker (broker.setUseJmx(false)), the Scenario is okay!


but it is still an issue that the client (store-forward) AMQ can not stop when the server AMQ is closed., The 4.x broker line is EOL]
