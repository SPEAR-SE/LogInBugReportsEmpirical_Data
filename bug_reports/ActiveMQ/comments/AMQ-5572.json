[ByteMessage formatted messages were received from examples/websocket/index.html over websocket-stomp protocol 
and the  examples/stomp/cpp/listener is only expecting TextMessage.

After changing example to handle ByteMessage this works ,
Maybe the cpp examples can be modified in future releases to avoid newbie issues like these.]
