[You'll need to provide a unit test that can reproduce the issue in order for any investigation, Thanks for the hint We will provide it as soon as we manage to reproduce it properly. Unfortunately, we are not able of reproducing it at will. We have an angular app that connects via wss to the ActiveMQ, and sometimes clients disconnect, meaning the browser is closed, the connection is  closed in the server according to netstat, but ActiveMQ shows it as connected. 

We tried different scenarios to investigate what could be going on (closing normally, unplugging the cable, hibernating the machine...). In all of them, the socket is properly closed and ActiveMQ does not show the connection anymore. However, from time to time (matter of days/weeks) this happens. The only solution is restarting the server.

Is there something that we can check when it happens again? Is there a way of closing these connections manually?, No reproducer provided, not enough information to investigate , Just for the record, the issue disappeared so far with version 5.15.0. We could not find a way to reproduce it as it was happening randomly, but we have been two weeks now without the problem.]
