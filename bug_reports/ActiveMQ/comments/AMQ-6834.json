[[~davsclaus] or [~chris@die-schneider.net] - Can we just delete this line or do we need to update it to http\://camel.apache.org/schema/blueprint=org.apache.camel.blueprint.CamelNamespaceHandler, Yeah not sure why those camel namespace handlers are there, I would assume you can remove all of them, so its only ActiveMQ left., Commit b27b4d9a3338945125cc64ead87ea65fba785fd5 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.15.x from [~davsclaus]

AMQ-6834: activemq-osgi should not include camel namespace in spring as they have been removed from Camel. Only blueprint is supported
, [~davsclaus] - Don't we still want to keep the camel-spring stuff and only remove the osgi line?  I think it was only this line that was broken http\://camel.apache.org/schema/osgi=org.apache.camel.osgi.CamelNamespaceHandler

I think we still need to keep http\://camel.apache.org/schema/spring/camel-spring.xsd=camel-spring.xsd

There's a bunch of tests that refer to that schema and there is now a test failure because of the schema being removed:  https://builds.apache.org/view/A/view/ActiveMQ/job/ActiveMQ-Java8/lastBuild/org.apache.activemq$activemq-karaf-itest/testReport/org.apache.activemq.karaf.itest/ActiveMQBrokerNdCamelFeatureTest/test/, You are welcome to add it back and see if that helps, Commit 0c396a23e761c9371edacbdbddff891fcc0e3a04 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]

AMQ-6834 - Adding back in spring schemas for camel

(cherry picked from commit 0c396a23e761c9371edacbdbddff891fcc0e3a04)
, Ok I partially reverted your commit, I added back in the spring schema but I left out the osgi one that was broken.  I think this will sort it but we can wait for CI to confirm.]
