[Any chance you could take a look at this?, Can you attach the error message please.  Just downloaded the 4.1.1 source tar.gz from the activemq site and it seems to work fine when I build it.
Btw, make sure  to do the maven build inside the src\   directory, It seems to be there now.  Sorry., No worries David - gonna mark this one as resolved]
