[Since we are stuck using the old code from the service wrapper there's not much we can do.  The Windows 64 version of the service wrapper is not available in the community edition.  , I added a note about the 4gb limit on windows

https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/Java+Service+Wrapper, Hi Claus,

The original issue I raised was that we couldn't address more than 4GB of memory when using the 64-bit Linux wrapper, so at the very least, it would be worth putting the same note about the memory limit under the Linux wrapper section of the page you updated.

However, I guess I'm more interested in whether this will ever be fixed, or whether we will have to look at other queues in order to be able to address more than 4GB memory?

Thanks,

Paul, You need to buy a license for the wrapper if you want to use it with Windows. Or upgrade to newer release of wrapper yourself, as we cannot distribute a newer release because they changed the license terms, so ASF does not allow included that in their releases.

, I'm not sure how I can make this any clearer - I'm not interested in running this on Windows!

The ticket I've raised specifically refers to the 64-bit wrapper on Linux. Can you please comment on whether the linux 64-bit wrapper will be fixed to support more than 4GB of RAM, or whether we will need to look for a paid version/alternative queue service?

Thanks,

Paul, Update the wiki page with better warning]
