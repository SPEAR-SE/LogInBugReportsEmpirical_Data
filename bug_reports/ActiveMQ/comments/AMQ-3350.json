[A fix that is working for me is to change the {{sendPoll();}} call in {{initHandler()}} to {{pollHandler(data);}}

My method now looks like this and it is working as expected:
{code:title=amq.js|borderStyle=solid}
	var initHandler = function(data) {
		sessionInitialized = true;
		if(sessionInitializedCallback) {
			sessionInitializedCallback();
		}
		//sendPoll();
		pollHandler(data);
	}

{code} , This is for the web-demo's, Thanks for the patch.]
