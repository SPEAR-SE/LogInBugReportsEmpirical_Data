[What do you mean by stopping requests?  Do you mean closing the web socket connection is what causes the error? , Mhh no, by "but basically it seems that stoping wss requests stop this" I mean that if I block wss port in firewall, so that no connections happen, then the NPE dissapear, so it's likely that this NPE is caused by wss (we also use stomp, hence this precision).

We've not identified when this issue occurs, and were not able to reproduce it by ourself (we have quiet a lot of traffic). However, it keeps happening quiet often (~ 1 per second).
I'm available on IRC (Sp4rKy) if you want some more live debugging., Closing as a duplicate because AMQ-6491 better describes the root cause of the issue.]
