[Test code (client calling a remote session bean):

public class Test {

   public static void main(String arg[]) throws NamingException {
      Hashtable<String, String> props = new Hashtable<String, String>();

      props.put("java.naming.factory.initial", "org.jnp.interfaces.NamingContextFactory");
      props.put("java.naming.factory.url.pkgs","org.jboss.naming:org.jnp.interfaces");
      props.put("java.naming.provider.url","localhost:1099");
      InitialContext context = new InitialContext(props);
      HelloRemote remote = (HelloRemote) context.lookup("/rar_performance/HelloBean/remote");

      remote.helloWorld();
   }
}, with the vanilla 5.3.1 rar, this works fine for me. The rar connection factory is enlisted in the XA transaction. It must be the mods to the rar to support the transaction recovery processing that is problematic., Yes, it looks like I was too focused on getting the integration with the recovery manager working.
We should probably remove those changes and find another way to get that part working., https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2670 sorts this issue out. Please reopen if this is not the case.]
