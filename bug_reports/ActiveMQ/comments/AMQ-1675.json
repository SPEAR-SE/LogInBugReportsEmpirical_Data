[Hi 

Joseph when you attached the patch you did not click on the option that states you grant the ASF a ASL 2.0 license on your patch.  We can't commit this change until you re-attach and click that option., since the patch was not given under ASL 2.0 terms we can't merge it in.  Please re-open if you change your mind.]
