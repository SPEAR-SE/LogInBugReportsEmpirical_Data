[Questions should be sent to the users mailing list.  If a bug is confirmed then open a Jira, you probably won't get questions answered in a Jira., I am reopening the issue.

The bug/defect in Active MQ is the fact that message order is not preserved across multiple concurrent consumers. 

Message group merely provides a way to route/group certain messages to a single consumer. But doesn't support concurrent consumers consuming messages that have same group id., This is not a bug.  Electing to use message groups is an explicit choice to give up in-order dispatch for messages that are in the group compared with messages that are either not in a group at all or are in another group.

Dispatch will be in-order for all messages within a single group (or for messages that have no group), but there are no mechanisms provided or implied for delaying dispatch/consumption of messages that are not in a given group because an earlier message that's in the group has not yet been dispatched/consumed.

Recommending re-closing.  Abhinav, leave it closed this time around.]
