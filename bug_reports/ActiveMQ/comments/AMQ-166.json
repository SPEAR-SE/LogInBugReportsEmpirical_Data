[The receipt handling in TransportChannelSupport uses a ConcurrentHashMap and so is thread safe.

To answer your question we have a StatsCapable interface...

http://activemq.codehaus.org/maven/apidocs/org/codehaus/activemq/management/StatsCapable.html

which all of the core JMS objects implement (factory, connection, session, consumer, producer, destination) which allows you to access the available statistics.

To look at queue depths, you need to use the broker side management stats; which are a little rough and ready right now - we'll be improving those shortly]
