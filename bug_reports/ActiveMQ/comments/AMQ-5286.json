, A quick fix for this is to replace "http://" in the following with "//", or even just remove http://activemq.apache.org from the tags:

    <link href="http://activemq.apache.org/styles/site.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
    <link href="http://activemq.apache.org/styles/type-settings.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
    <script src="http://activemq.apache.org/styles/prototype.js" type="text/javascript"></script>
    <script src="http://activemq.apache.org/styles/rico.js" type="text/javascript"></script>    
    <script src="http://activemq.apache.org/styles/site.js" type="text/javascript"></script>]
