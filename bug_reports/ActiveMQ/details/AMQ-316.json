While in my present configuration I can interconnect all brokers and it is not a problem.  I might even be a good thing as it keeps network traffic down.  But I can imagine scenarios where this would be a problem.\n\nSo again I ask: Is this was a design feature or a bug?\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2005-09-02T19:27:26.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-02T19:27:26.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481388/comment/12936608","id":"12936608","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This is partly a design decision; we made sure store and forward worked first.

First the activemq.dtd was not updated when the change to NetworkChannel.java was checked in.  After making the update I tried to set the value to false, but did not seem to have any effect.  The broker configuration was setup as follows\n\nA <> B <> C\n\nThe producing client was attached to broker A. The consuming client attached to broker C.  Neither value for demandBasedForwarding will allow the produced message to travel across both bridges (A-B and B-C) to arrive at the consumer.  I have confirmed this both with non-persistent Topic and persistent queue messages.  In addition, with the value set to false, I expected to see the produced message for a non-persistent Topic message to atleast travel across the first bridge (A-B) even if there was no client for the message on broker B.  But no message is passed in this case.\n\nSo one more time I ask, is it valid to have a configuration such as show here:\n\nProducing client  > broker A <> broker B <> broker C > consuming client\n\nIf so, then this is still broken.\n\n\nNote, the attachment includes my broker configuration files in addition to scripts libraries and classes that I used for testing.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2005-09-06T19:22:33.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-06T19:22:33.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481388/comment/12937343","id":"12937343","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aco","name":"aco","key":"aco","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adrian Co","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"- Added org.apache.activemq.usecases.TwoBrokerMessageNotSentToRemoteWhenNoConsumerTest to check that no message dispatches are sent over the network when there is no consumer registered at the remote broker.\n\n- Added org.apache.activemq.usecases.ThreeBrokerQueueNetworkTest.test_AB_BC_BrokerNetwork to test a three broker setup producer->BrokerA->BrokerB->BrokerC->consumer.
