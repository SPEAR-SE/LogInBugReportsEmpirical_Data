These delivery acks are consolidated by calling ackLater which batches them up using first/last message id and sends the acks as appropriate w.r.t. the prefetch size.\n* On the broker, the prefetch window is extended by checking the last message id, finding where it is in the dispatched queue and incrementing the prefetchExtension accordingly.  This algorithm depends on the consumer maintaining the dispatch order in its consolidated delivery acks.\n* When the transacted redelivery occurs, it happens in a separate thread than the receive, operating on the latest delivered message.  The delivery acks from the receive thread are arbitrarily delayed (but in order of dispatch) depending on client action.  The mixing of these can result in an out of order consolidated delivery ack.\n\nReal example (the client and broker logs are mixed to make it easier to follow; the dispatch logs come from my own custom logging plugin):\n{noformat}\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,712 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [BrokerService[jmsBroker] Task-3] - Dispatching message [ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:1]\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,834 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [BrokerService[jmsBroker] Task-43] - Dispatching message [ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1:3]\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,835 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [BrokerService[jmsBroker] Task-43] - Dispatching message [ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:2]\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,836 DA [ActiveMQ Session Task-1] - ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:33:1:1 tracking transacted redelivery of duplicate: ActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 827, responseRequired = true, messageId = ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:2, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1, destination = queue://indexer.index-content-dispatcher, transactionId = null, expiration = 0, timestamp = 1318434696398, arrival = 0, brokerInTime = 1318434696461, brokerOutTime = 1318434711835, correlationId = null, replyTo = null, persistent = true, type = null, priority = 4, groupID = null, groupSequence = 0, targetConsumerId = null, compressed = false, userID = null, content = null, marshalledProperties = org.apache.activemq.util.ByteSequence@305e3ad0, dataStructure = null, redeliveryCounter = 0, size = 0, properties = XXX }\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,876 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///127.0.0.1:55235] - firstId: ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:2, lastId: ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:1, dest: queue://indexer.index-content-dispatcher, acktype:0, individualAck:false, deliveredAck:true, messageAck:true, standardAck:false\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,878 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [BrokerService[jmsBroker] Task-8] - Dispatching message [ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1:4]\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,879 DA [ActiveMQ Session Task-1] - ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:33:1:1 tracking transacted redelivery of duplicate: ActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 840, responseRequired = true, messageId = ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1:4, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1, destination = queue://indexer.index-content-dispatcher, transactionId = null, expiration = 0, timestamp = 1318434696518, arrival = 0, brokerInTime = 1318434696600, brokerOutTime = 1318434711878, correlationId = null, replyTo = null, persistent = true, type = null, priority = 4, groupID = null, groupSequence = 0, targetConsumerId = null, compressed = false, userID = null, content = null, marshalledProperties = org.apache.activemq.util.ByteSequence@332a4674, dataStructure = null, redeliveryCounter = 0, size = 0, properties = XXX }\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,903 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///127.0.0.1:55235] - firstId: ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1:4, lastId: ID:XXX-60241-1318434687532-0:56:1:1:3, dest: queue://indexer.index-content-dispatcher, acktype:0, individualAck:false, deliveredAck:true, messageAck:true, standardAck:false\n\n2011-10-12 11:51:51,905 TRACE ActiveMqBroker [BrokerService[jmsBroker] Task-8] - Dispatching message [ID:XXX-45585-1318434687322-0:68:1:1:3]\n\n{noformat}\n\nIn the first ack received by the broker, you can see that message {{68:1:1:2}} is the first id and {{68:1:1:1}} is the last id.  The broker never looks at the first id and will consider this a delivery ack of everything up to {{68:1:1:1}} (which was the first message dispatched).  Thus this mixing results in a incorrect delivery count on the part of the broker.\n\nAn easy fix which would sometimes prematurely extend the prefetch window would be to always send transacted redelivery acks immediately (or consolidate them separately from receive originated delivery acks).  Since transacted redelivery acks always get triggered on messages delivered later than the receive acks this would cause the broker to think that all the earlier messages had been delivered also.  This might be inappropriate with really large prefetch sizes, although this is tempered by the fact that this only occurs in failover situations.  \n\nAnother fix might be to enqueue the transacted redelivered messages and do the filtering of these types of messages in the dequeue method which would result in proper ordering of the delivery acks.\n\nAnything else would seem to require explicit broker accounting of each delivered message.
