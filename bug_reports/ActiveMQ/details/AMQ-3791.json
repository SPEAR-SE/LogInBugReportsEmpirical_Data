This case sensitivity leads to issues with AD.\n3) For synchronous updates to the AuthZ policy, the temp destination policy is not reset and may retain out-of-date policy entries.\n\n1) Requires examining the usage of these structures and applying the necessary protections.\n2) Can be resolved with better String parsing or through applying the changes in AMQ-3770 to CachedLDAPAuthorizationMap as well.\n3) Can be resolved by clearing the policy entry before repopulating the policy from LDAP.\n\n\nThere are also several enhancements to the configurability of the implementation that I see:\n\n1) Support user or group membership in the LDAP entry representing a permission on a destination.  Allowing user DNs or group DNs here makes it easier to deal with one-off policies for individual users.\n2) Group membership in the LDAP entry representing a permission on a destination should support use of the full DN, not just the value of the member CN.\n3) The based DN should be fully customizable and the LDAP entry representing a permission on a destination should support use of an optional prefix for uniqueness.  \"cn=<PREFIX>read,ou=$,...\"\n4) The name of the GroupPrincipal or UserPrincipal that is created from the policy in LDAP should be flexible.  For instance, allow the group name or user name attribute to be configured.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12522864","id":"12522864","filename":"AMQ-3791.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davaleri","name":"davaleri","key":"davaleri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Valeri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-04-16T21:28:47.905+0000","size":165650,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12522864/AMQ-3791.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"59183","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Flexibility, concurrency, security, and compatibility issues in CachedLDAPAuthorizationMap","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davaleri","name":"davaleri","key":"davaleri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Valeri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davaleri","name":"davaleri","key":"davaleri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Valeri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548676/comment/13241257","id":"13241257","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davaleri","name":"davaleri","key":"davaleri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Valeri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I am working on a patch to this issue that would be backwards compatible with the existing CachedLDAPAuthorizationMap in the trunk;

These tests are @Ignore at the moment since they require an external LDAP server; however they make gooe examples and are useful for ensuring compatibility in the future.\n8) Compatibility with what I am calling \"legacy group mapping\" where the permission group members are simply a CN and not a full DN.\n9) Supports sub-tree renames at the destination pattern level if the LDAP server supports them.\n\nWhat you lose:\n\n1) Push updates against ApacheDS 1.x.  At the moment Apache DS 1.x push updates don't support filters or scope properly.  As such, the push update solution that avoids parsing DNs doesn't work against Apache DS 1.x.  I can revert to using DN parsing for supporting ApacheDS 1.x; however, I will parse them using LdapName and not raw String manipulation.\n\n\n\nFeedback welcome.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davaleri","name":"davaleri","key":"davaleri","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Valeri","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2012-04-16T21:39:24.150+0000","updated":"2012-04-16T21:41:25.191+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548676/comment/13283790","id":"13283790","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"This new patch should look to ensure it resolves this issue as well.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2012-05-25T22:33:48.669+0000","updated":"2012-05-25T22:33:48.669+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12548676/comment/13290953","id":"13290953","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Patch applied with svn revision 1347580.
