For this to work, I modified the ProducerTool to use username/password as follows:\n\n    private String user = \"system\";\n    private String password = \"manager\";\n\nI then connected to the broker using jconsole, and created a new queue using the Broker's addQueue MBean operation.  As a test, I also used the TEST.FOO queue's removeMessage MBean operation to remove a message from the queue.\n\nThe problem is that certain MBean operations fail with \"Problem invoking moveMessageTo : java.lang.SecurityException: User is not authenticated.\"  I have seen this with a queue's sendTextMessage and moveMessageTo operations.\n\nThe full exception as logged by the broker for the failed sendTextMessage operation is:\n\n WARN | Failed to add Connection\njava.lang.SecurityException: User name or password is invalid.\n\tat org.apache.activemq.security.SimpleAuthenticationBroker.addConnection(SimpleAuthenticationBroker.java:52)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.BrokerFilter.addConnection(BrokerFilter.java:82)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.MutableBrokerFilter.addConnection(MutableBrokerFilter.java:89)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnection.processAddConnection(TransportConnection.java:666)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.command.ConnectionInfo.visit(ConnectionInfo.java:134)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnection.service(TransportConnection.java:297)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnection$1.onCommand(TransportConnection.java:175)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.ResponseCorrelator.onCommand(ResponseCorrelator.java:109)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportFilter.onCommand(TransportFilter.java:68)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.vm.VMTransport.iterate(VMTransport.java:205)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.thread.DedicatedTaskRunner.runTask(DedicatedTaskRunner.java:98)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.thread.DedicatedTaskRunner$1.run(DedicatedTaskRunner.java:36)\n\n\nThis seems similar to AMQ-2516.
