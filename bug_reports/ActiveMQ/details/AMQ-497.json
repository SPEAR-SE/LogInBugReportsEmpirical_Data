Otherwise there is no way for that thread to come back to life. The client does produce an async exception alert... However that is not sufficient. That handles any of your async consumers. This is a sync consumer, it's blocked until it returns, or fails. Your async exception routine should wake up all sync consumers with an exception on their receive() call. The user cannot do this, because even if he could somehow find which Thread is blocked, interrupting the thread is not guaranteed to work. Most JMS providers throw an exception. 3.2.1 threw an exception. Perhaps if I wrote an async exception trigger to close the Sender, it would unblock the other thread.. However the receieve should really throw an exception.
