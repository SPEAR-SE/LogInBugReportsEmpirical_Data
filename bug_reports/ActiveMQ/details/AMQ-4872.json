At about the 60 hour point, the high-priority client (using spring jmsTemplate) lost it's connection to the ActiveMQ server, reporting a jms ConnectionFailedException. On the server side, ActiveMQ logged the following for each attempt to connect by the client:\n\nbq. 2013-11-11 11:50:12,667 [127.0.0.1:48682] INFO  Transport                      - Transport failed: java.io.EOFException\n\nIn addition, accessing the queues in the web administrative interface shows a list of 'garbage' entries that includes the list of files that appear to be from a cgi directory, but includes .asp files that one wouldn't find on a Linux host.\n\nRunning 'service activemq status' reports activemq as being up.
