Occasionally however, we will have other clients connect from other PCs on the network, running identical code.\n\nAfter some arbitrary time however, new nonlocal clients that connect are unable to receive updates to the topic.  New local clients, however, have no problem.\n\nFor the nonlocal clients, there are no error messages and the broker registers the connection and disconnection of the client.  Just no data streaming through.\n\nThe only thing that seems to resolve the issue is restarting both the broker machine and the client machine which is somewhat problematic.\n\nI wish I had better details to pinpoint this bug (or idiosyncratic network issue) but the absence of dataflow is tricky to lock down.
