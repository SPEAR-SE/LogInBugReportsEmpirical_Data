If a ConnectionConsumer is blocked, it cannot deliver new messages\n\tuntil a ServerSession is eventually returned.\n{quote}\n\\\\\nI am using a 3rd-party JMS Resource Adapter to integrate ActiveMQ with a J2EE app server.  This Resource Adapter does just what the JMS Spec above allows - it blocks in the ServerSessionPool.getServerSession() call when it is out of ServerSessions.  This causes ActiveMQ to hang due to a deadlock.\n\nThe deadlock occurs because the ServerSessionPool uses a single connection to service all its ServerSessions.  This is perfectly legal.  However, ActiveMQ is using this same connection for both dispatching messages to the ConnectionConsumer as well as communicating transaction commits to the JMS engine.  \n\nSo the deadlock scenario is as follows:\n\\- message 1 is dispatched to the ConnectionConsumer and is being processed\n\\- before message 1 is committed, message 2 is dispatched\n\\- ServerSession is requested for processing message 2\n\\- ServerSessionPool.getServerSession() blocks because it is out of ServerSessions, blocking the connection from which the call was made\n\\- message 1 is finished processing and the tx is committed\n\\- ActiveMQ does a synchronous send using the same connection that is currently blocked, to communicate the transaction commit command\n\\- the commit blocks waiting for the connection to be released which will never happen because that release is dependent on the ServerSession being returned to the pool which won't happen until the tx is committed\n\nThe stacktraces of the 2 deadlocked threads at the time of the deadlock are as follows:\n\n{noformat} \n\"ActiveMQ Transport: tcp://localhost/127.0.0.1:61616\" prio=6 tid=0x0aecc9f8 nid=0x1414 in Object.wait() [0x0b6af000..0x0b6afc68]\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait(Native Method)\n\t- waiting on <0x03070188> (a org.apache.activemq.BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest$TestServerSessionPool)\n\tat java.lang.Object.wait(Object.java:474)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest$TestServerSessionPool.getServerSession(BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest.java:106)\n\t- locked <0x03070188> (a org.apache.activemq.BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest$TestServerSessionPool)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionConsumer.dispatch(ActiveMQConnectionConsumer.java:129)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection$2.processMessageDispatch(ActiveMQConnection.java:1676)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.command.MessageDispatch.visit(MessageDispatch.java:108)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection.onCommand(ActiveMQConnection.java:1658)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.ResponseCorrelator.onCommand(ResponseCorrelator.java:109)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportFilter.onCommand(TransportFilter.java:68)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.WireFormatNegotiator.onCommand(WireFormatNegotiator.java:113)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.InactivityMonitor.onCommand(InactivityMonitor.java:210)\n\t- locked <0x03064e98> (a org.apache.activemq.transport.InactivityMonitor$1)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.TransportSupport.doConsume(TransportSupport.java:84)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransport.doRun(TcpTransport.java:203)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransport.run(TcpTransport.java:185)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:595)\n\t\n\n\"Thread-5\" prio=6 tid=0x0af48ae0 nid=0x14a4 waiting on condition [0x0b8af000..0x0b8afbe8]\n\tat sun.misc.Unsafe.park(Native Method)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport.park(LockSupport.java:118)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer$ConditionObject.await(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.java:1841)\n\tat java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue.take(ArrayBlockingQueue.java:341)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.FutureResponse.getResult(FutureResponse.java:40)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.ResponseCorrelator.request(ResponseCorrelator.java:80)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection.syncSendPacket(ActiveMQConnection.java:1244)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.TransactionContext.syncSendPacketWithInterruptionHandling(TransactionContext.java:643)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.TransactionContext.commit(TransactionContext.java:286)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession.commit(ActiveMQSession.java:510)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest$TestServerSession$1.run(BlockingServerSessionPoolDeadlockTest.java:140)\n{noformat} \n\n\\\\\nI'm attaching a junit test that illustrates this deadlock.\n\nNow, I realize that this bug does not manifest itself if the ActiveMQ Resource Adapter is used.  However, that is only because of the way AMQ RA works - it reuses existing ServerSessions instead of blocking when it runs out (and does a weird callback from the jms session to the ServerSession to start a tx, in order to avoid delivering several messages on same tx which is what would happen when reusing an existing ServerSession that is already in the middle of processing another message).  \n\nI think this is a bug in AMQ JMS engine's implementation which just happens to be masked by the way AMQ RA is implemented.  If a Resource Adapted relies on the blocking behavior clearly provisioned by the JMS Spec, the problem becomes evident.
