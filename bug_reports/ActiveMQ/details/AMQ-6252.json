We were monitoring our broker via jmx using the CurrentState attribute for a year or so now and i only just realized that the value is useless.  The value is useless because _it is only updated if you call the healthList() method first_.  The CurrentState attribute is the one someone would most likely monitor using an external automated management product, yet it is not useful by itself.  I would recommend one of the following approaches:\n* at the very least, the current behavior should be _clearly documented_ so that users know they have to call one of the other methods first in order to get a valid CurrentState\n* Alternately, it would be nice if calling the getCurrentState() by itself were sufficient.  this could be accomplished via one of the following approaches:\n** Have the BrokerService schedule a periodic task to invoke the healthList() method in order to ensure that the CurrentState attribute gets updated.\n** Track a \"last updated\" field within the HealthView class and have the getCurrentState() method itself invoke the healthList() method first if the currentState is too old.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HealthView has a variety of weaknesses","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jahlborn","name":"jahlborn","key":"jahlborn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jahlborn","name":"jahlborn","key":"jahlborn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12958905/comment/15241837","id":"15241837","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Since the Broker doesn't know if anyone is even looking at the HealthView bits it wouldn't be optimal to be doing such a heavyweight operation for no good reason which is why there isn't a scheduled task.
