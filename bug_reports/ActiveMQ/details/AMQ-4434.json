First server became master worked for a while and went down, then second server (the one with little disk space left) became a master and worked for a while, than it became unresponsive and all AcitveMQ cluster was unaccessible. \nI belive it's due the fact that on the box with little space ActiveMQ was still running and perhaps preventing DB connection to be release for other servers to use.  \n\nSuggestion: check disk space on start and periodically after start, once disk space is low on none left - gracefully exit.\n\nRegards.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"321434","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"AcitveMQ stop responding when OS running out of free disk space","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andriykalashnykov","name":"andriykalashnykov","key":"andriykalashnykov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andriy Kalashnykov","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andriykalashnykov","name":"andriykalashnykov","key":"andriykalashnykov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andriy Kalashnykov","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"RHEL 6.4 x64 bit","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12640630/comment/13808939","id":"13808939","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davsclaus","name":"davsclaus","key":"davsclaus","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835"},"displayName":"Claus Ibsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"There is some disk space left check in AMQ 5.9 on startup.
