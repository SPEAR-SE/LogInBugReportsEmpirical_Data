To make it a short story, some transitive dependencies of the 5.6.0 activemq-core were including the servlet-api (and thus were part of the bundle) which explains why the bundle plugin wasn't adding the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http packages.\n\nIn the activemq-web-console's pom.xml file, you see the following:\n\n{quote}\n            <Embed-Dependency>*;scope=compile|runtime</Embed-Dependency>\n            <Embed-Transitive>true</Embed-Transitive>\n{quote}\n\nAnd if you follow the dependency tree for \n\n{quote}\n    <dependency>\n      <groupId>${project.groupId}</groupId>\n      <artifactId>activemq-core</artifactId>\n    </dependency>\n{quote}\n\nyou'll see the two instances of the servlet spec within the transitive deps:\n\n{quote}\nmvn dependency:tree | grep servlet\n{quote}\n\nYou'll see that although the geronimo servlet spec has \"provided\" scope, the other two (transitives from fusemq-leveldb->hadoop-core) have \"compile\" scope and will be included in the WEB-INF/lib directory of the bundle. Thus when bnd tries to determine whether to add the appropriate packages, it decides not to since they're already on the class path.\n\nThere are two options to fix:\n1) add the javax.servlet and javax.servlet.http to the <Import-Package> instructions to the bundle plugin. This just kinda glosses over the fact that the servlet api is being included\nor\n2) exclude the servlet api from the activemq-core transitive dependencies.\n\nI would suggest the second approach. I've added this patch.\nLet me know if I didn't explain something clear.\nChristian\n\n\nPatch is attached.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ceposta","name":"ceposta","key":"ceposta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051"},"displayName":"Christian Posta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2012-05-23T00:38:28.176+0000","updated":"2012-05-23T00:38:28.176+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12556621/comment/13281488","id":"13281488","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks Christian, great work.
