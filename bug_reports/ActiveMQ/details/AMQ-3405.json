The consumer once again fails to consume the message greater than the max number of times.\n4. The message is not put back into the DLQ. If it was moved rather than copied, it means we have a message that was never successfully consumed, but has nevertheless disappeared.\n\nThis is all with the default ActiveMQ settings, though I tried adjusted the DLQ configuration to support both expired and non-persistent messages.\n\nI found this posting which seems to indicate the same issue I am seeing: http://www.mail-archive.com/users@activemq.apache.org/msg09683.html. One difference that I am seeing is that restarting ActiveMQ does not cause the message to show up in the DLQ again. Once it is lost, it is lost forever.\n\nTo replicate this, I believe you can use a consumer that just fails on every invocation.\n\nOne interesting thing is that if I put a message into the DLQ directly, then move it to a queue with a consumer, it will end up in the DLQ again as you would expect. If I then move the DLQ message back to the original queue, it will then show the bevahiour outlined above.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"166422","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DLQ messages moved/copied into original queue disappear after failing processing for a second time","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=carfey","name":"carfey","key":"carfey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carey Flichel","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=carfey","name":"carfey","key":"carfey","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Carey Flichel","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows 7, Java 64bit 1.6 update 20, Client and server 5.4.2","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514497/comment/13067262","id":"13067262","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"It would be really helpful if you could take a stab at creating a JUnit test to reproduce the issue, this will also ensure that if it gets fixed it won't break again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2011-07-18T20:05:03.505+0000","updated":"2011-07-18T20:05:03.505+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12514497/comment/13076087","id":"13076087","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sbrandwoo","name":"sbrandwoo","key":"sbrandwoo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Brandwood","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I can confirm that this issue also affects version 5.5.0.
