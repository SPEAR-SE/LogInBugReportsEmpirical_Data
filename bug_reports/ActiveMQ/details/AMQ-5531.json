Issue is similar to [https://issues.jboss.org/browse/MB-385] and [https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-1973]. \nBelow is my description how to reproduce the issue - I could probably create JUnit test, but I'm unsure how to do this.\n\nh3. Setup\nLets assume that we have two hosts: hostA (192.168.0.1) and hostB (192.168.0.2). \nh4. hostA\nRun brokerA with default configuration, which comes from installation package.\nh4. hostB\nRun brokerB either embedded or standalone - I'm using embedded with following code:\n{code:title=EmbeddedBroker.java}\nBrokerService broker = new BrokerService();\nNetworkConnector connector = broker.addNetworkConnector(\"static:(failover:tcp://192.168.0.1:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=18000000)\");\nconnector.setDuplex(true);\nconnector.setConduitSubscriptions(false);\n{code}\nh4. Startup\nIn brokerA log you should see following:\n{quote}\nINFO | Connector vm://brokerA started\n INFO | Started responder end of duplex bridge NC@ID:hostA-34744-1421847312144-0:1\n INFO | Network connection between vm://brokerA#0 and tcp:///192.168.0.2:65463@61616 (brokerB) has been established.\n{quote}\nIn brokerB log you should see following\n{quote}\n2015-01-21 14:35:12,824 INFO  [triggerStartAsyncNetworkBridgeCreation: remoteBroker=unconnected, localBroker= vm://brokerB#0] org.apache.activemq.network.DemandForwardingBridgeSupport - Network connection between vm://brokerB#0 and tcp://192.168.0.1:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=18000000 (brokerA) has been established.\n{quote}\n\nh3. Test\nOn hostB run command to simulate network failure:\n{{iptables -I OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --dport 61616 -j REJECT --reject-with=icmp-host-unreachable}}\n\nWait until you get on brokerB:\n{quote}\n2015-01-21 14:51:52,735 WARN  [ActiveMQ InactivityMonitor Worker] org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Transport (tcp://192.168.0.1:61616) failed, reason:  org.apache.activemq.transport.InactivityIOException: Channel was inactive for too (>30000) long: tcp://192.168.0.1:61616, attempting to automatically reconnect\n{quote}\nand on brokerA:\n{quote}\nWARN | Network connection between vm://brokerA#0 and tcp:///192.168.0.2:65463@61616 shutdown due to a remote error: org.\npache.activemq.transport.InactivityIOException: Channel was inactive for too (>30000) long: tcp://192.168.0.2:65463\n INFO | Connector vm://brokerA stopped\n INFO | brokerA bridge to brokerB stopped\n{quote}\n\nOn hostB simulate network back to normal:\n{{iptables -D OUTPUT -d 192.168.0.1 -p tcp --dport 61616 -j REJECT --reject-with=icmp-host-unreachable}}\n\nh3. Outcome and summary\nIn brokerB log you should see following:\n{quote}\n2015-01-21 14:52:03,588 INFO  [ActiveMQ Task-3] org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport - Successfully reconnected to tcp://192.168.0.1:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=18000000\n{quote}\n\nOn brokerA there is no sign of restarting responder end of duplex bridge.
