In startAllConnectors, the list is traversed and each connector is started through startTransportConnector(). This method checks if JMX is configured, and if so, it called connector.asManagedConnector() which returns a new instance of a TransportConnector. This instance is started.\n\nBut in the  transportConnectors list of BrokerService, the old, unstarted object is still existent. Since a TransportConnector starts a TransportServiceDetector thread, the old, unstarted instance contains a TSD that is not active. But the started TSD isn't referenced anymore.\n\nOn shutdown, the old, unstarted TC and subsequently TSD are stopped. The \"lost\" instance can't be touched anymore.\n\nMy patch does this: During spin-up, startTransportConnector() returns the instance that is started. The started instances are collected in an arraylist, this list replaces transportConnectors after startup.\n\nThanks to jstrachan for being patient on irc.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460612","id":"12460612","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--tc-jmx-patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vasquez","name":"vasquez","key":"vasquez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mack","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-07T14:17:26.000+0000","size":606,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460612/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--tc-jmx-patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254921","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"TransportConnector get duplicated when used with JMX","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vasquez","name":"vasquez","key":"vasquez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mack","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=vasquez","name":"vasquez","key":"vasquez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mack","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux, ActiveMQ broker in a custom servlet, running on Tomcat 5.5.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481908/comment/12938537","id":"12938537","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jlim","name":"jlim","key":"jlim","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jonas Lim","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks!
