On a lock fail it is not closing the opened files. This is causing the secondary server to run out of number of open files set in the OS. \nCurrent OS is Set to 1024 max open files.\n\nI have been running some tests to validate this and the following is the observations. \n1.

So it tries to get the lock very 10 seconds. \n2.
