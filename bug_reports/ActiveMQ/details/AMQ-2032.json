This mechanism can get in the way of message redelivery, particularly when sessions are closed and an automatic rollback kicks in.\n\nOriginal user comment:\n----\nRedelivery of message fails after a rollback with Spring DMLC with cacheLevel=CACHE_NONE due to a bug in class : 'org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer'. Redelivered messages are wrongly detected as duplicates. It fails to call 'rollbackDuplicates' on messages processed by consumer on rollback call on the consumer.\n\nSequence: ( See: http://fisheye1.atlassian.com/browse/springframework/spring/src/org/springframework/jms/listener/AbstractPollingMessageListenerContainer.java?r=1.14 )\n\n    * Spring creates a transaction\n    * Spring creates a JMS consumer\n    * Spring give message to Application MessageListener class\n    * Spring closes the consumer\n    * Spring try to commit\n    * Commit fails due to a RuntimeException thrown in Application MessageListener class\n    * Spring marks the message as RollbackOnly\n    * Spring rollbacks message\n\n\nWhen ActiveMQ closes the consumer ( org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer ), it clears 'deliveredMessages' list. But this list is needed in rollback method of ActiveMQMessageConsumer to rollback duplicates ! Then consumer cannot rollback duplicates on rollback if consumer is closed before rollback action. The only way I found, is to not clear 'deliveredMessages' list on close. It seems, there is no side effect, since after a call to 'close' method, the consumer is not used anymore.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"171946","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Redelivered messages to consumer skiped due to false duplicate detection on message rollback with Spring and cacheLevel=CACHE_NONE","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Spring DMLC, cacheLevel=CACHE_NONE","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482185/comment/12940561","id":"12940561","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"resolved in 725737\ntest case included with the commit.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-11T16:56:10.429+0000","updated":"2008-12-11T16:56:10.429+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2032/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0tsmf:"}}
