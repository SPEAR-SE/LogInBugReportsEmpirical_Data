Shannon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~tabish121],\n\nI noticed this issue the other day and it's a bit odd to me that advisory messages relating to user actions (such as new connection or consumer, etc)  set the {{originBrokerURL}} property with a default URL and not the actual transport URL that was used.  For example, I ran a test and set up a broker with two transports, one nio and one tcp.  I connected using nio but the algorithm picked the tcp transport url to set as the originBrokerURL property when the new connection advisory message was fired.  It would make more sense to me to set the originBrokerUrl property as the nio URL since that was the URL used.  \n\nThis would be a pretty easy change as the ConnectionContext has a reference to the Connector used and we could get the publishable connection string from that if the connector has been set. For advisory messages that don't contain the connector (such as internal things like message expiration) a default URL can still be chosen in the same manor as it is now.\n\nDo you have any issue with changing this behavior? The other option is to keep the originBrokerURL behavior as is and add a new property to contain the actual transport url used by the client to connect.  That would prevent issues for existing users which might be relying on the current behavior of how the originBrokerURL property is set. \n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
