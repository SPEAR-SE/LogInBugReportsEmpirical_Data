The behavior we are seeing is that messages are redelivered more times than we specified. The problem may be related to the way the redelivery counter is being maintained. We see the redelivery counter incrementing by one for redeliveries to a specific consumer, but then it resets to a lower number when the message is redelivered to a different consumer.\n\nI have attached a test case to demonstrate the problem. The first test is a simple baseline example that passes. The second test shows that messages are being redelivered too many times for the redelivery policy. The third tests catches a regression in the delivery count (redelivery count + 1) when sending a rolled back message to a new consumer.\n\nThe test suite uses an embedded broker using the VM protocol so it should be standalone.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460555","id":"12460555","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--RedeliveryTest.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sbate","name":"sbate","key":"sbate","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Bate","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-09T20:20:11.000+0000","size":11700,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460555/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--RedeliveryTest.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161457","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Incorrect redelivery behavior and counters","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sbate","name":"sbate","key":"sbate","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Bate","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sbate","name":"sbate","key":"sbate","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Steve Bate","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP Pro\njava version \"1.5.0_06\"\n","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482156/comment/12936819","id":"12936819","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=memelet","name":"memelet","key":"memelet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Barry Kaplan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Any chance that this will get some attention?
