It is including percentage blocked regardless of send count or block count. The unit test for the plugin instantiates a new broker and a new connection to that broker, so the first time this plugin fires on the connection, the send count is zero. If I move the log statement to after calling `super.send(producerExchange, messageSend);` the test does not throw the ArithmeticException. There are plenty of ways to work around it in the plugin.\r\n\r\n[1]- [https://gist.github.com/macgregor/c108f1ca5051e6d9b08ab388d17d0126]","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mstratto","name":"mstratto","key":"mstratto","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew Stratton","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2018-07-23T12:41:13.814+0000","updated":"2018-07-23T12:45:05.833+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13173614/comment/16559616","id":"16559616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Commit b79fcd0a768e5c7d45a7f68febf447d8379cbaf4 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from Christopher L.
