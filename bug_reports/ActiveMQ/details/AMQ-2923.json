It orders them by messageID, but sorted by simple string value, so the later message foobar:115 appears before foobar:91, but the messages are correctly ordered on the queue. This annoys me! It should have been fixed by https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/QPID-417 but wasn't. An easy way to fix it would be to zero-pad the number sequence that follows the bit that looks like a timestamp in the MessageID, otherwise the sorting has to be cleverer.\n\nAnyway, you may still be seeing clients picking up messages out of producer order, but the screenshot of the web console doesn't give supporting evidence. I always see messages listed:\n\nfoobar:10\nfoobar:1\nfoobar:20\nfoobar:2\nfoobar:3\n\netc.\n\nbut if I consume them, I get them in 1,2,3 order with 10 & 20 later.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=illtud","name":"illtud","key":"illtud","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Illtud Daniel","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-03-09T16:06:10.708+0000","updated":"2011-03-09T16:06:10.708+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483546/comment/13059490","id":"13059490","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmkgreen","name":"jmkgreen","key":"jmkgreen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Green","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"body":"This is a non-issue, having discussed the stomp log with gtully on irc. I'm recommending that http://activemq.apache.org/stomp.html be updated with the following:\n\nMessage Ordering\n\nWhen delivering messages the broker uses the message-id to order them. This is based on the producer-id which, in the case of STOMP connections, is generated at the point that the producer connects to the broker.\n\nTherefore apparently out-of-order messages may occur. To give an example:\n\n1. Producer p1 connects\n2. Producer p2 connects\n3. Producer p2 sends Message 1 to /queue/test\n4. Producer p1 sends Message 2 to /queue/test several seconds later\n5. Consumer c1 connects and subscribes to /queue/test and receives Message 2 followed by Message 1.\n\n---\n\nHopefully I have interpreted gtully's explanation correctly and this is understandable.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jmkgreen","name":"jmkgreen","key":"jmkgreen","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Green","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"created":"2011-07-04T15:54:06.028+0000","updated":"2011-07-04T15:54:06.028+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483546/comment/13059497","id":"13059497","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"updated the doc: Message Ordering https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/ACTIVEMQ/Stomp\nto reflect the possibility of order inversion from a stomp client perspective.
