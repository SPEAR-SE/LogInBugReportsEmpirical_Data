We built a test harness off of the example based on the fusesource client. It is really straightforward - it creates a thousand connections and then cycles through closing them and opening them. We ran this test overnight several times on different versions of AMQ. After a 100 of cycles the memory heap was at 7Gb after the manually triggered GC. We also tested the hard close by killing the client app and restarting it as well as cutting off network by playing with firewall settings. This is where we got the 300K per close. We ran all of this on the out of the box AMQ config. The only change was we turned on thread pooling and configure nio. The same tests did not show any memory leaks on the openwire connections\n\nI would be happy to share the test harness if it would help any.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mfeingold","name":"mfeingold","key":"mfeingold","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Feingold","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-05-05T15:15:40.492+0000","updated":"2015-05-05T15:16:37.225+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12827045/comment/14528641","id":"14528641","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Thanks, it helps to know what client you are using.

I can share some results.\n\nI created 2 versions of test harness a single file version and batch version. \n\nThe single version (https://github.com/Hill30/amq-tests/tree/master/MQTTDisconnect) runs against a single topic repeats the following operations: connect to the topic, wait for connection, subscribe to the topic QoS=2, disconnect, wait for the disconnect.\n\nThe batch version (https://github.com/Hill30/amq-tests/tree/master/MQTTBatchDisconnect) for every connection on the list of 500 connections it creates a connection, and once it connects successfully it subscribes to the topic. After the process of creating connections is completed, it disconnects all of them. Then the process is repeated. \n\nHere is what I have discovered\n\n1. The single file test did not reliably show any memory leaks. Several test runs of 100000 connect/subscribe/disconnect cycles show memory increase of 200 bytes per cycle, which may be just an inconsistency in the way heap size is measured.\n\n2. The batch test shows memory leak of ~75K per connect/disconnect on 5.10.2 and ~35K per on 5.12 SNAPSHOT. The most puzzling part is that after the batch test has been run, all other tests (including the single file) start leaking at the same rate. This behavior continues even after broker restart.\n\nOn the side note, repeating subscribe for the session has no impact on the memory leak\n\nYou can examine the results of the test runs here: https://github.com/Hill30/amq-tests/blob/master/MQTTBatchDisconnect/src/com/hill30/AMQTests/runs.txt\n\nAMQ configuration is taken out of the box - just unzipped and started","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mfeingold","name":"mfeingold","key":"mfeingold","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Feingold","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-05-09T17:33:58.511+0000","updated":"2015-05-09T17:42:05.625+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12827045/comment/14538279","id":"14538279","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"I tried your test cases against both a 5.12-SNAPSHOT and 5.11.2 build and see no leaks.

It looks like every time a connection to any topic is closed, some memory is leaked. The amount of memory leaked is ~100b times number of currently existing durable topics. Therefore if the number of durable topics is low, the leak us so slow you can hardly see it. Also if connect/disconnect is happening only once in a blue moon - same thing. In my use case both are pretty high, so here we are.\n\nI captured a few memory dumps while I was running my tests and they show that every time a connection is disconnected, for every durable topic there are 2 objects leaking - a hashmap and a linkedlist Node. You  can clearly see it in the heapdump compare screenshot (attached https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12732941/Screen%20Shot%202015-05-14%20at%202.06.02%20PM.png).

The connect/dosconnect cyscle was repeated 50000 times.\n4. another heapdump created\n\nWhat you see in the picture is a comparison between the two. You can clearly see the 2 culprits.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mfeingold","name":"mfeingold","key":"mfeingold","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Michael Feingold","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-05-14T20:00:54.386+0000","updated":"2015-05-14T20:00:54.386+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12827045/comment/14544306","id":"14544306","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"I've found the issue already, and have a patch going in soon.
