For a message targeted to a temporary destination,  this causes a TemporaryDestinationAdvisor object to be created and started.  The message destination is then processed through the ActiveMQConnection.validateDestination().  However if the TemporaryDestinationAdvisor has not yet processed the TempDestinationAdvisoryEvent then the validation will fail.  In my case, there was about a 200ms delay between the \"start\" of the TemporaryDestinationAdvisor and the processing of the event.\n\nAs a fix I introduced a sleep(500) after initiating the TemporaryDestinationAdvisor.  This gives the time for the advisory event to be processed.  Now this is not an idle solution since it could cause unwanted latencies or be to short a delay in other cases.  But unless someone can suggest something better, it is all I have at this point.
