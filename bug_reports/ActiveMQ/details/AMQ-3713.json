There will be an increase in db-*.log files along with this there is an increase in the size of tmpDB.data file. Let the temp store percentage grow up to 90% without triggering the consumer. Once the temp store is 90% start the consumer. The log files are deleted once the messages are consumed but tmpDB.data file does not decrease in size and this causes  the temp store to be 60 - 70% full.  \n\nIssues with this with slow consumer, which does not call for a producer flow control, temp store % keeps growing and at one particular point of time hits 100% just because of tmpDB.data file and hence no messages can be produced on to AMQ without a restart of it.\n\nIn my case this situation occurs very quickly when one of the consumer goes down as the load on AMQ is high.\n\nThe above is the case with persistent store as well.
