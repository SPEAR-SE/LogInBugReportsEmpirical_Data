As you pointed out, the best work around is probably to use concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics=\"false\" for now.\n\nIn detail, the issue lies in the setLastCacheId method in AbstractStoreCursor which you can see in the stack trace.  In the else clause in that method lastCachedIds[ index].getFutureOrSequenceLong() is returning null because it hasn't been set yet.  KahaDB assigns that value when the message is added to the store in a transaction.   However the TopicStorePefetch cursor is calling trackLastCached before KahaDB actually gets around to finishing the transaction and assigning the value, which happens asynchronously.\n\n[~tabish121] and [~gtully], What do you guys thisnk about this?  It's certainly easy enough to add a null check but then the value is never cached in setLastCachedId as it just skips it.  This may not actually be a problem depending on what the lastCacheId is used for.  If I add a null check in, the test case passes but it seems like there could be a larger concurrency issue here that might need to be resolved besides just adding in a check for a null.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.

In the queue case, it does have a beneficial effect b/c it is just a single client that needs to ack fast.\n2) what lastCacheId is used for? When the cache is full it stops tracking messages and when the cache is empty, to avoid replaying all messages from the store the cursor wants to start a store replay from the last message that it cached. There is a setBatch that sets the start point. Implicit in this is that the sequenceId in the store is in sync with the order messages are placed in the cursor. That is the crux of it. If the start point is off, there is a potential for a missed dispatch or a duplicate dispatch. Note - I think the durable topic case is a little simpler because of the per sub index, but that would need to be validated.\n\nIn the queue case, there are a bunch of hoops that ensure ordering because it is complicated with concurrentStoreAndDispatch. The same attention has not been given to the topic case to date.\nIf there is a proven usecase for  concurrentStoreAndDispatchTopics=true (point 1) - then the is a case for migrating the work done on queue cursors around lastCacheId to topics.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-06-11T12:06:41.918+0000","updated":"2015-06-11T12:06:41.918+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12782550/comment/14582049","id":"14582049","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
