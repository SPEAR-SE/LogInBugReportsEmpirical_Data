If you list multiple servers and the connection to the initial fails, the reconnect process will not complete properly.  This is cause because of the firing order of status events.  In the TcpTransportChannel.doClose() method the call to onAsyncException() will cause the Reliable class to fire a status event for disconnected, then after establishing the connection to the next server it will fire a status event for reconnected.  Finally after control returns to the doClose() method another status event for disconnected is fired.  All of these events are received by the ActiveMQConnection.statusChanged() method and are interpreted to set the ActiveMQConnection.isTransportOK member.  With the series of events as listed above:\n\ndisconnected\nreconnected\ndisconnected\n\nyou can see why the state of ActiveMQConnection.isTransportOK is incorrect after a reconnect.\n\nI did not know if it were safe to actually remove the final fireStatusEvent() call from the TcpTransportChannel.doClose(), so did the next best thing.  I moved it up before the the call to onAsyncException() .  This changed the order of the events to:\n\ndisconnected\ndisconnected\nreconnected\n\nThis fixed my problem, but I am not sure it is the proper fix.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161534","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Reliable reconnection process is broken","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"W2k java 1.4.2_05","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-211/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s0cv:"}}
