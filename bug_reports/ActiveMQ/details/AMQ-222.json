I haven't been able to reproduce the condition, but here's a quick breakdown of how I'm using the broker:\n- A single queue that passes large ObjectMessages from 11 writers to a single reader\n- A topic that messages small ObjectMessages to 11 readers from a single writer\n\nThe message frequency is about 1 per second max, with normal rates being about 2 per minute (very low). I'm using the default derby store, with two connectors listening on two different interfaces. The clients all have a manual reconnect if they get a JMS exception, closing and re-opening the connection to the broker.\n\nAfter about a week of production runtime, the broker seems to start generating OutOfMemoryErrors. It seems to keep accepting TCP connections when in this state, but the clients that connect to it hang during the connect.
