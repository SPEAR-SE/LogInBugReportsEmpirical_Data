(unless consumers have priorities, and then all bets might be off, but we don't use priorities).\n\nwe use activemq as an embedded library, so all configuration is programmatic, not xml.  i believe the config you are asking for is the DiscoveryNetworkConnector:\n\n* prefetchSize = 1\n* duplex = false\n* messageTTL = 9999\n\nalso the ConditionalNetworkBridgeFilterFactory has replayWhenNoConsumers = true.\n\nthe exclusiveSub isn't used other than for checking non-null.  the effect of the patch is that any exclusive consumers other than the first are ignored when checking for a local consumer.  so even though there _is_ a local consumer in my test scenario, since it is an exclusive consumer and is not the first in line, it is ignored.\n\nthat's a good point about this being a factory which i'm plugging in.  technically i could use my own modified subclass.  that said, it would be good if the core features worked as intended/expected without custom impls.  not to mention that the relevant problem code is not easily re-usable, so i'd have to duplicate a fair bit of code (if not the entire class).","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jahlborn","name":"jahlborn","key":"jahlborn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-10-05T17:32:29.541+0000","updated":"2016-10-05T17:35:28.305+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13009893/comment/15551469","id":"15551469","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"the exclusive *choice* is local to a broker.\nIf there are two brokers networked together and two consumers connecting to each broker, there is race to figure which consumer gets all the messages.\nEach consumer has a corresponding \"forwarding\" consumer on the other broker. It is the forwarding consumer that has to be deemed locally exclusive if messages are to get bridged. This is totally timing dependent. The forwarding consumer may well not be the exclusive consumer and not get any messages to forward.\n\nSome changes may help make this work.\n1) only network the current exclusive consumer, at the moment this information is lost but could be included in the advisory\n2) allow replay if the forwarding consumer is the current exclusive consumer.\n3) use org.apache.activemq.network.NetworkBridgeConfiguration#setConsumerPriorityBase and decreaseNetworkConsumerPriority to ensure that a network or forwarding consumer will replace a local consumer.\n\n#3 is the tricky bit, because there will always be a race between competing consumers on different brokers. With 3, there is priority to bridging and maybe the reverse would be better.\nIn addition the race is still there between the advisory messages being sent and processed. It may need some coordination w.r.t sync dispatch to ensure the logic is deterministic.\nIn all this won't be trivial. \nBecause there is no distributed lock on a distributed queue (that is what you have, to some extent, with a network), the best we can do is coordinate to pick a value and enforce that.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-10-06T09:37:29.142+0000","updated":"2016-10-06T09:37:29.142+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13009893/comment/15551835","id":"15551835","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jahlborn","name":"jahlborn","key":"jahlborn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I'm confused by your answer.  are you saying that the exclusive concumer feature is fundamentally broken?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jahlborn","name":"jahlborn","key":"jahlborn","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2016-10-06T12:39:05.276+0000","updated":"2016-10-06T12:39:05.276+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13009893/comment/15551986","id":"15551986","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"if by fundamentally you mean \"in a network of brokers\" then yes.
