The keepAlive updates this record from time to time and in the doClose() method the transaction is rolled back (?) which closes the transaction.\n\nThis means the transaction is open the complete time that the master broker is master.\n\nThis interferes in the way that postgresql reclaims deleted records. This is done with a process called VACUUM. What vacuum does is to see in which transaction a row was deleted and if this transaction is before the start of the longest running active transaction it is added back to the free list to be reused.\n\nSince the broker keeps the transaction open, postgresql can never reclaim deleted rows in the activemq_msgs and activemq_acks tables so that these tables are essentially continuously appended to, leading to degrading performance over time.\n\nexample output:\n\nINFO:  vacuuming \"public.activemq_msgs\"\nINFO:  \"activemq_msgs\": found 0 removable, 1513322 nonremovable row versions in 265477 pages\nDETAIL:  1505390 dead row versions cannot be removed yet.\n\nThis output was for a table with about 8000 active messages in the queues, however the actual table on disk contained 1.5M rows. \n\nThis leads to terrible performance over time.\n\nIt appears the LeaseDatabaseLocker does not exhibit this behavior.\n\nI think that 'fixing' this in the documentation by adding a warning not to use default database locker with postgresql is the simplest solution.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DefaultDatabaseLocker is incompatible with Postgresql","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=snamellit","name":"snamellit","key":"snamellit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Peter Tillemans","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=snamellit","name":"snamellit","key":"snamellit","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Peter Tillemans","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5359/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2033b:"}}
