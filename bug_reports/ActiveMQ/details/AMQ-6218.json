The issue is that KahaDB calls beoreMarshall() when storing which then calls storeContentAndClear() on the message which clears out the text field.  With concurrent store and dispatch on this can cause both content and text to end up null if the marshalling happens at the same time the message is being copied in another thread.  \n\nI fixed this by grabbing a copy of the text before the rest of the copy method is called and then using that as the value.  The other methods in ActiveMQTextMessage follow a similar pattern of grabbing local references of the text and content fields to try and minimize other threads from interfering.\n\nI did not add synchronization to prevent a performance hit but If other issues pop up we might need to explicitly synchronize access on those two fields in a future version to prevent other race conditions.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
