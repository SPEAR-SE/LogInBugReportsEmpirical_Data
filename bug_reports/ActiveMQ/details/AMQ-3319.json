Additions and removals to/from this collection are wrapped by a shared readLock, which means there is no guard against concurrent modification and there is also a possibility of a race condition between isEmpty and removeFirst call during concurrent usages of getNextBrowserDispatch (if they are possible).\n\nI think the easiest fix is to switch from LinkedList to ConcurrentLinkedQueue and make use of Queue methods to access the collection (because they allow single step isEmpty/remove call). I am attaching a patch that does it. I've left the readLocks in case they are used to block writes someplace else, but they are not needed anymore for concurrency control over the new collection.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12479014","id":"12479014","filename":"patch.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pbruski_","name":"pbruski_","key":"pbruski_","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Przemek
