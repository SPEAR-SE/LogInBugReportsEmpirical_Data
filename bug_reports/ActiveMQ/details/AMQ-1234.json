All our producer / consumer\nobjects extend a connection which remains constant throughout the\noperation.  If the network is interrupted the connection does indeed\nreconnect and continue when the network returns.\n\nWe've configured the broker to only use an openwire connector (ssl and\nstomp are disabled)\n\nDescription of problem:\n\nAfter several hours (between 7 and 12 hours), it seems as if the\nbroker port disappears and messages produced just go nowhere.\nConsumers continue to run, however never consuming anything.  They\nindication the connection is find and they are waiting on the queue.\nNo errors ever occur in either producer, consumer or broker.\n\nWe have changed the config slightly with seeming success.  Instead of\nrunning two brokers, we now run 5.  One on every machine, with the\nmulticast auto discovery system enabled. Every producer / consumer now\nconnects to localhost instead.\n\nThis is also very acceptable, however we would like to know why a\nsustained connection cannot be maintained to a local area network\nhost.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254989","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Broker fails to dispatch messages","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=balahura","name":"balahura","key":"balahura","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"robert balahura","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=balahura","name":"balahura","key":"balahura","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"robert balahura","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS: Redhat Linux 2.6.9-42.0.8.ELsmp\nJava 1.5.0.11\nActiveMQ 4.1.1","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1234/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1815j:"}}
