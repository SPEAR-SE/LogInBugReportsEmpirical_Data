Is it applicable to topics also. In the case of topics there is such a scenario like we are creating a topic for each login by appending login id and a newly created session key. so this will be different for each login for a same client. This is not queue but topic. Is this can create the above issue. One thing is that previous topics created for a client will not be used again, so will it be automatically deleted from the binary tree index or I need to explicitly delete it. How to delete topic, i could not see api for delete in jms spec. \n\nAlthough now this system is not that large, we really want to scale number of clients. We have a working system, which has nearly 30000 clients base perday, which uses proprietory technologies like Tibco Rendezvous Messaging system,Oracle DB etc. Our goal of this application, which uses open source technologies (activemq, mysql, jboss etc) is to replace that big system with in a 1 year of target.
