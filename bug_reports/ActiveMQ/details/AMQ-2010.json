In current build of activemq, META-INF/services files are all stored in META-INF/services dir under activemq-core bundle.On the other hand, namespace parser is in xbean.spring bundle (referenced by META-INF/spring.handlers). Because parser is in separate bundle, it can not \"see\" META-INF/services directory, and it dies. Also, import for org.apache.xbean.spring.context.v2 is missing from activemq-core. Additionally, for bundle loader to scan for spring.schema file, bundle _must_ import org.springframework.beans.factory.xml, which is also missing from manifest file. I'm not 100% shure in this, maybe all files from META-INF/services should be moved from activemq-core to xbaen.spring ...\n\nAnyhow, fix to make it work is to:\n- move META-INF/services in propriate bundles\n- add following import to activemq-core:\n org.springframework.beans.factory.xml;resolution:=optional,\n org.apache.xbean.spring.context.v2;resolution:=optional\n\nThat's it for now. :-)\n\nH.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"172470","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"META-INF/services files ended up in wrong bundle (jar), missing imports","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiborg","name":"hiborg","key":"hiborg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hrvoje Habjanic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hiborg","name":"hiborg","key":"hiborg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hrvoje Habjanic","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Springsource DM 1.0.0.RC2, java jdk (sun) 1.6_07, Linux 32bit","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483700/comment/12940757","id":"12940757","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kneumei","name":"kneumei","key":"kneumei","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kyle Neumeier","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I am having the same problem.
