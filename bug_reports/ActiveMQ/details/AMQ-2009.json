This problem is described in several posts.\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Pending-Messages-are-shown-in-ActiveMQ-td20241332.html\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Consumer-Listener-stop-receving-message-until-ActiveMQ-restart-td20355247.html\n\nhttp://www.nabble.com/Stuck-messages---Dispatch-issues-td20467949.html\n\nThere was also an issue opened in Spring project for this thinking it was Spring problem.\n\nhttp://jira.springframework.org/browse/SPR-5110\n\nI am not able to reproduce with Junit test case having BrokerService started with in the test case. I guess I am not hitting the right stress conditions this way. But when I run the test case against an externally running ActiveMQ instance backed with oracle database persistence, it is reproducible most of the times. This is not a every time failure situation, it takes more time once than the other.\n\nI was able to hit this situation of stuck messages on queue using following scenario most of the times:\n\n1) Start 2 concurrent consumers for the queue using Spring's DefaultMessageListenerContainer using cacheLevelName as CACHE_CONSUMER\n2) Send messages using JMETER 2.3.2 to the queue on ActiveMQ stand alone broker instance with 50 threads looping 20 times.\n3) After a while, you will notice that Spring logs that no messages are being received but the messages are shown jconsole of ActiveMQ and the database backing it for persistence.\n\nBut in 5.2 RC3, the problem is that it dispatches duplicate messages and does not remove them from broker's database after acknowledge properly.\n\nAttached test case might help to reproduce when run against externally running stand alone ActiveMQ broker. Another way to see the problem is that try to load test using JMETER by sending messages to a queue with a camel route that moves messages from this queue to another and you will notice that it stops moving after while or copied duplicates in case of 5.2 RC3.\n\nSorry about such a huge description but it is a real problem! A different team at our company are having this issue in production with 5.1. They are using it as an embedded broker with derby for persistence.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461417","id":"12461417","filename":"AMQ-2009Testcase2.zip","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten

Because P1 produces faster than C1 can consume, we get a fast producer / slow consumer for that topic.\n\nAt the end of the run, there are 6 million messages on the queue, but if you add a consumer to the queue, it won't consume any messages. If you browse the queue using the webconsole, it appears empty. Only restarting ActiveMQ gets q1 working again.\n\nIn our previous tests, we discovered that this \"freezing\" of dispatching (it affects other queues than q1 as well) starts somewhere during the publishing of the 6 million messages to t1.\n\nWe are using a standalone broker, Kaha for persistence and Spring 2.5.4 for JMS support.\n\nOS: Linux (2.6.18-92.1.18.el5 #1 SMP Wed Nov 12 09:19:49 EST 2008 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux)\nJava: \n  java version \"1.6.0_10\"\n  Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_10-b33)\n  Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 11.0-b15, mixed mode)\n\nWe have tested with 5.1.0, 5.2.0 and 5.3-SNAPSHOT.

This new testcase also reproduces the same behavior however I do not believe this testcase shows a bug. Let me explain why.\n\nBoth consumers listen on the same queue. \nThe first consumer only closes its session *after* the second consumer tried to receive the message that the second producer sent to the queue. So the first consumer is still active when the second consumer calls f_consumer.receive(5000);\n\nSo what happens at runtime is that even though both consumers use a pull mode (by calling consumer.receive(5000); ) there is a default prefetch size (as this is not set explicitly) that is used for each consumer. \nThe first consumer acked the first message so it is available to receive more messages (even though it does not actively call f_consumer.receive()). So when the second message appears on the queue, the broker sends it right to the *first consumer* where it stays in the prefetch queue until it either gets received by the consumer calling f_consumer.receive() or the session gets closed. If in the testcase you call \n{code:java}\nconsumerTest.receiveMessage(dinges);\n{code}\n\nrather than \n{code:java}\nconsumerTestNew.receiveMessage(dinges);\n{code}\nthe message is received fine. \n\nSo there are two ways to work around this:\n\n1. have the first consumer close its session before the second consumer receives the message:\n{code:title=ConsumerProblemTest.java}\n...\nconsumerTest.close();\n\n//create second consumer and read msg\nDurableConsumer consumerTestNew = new DurableConsumer();\nconsumerTestNew.init();\nconsumerTestNew.receiveMessage(dinges);\nconsumerTestNew.close();\n{code}\n\n\n2. use a prefetch limit of 0 so messages to not get prefetched to consumers:\n{code:title=DurableConsumer.java}\nenv.put(InitialContext.PROVIDER_URL, \"tcp://localhost:61616?jms.prefetchPolicy.queuePrefetch=0\");\n{code}\n\nWith any of the two changes the testcase succeeds. Give it a go. Simply run mvn test, it should fail out of the box. Then make these changes, the testcase will succeed.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2009-03-18T18:07:48.936+0000","updated":"2009-03-18T18:14:12.562+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483280/comment/12941021","id":"12941021","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sherriff","name":"sherriff","key":"sherriff","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Erik Drolshammer","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Could this be related to https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-2169?

Regarding the demandforwarding bridge, do you know the name of the thread I shall look in jconsole. due to the complexity of our system, there are about 170 live threads in the jconsole for this broker. Maybe a thread is blocked. \n\nAny suggestion is welcome. I am looking into this issue until i find a fix.
