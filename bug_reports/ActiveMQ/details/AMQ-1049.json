I've tried with 4.0.1 and 4.1.  The symptom was that, although the broker is set as an intercepter and it detects a bad password and emits a SecurityException, the producer is still allowed to produce messages.  I can see the producer get the bad login indication through the following log message: \n\nWARN  org.apache.activemq.network.DemandForwardingBridge - Unexpected remote command: ConnectionError {commandId = 2, responseRequired = false, connectionId = null, exception = java.lang.SecurityException: User name or password is invalid.}\n\nBut then, the next thing I know, my consumers, that have successfully logged in, start receiving messages from this very same producer.\n\nAfter some investigation, I've been able to get the behavior I want, but I had to modify AbstractConnection.java to do it.  I dont know if my modifications are appropriate, so could someone take a look and let me know whether this is a desirable change or not?\n\nSpecifically, I added an additional catch block after line 202 of AbstractConnection and before the catch(Throwable).  The new code is: \n\ncatch ( SecurityException e1)\n   {\n   ConnectionError ce = new ConnectionError();\n   ce.setException(e1);\n   dispatchSync(ce);\n   try\n      {\n      this.stop();\n      }\n   catch (Exception e2)\n      {\n      serviceLog.error(\"Unable to stop the connection after the SecurityException:  \" + e2);\n      }\n\nNotice the dispatchSync versus dispatchAsync - I did this to ensure that the client was informed off the security violation before the connection is stopped.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"172337","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"SimpleAuthenticationBroker and AbstractConnection allow messages from a Producer that fails logon","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chrish","name":"chrish","key":"chrish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Hofstaedter","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chrish","name":"chrish","key":"chrish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Hofstaedter","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"The OS is Windows XP.
