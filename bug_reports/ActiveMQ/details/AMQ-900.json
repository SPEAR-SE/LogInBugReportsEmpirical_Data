For each element in the enumeration, I spawn a worker thread to consume a message in non-blocking fashion from within a transacted session. This works fine for 1 message. The problem is that when I enqueue more than one message, subsequent calls to receiveNoWait() return null, although there must be messages in the queue.\n\nI have created a test case to reproduce this (ActiveMQTestCase) which is part of the m2 project that I have attached. This can be executed in the normal m2 fashion by running \"mvn test\" on the command line.\n\nThis problem originally arose when I was using ActiveMQ 4.0.1 as a JMS transport for Mule 1.3rc4 and I created a Mule specific message receiver that tried to exploit the non-transactional browsing and offloading to transactional worker threads strategy that I have implemented in the test case.\n\nSo to eliminate any interaction from Mule, I used a different JMS provider, and the message receiver worker fine (with Joram and Weblogic).\n\nI also tried a 4.1-snaphot of ActiveMQ, but it behaved the same as the 4.0.1 release.\n\nSo then I wrote a test case using pure JMS against ActiveMQ 4.0.1 (see attachment), and the behaviour is consistent with that what I was getting from within Mule -  the first message gets consumed properly, then subsequent messages don't get dequeued.\n\nTherefore I think this may be an issue with ActiveMQ.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460829","id":"12460829","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--browsing_jms_receiver.7z","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=0x6e6562","name":"0x6e6562","key":"0x6e6562","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ben Hood","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-08-29T15:42:41.000+0000","size":8318,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460829/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--browsing_jms_receiver.7z"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161773","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Inconsistent queue browsing and message dequeueing behaviour","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=0x6e6562","name":"0x6e6562","key":"0x6e6562","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ben Hood","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=0x6e6562","name":"0x6e6562","key":"0x6e6562","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ben Hood","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Win2K, java 1.5.0_07-b03","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482397/comment/12939477","id":"12939477","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Set prefetch = 0 for your consumer","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-10T07:19:49.222+0000","updated":"2008-04-10T07:19:49.222+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-900/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s1tz:"}}
