The call to {{close()}} calls {{stop()}} and this will call {{checkClosedOrFailed()}} which is {{synchronized}}, too, and there is the deadlock.\n\nThe patch has removed the {{synchronized}} on the {{ensureConnectionInfoSent()}} and uses a mutex instead to prevent calling the method unsynchronized.\n\nAnother problem is that {{PooledConnectionFactory}} is triggered from Spring classes to create connections even if the PooledConnectionFactory was stopped (call to {{stop()}} and the new created connections can not be stopped normally later. \nI have added a {{stopped}} flag that prevents the creation of new connecions after {{stop()}} was called.\n\nI think the issue AMQ-1470 is related to the same problem. \nThe patch also contains the patch for AMQ-1791.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461079","id":"12461079","filename":"amq-1810.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=akuhtz","name":"akuhtz","key":"akuhtz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=akuhtz&avatarId=14846","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=akuhtz&avatarId=14846","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=akuhtz&avatarId=14846","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=akuhtz&avatarId=14846"},"displayName":"Andreas
