is related to AMQ-5960, marked as fixed, but the issue persists.  \n\nIt is very easy to reproduce.\n\n1)  Start up ActiveMQ\n2)  Produce load into a topic\n3)  Connect a few durable subscribers to the topic\n4)  Force-terminate the running broker instance \n5)  Restart the broker (without load)\n6)  Allow durable subscribers to reconnect, and attempt to drain the durable subscription queues\n\nIn almost every case, you will see the pending queue sizes of the durable subscribers with lingering \"messages.\"  I say that in quotes, because I have been able to prove that all the messages are in fact delivered to the clients, there's no message loss, but, KahaDB still thinks that there are messages waiting to be dispatched.\n\nThis causes KahaDB to be unable to clean up extents and ultimately will cause the KahaDB store to grow out of control, hence the \"Major\" severity despite no actual message loss occurring.\n\nThe only way to recover from the situation is to delete and recreate the subscriber, which does allow KahaDB to clean itself up.\n\nI have tried several things, including disabling the new ackCompation functionality, significantly reducing the time between checkpoints, reducing the size of the index cache to force more frequent flushes to disk, but none of those completely eliminate the problem.\n\nThis does not happen with LevelDB, but, of course LevelDB has been deprecated, so it's not a good solution to switch to that.  Does not happen with JDBC either, but, JDBC is as we know significantly slower than KahaDB, so ideally we'd see this fixed in KahaDB.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12862749","id":"12862749","filename":"localhost___Durable_Topic_Subscribers.jpg","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jreock","name":"jreock","key":"jreock","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Reock","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2017-04-10T22:17:17.563+0000","size":60728,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12862749/localhost___Durable_Topic_Subscribers.jpg"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Durable subscriber pendingQueueSize not flushed with KahaDB after force-kill of broker","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jreock","name":"jreock","key":"jreock","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Reock","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jreock","name":"jreock","key":"jreock","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Reock","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Reproducible in Linux and Windows","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13063024/comment/15963599","id":"15963599","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"this may be resolved via AMQ-6652","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-04-10T22:40:30.432+0000","updated":"2017-04-10T22:40:30.432+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6654/votes","votes":2,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3dghr:"}}
