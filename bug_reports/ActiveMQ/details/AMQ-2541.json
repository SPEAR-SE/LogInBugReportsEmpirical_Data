 - ActiveMQ JMS Message Broker (localhost, ID:vic-esx4-ns1-1280-1261178686846-0:0) started\n\nCause\n=====\nThe broker's network connector is implemented by org.apache.activemq.network.DiscoveryNetworkConnector, which in turn uses org.apache.activemq.transport.discovery.simple.SimpleDiscoveryAgent to determine whether the URLs configured in uri=\"static:(tcp://host1:61616,tcp://host2:61616,tcp://..) \" are active.  SimpleDiscoveryAgent#start() has this loop:\n\n    public void start() throws Exception {\n        running.set(true);\n        for (int i = 0; i < services.length; i++) {\n            listener.onServiceAdd(new SimpleDiscoveryEvent(services[i]));\n        }\n    }\n\n\"listener.onServiceAdd(...) \" is called for each URL and is implemented by DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...).  The main thread calls BrokerService#start()  which calls DiscoveryNetworkConnector#start() which calls SimpleDiscoveryAgent#start(), which sequentially calls DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...).  Since the URLs being \"discovered\" are inactive, DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...)  blocks ~1m30s (this will depend on network configuration) for each URL.  This blocks the main thread that is trying to start the broker.  If there are several inactive URLs, then the blocking time becomes excessive.\n\nSolution\n=======\nIf you follow through the DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...) method, it eventially calls SimpleDiscoveryAgent#serviceFailed(...) for each inactive URL.  In turn SimpleDiscoveryAgent#serviceFailed(...) launches an asynchronous task that pauses for the configured reconnect delay, and then retries the call to DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...).  So it must be safe to call DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...) concurrently.  Therefore, SimpleDiscoveryAgent#start()'s loop should be changed to launch asynchronous tasks to make the DiscoveryNetworkConnector#onServiceAdd(...) calls concurrently rather than synchronously.\n\nThis solution has the benefit of returning control immediately to the caller of SimpleDiscoveryAgent#start(...), thus starting the broker faster, and allows the network discovery to find \"active\" URLs much faster (i.e., with the sequential loop, if the \"active\" URL is the last one, its discovery is significantly delayed).\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12553417","id":"12553417","filename":"AMQ2541.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stirlingc","name":"stirlingc","key":"stirlingc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stirling

AMQ-3195 addressed the case where *multiple* network connectors started synchronously.  Within a single network connector, the bridges were started synchronously.  AMQ-2541 addresses the behaviour within a single network connector so that the bridges are started asynchronously.  The rationale for AMQ-2541 is the same as AMQ-3195 --- sometimes establishing a bridge can be very slow and holds up subsequent bridge formation.\n\nIn our use case, we only have a single network connector, but it is configured with multiple URLs.  Since this is a single network connector, AMQ-3195 does not help since the multiple URLs within the network connector are attempted synchronously.
