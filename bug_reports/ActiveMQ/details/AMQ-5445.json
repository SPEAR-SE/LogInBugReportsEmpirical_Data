Commiting now.}}\n\nHaving analyzed the problem, we discovered, that when Glassfish is going down the method endpoint#beforeDelivery (org.apache.activemq.ra.ServerSessionImpl#beforeDelivery) does not start an XA transaction. So ActiveMQ starts a local transaction in org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession#doStartTransaction. After that ActiveMQSession#run tries to call messageListener.onMessage() and it fails with an exception. Exception is handled in ActiveMQSession#run, but is not propagated to org.apache.activemq.ra.ServerSessionImpl#afterDelivery. And in org.apache.activemq.ra.ServerSessionImpl#afterDelivery there is finally {}Â clause, which commits the session if there is local transaction (and there is one - see above) despite the exception occurred before.\nThis last commit seems to be inappropriate. In case of a transaction (local or not) the corresponding message may not be acknowledged - it must be rollbacked (no session commit).","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Message acknowledged despite of an exception thrown by a message driven bean","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows, Glassfish 3.1.2.2 with AMQ RAR, ActiveMQ 5.10.0 running standalone.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12756715/comment/14219502","id":"14219502","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"And the patch would be I guess to extend the catch {} clause in org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSession#run and make it look something like this:\n\n{code}\n            } catch (Throwable e) {\n                LOG.error(\"error dispatching message: \", e);\n                // A problem while invoking the MessageListener does not\n                // in general indicate a problem with the connection to the broker, i.e.\n                // it will usually be sufficient to let the afterDelivery() method either\n                // commit or roll back in order to deal with the exception.\n                // However, we notify any registered client internal exception listener\n                // of the problem.\n                connection.onClientInternalException(e);\n                if (transactionContext != null && transactionContext.isInLocalTransaction()) {\n                    try {\n                        rollback();\n                    } catch (Throwable rollbackException) {\n                        LOG.error(\"Error while trying to rollback the session\", rollbackException);\n                        connection.onClientInternalException(rollbackException);\n                    }\n                }\n{code}\n\nor may be there is another way to let org.apache.activemq.ra.ServerSessionImpl#afterDelivery know that it has to rollback instead of committing. I did not find an easy way to do this. It would be better to rollback in ServerSessionImpl#afterDelivery - it is also mentioned in the comment in that catch{} clause. So currently ServerSessionImpl#afterDelivery does not know anything about whether it has to rollback or commit. It is just committing.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-11-20T15:42:42.453+0000","updated":"2014-11-20T15:46:53.472+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12756715/comment/14271003","id":"14271003","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Any comments on this issue?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=barlabanov","name":"barlabanov","key":"barlabanov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Sergiy Barlabanov","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-01-09T13:32:00.793+0000","updated":"2015-01-09T13:32:00.793+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5445/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i22lwf:"}}
