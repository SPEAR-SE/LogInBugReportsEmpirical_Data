Had an AbortSlowConsumerStrategy in place which was initially masking the problem as the reconnect caused messages to flow again. However removing this causes the consumers to receive a burst of messages then the flow stops indefinitely (whilst messages get discarded on the server as evidenced by the PendingQueueSize in JMX), so looks like nothing is getting acked. \n\nFrom the discussion on AMQ-3607 I understand that by default once 65% of the prefetch is full (or after a configurable period of time once Gary's patch from AMQ-3607 is available), a batch of acks should be sent.\n\nHave created a test case to reproduce this (attached):\n\n{code:title=testWithoutOptimiseAcknowledge}\nPublisher: Send 0\nFastConsumer:
