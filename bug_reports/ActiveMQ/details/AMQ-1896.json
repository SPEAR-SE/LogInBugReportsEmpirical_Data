Initially with all three consumers being started and the producer sending messages, the exclusive consumer feature works fine. \nHowever if you kill and restart each consumer in a row, allowing another consumer to take over, you will eventually reach a state where a newly started consumer that should not be allowed to receive messages (as another active consumer already has the exclusive right) will also start receiving messages. Typically the msg numbers it receives are of higher numbers than those to be delivered next (e.g. exclusive consumer receives msg number 500 while new consumer receives msg number 1500). \nSo this bug violates:\n- having just one exclusive consumer at any time\n- delivering all msgs in order.\n\nI could not reproduce this problem using the default AMQ store.
