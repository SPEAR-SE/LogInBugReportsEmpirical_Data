this will likely be the culprit.  The stale lock is going to be caused by the OS (NFS/SMB/etc) and that may end up requiring some tuning and investigation to see why there is an issue.  I do not think this has to do with ActiveMQ.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jgenender","name":"jgenender","key":"jgenender","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jeff
