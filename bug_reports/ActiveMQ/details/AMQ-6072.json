Another option is to enable the AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy on the broker to disconnect consumers that have not acknowledged a Message after some configurable time period. \n{quote}\n\nSprings DMLC does not pool consumers in the traditional sense of placing idle consumers into a pool until they are requested. \nSpring caches consumers in their active JMS consumer threads. So these cached JMS consumers remain active and remain used to consume the next available message. There are not pooled in the way how Springs CachingConnectionFactory would pool them. It is therefore not necessary to configure a prefetch of 0 in this use case. \n\nI suggest to remove that paragraph that I quote above. The remaining text on chapter \"Pooled Consumers and prefetch\" remains valid. \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"[doc] Comment on DMLC and prefetch=0 on \"Pooled Consumers and prefetch\" chapter seems wrong.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6072/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2peuf:"}}
