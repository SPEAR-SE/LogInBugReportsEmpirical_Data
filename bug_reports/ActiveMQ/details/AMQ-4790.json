When I resume the machine the next day or (much worse) after a week-end, my PC is busy at 100% CPU for a few minutes.  Because many threads are busy in parallel, the PC is completely unresponsive and the even the mouse cursor can hardly move.\nI had noticed that it only happens when my ServiceMix is started, and when the embedded ActiveMQ broker is configured with a JDBC persistence adapter.\nAfter investigating in the code, I found out that the \"lock keep alive\" feature uses the \"scheduleWithFixedDelay\" to update a DB lock every 30 seconds.  When the PC is resumed, this generates a \"backlog\" of thousands of calls.  It is better to use \"scheduleWithFixedDelay\" instead, which waits until the previous calls has finished before firing a new one.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12607331","id":"12607331","filename":"activemq_jdbc_no_thread_storm.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=metatech","name":"metatech","key":"metatech","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"metatech","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-10-08T07:46:40.819+0000","size":725,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12607331/activemq_jdbc_no_thread_storm.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"352672","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Avoid thread creation storm after machine suspend/resume","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=metatech","name":"metatech","key":"metatech","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"metatech","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=metatech","name":"metatech","key":"metatech","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"metatech","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"ServiceMix 4.4.2","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12672762/comment/13789499","id":"13789499","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"This sort of thing has been fixed in more recent releases.
