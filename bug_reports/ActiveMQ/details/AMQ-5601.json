Server\" JMS module configured pointing to the ActiveMQ's queue\n-- a simple EJB3 MDB hooked up to this queue via XAConnectionFactory.\n\nWhat the MDB does:\nIt's annotated with @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRED), thus enforcing an XA transaction.\nIt calls a method from a @Local EJB, which is annotated with @TransactionAttribute(TransactionAttributeType.REQUIRES_NEW).\nDepending on the JMS message content, it calls mdc.setRollbackOnly() to enforce a rollback.\n\nWhat's happening in the OK case:\n- you place a message to the ActiveMQ queue.\n- the message is picked up by the activemq-client at WebLogic.\n- the MDB is called within an XA transaction.\n- when the @Local bean is called, this XA transaction is suspended (TransactionContext.end() with flags == TMSUSPEND).\n- when the @Local bean returns, the transaction is continued again (TransactionContext.begin() with flags == TMRESUME).\n- finally, end() with flags == TMSUCCESS and commit() is called.\n\nWhat's happening in the Rollback case:\n- the same until the transaction is resumed\n- end() with flags == TMFAIL and rollback() is called.\nBut, what's going wrong is:\n- TransactionContext.beforeEnd() is already called during the end() / TMSUSPEND call, which in my opinion does \"too much\" communication with the broker, because a suspend doesn't necessarily mean that the transaction will be ok in the end.\n- the message stays in the ActiveMQ queue (I have no explanation for that...).\n- there's no redelivery of the message to the MDB, as if the message is somehow \"lost\" somewhere within the activemq-client datastructures.\n- if WebLogic is shut down, then the message is really \"lost\" because it also vanishes from the ActiveMQ queue.\n\nFor our project, I'm going to deploy the attached quick fix, where I just will \"ignore\" the TMSUSPEND / TMRESUME calls to the begin() and end() methods in TransactionContext.\nSo the beforeEnd() method is not called during suspend and in the end every \"ok\" and \"rollback\" scenarios I tested worked perfectly for me.\n\nI would understand if you don't take over this patch to the ActiveMQ code base, because it's in fact \"ignoring\" XA suspend/resume calls completely instead of implementing them properly.\nHowever, I created this issue anyway, because the patch might be of interest for other people. Of course without any guarantees that this \"works for me\" patch also \"works for you\". :-)\n\nBTW:\nIs a proper implementation of XA suspend/resume on any roadmap?\n\nThanks.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12699690","id":"12699690","filename":"xa-suspend-resume-quick-fix.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slash","name":"slash","key":"slash","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Trummer","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Vienna"},"created":"2015-02-19T15:43:22.361+0000","size":1208,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12699690/xa-suspend-resume-quick-fix.diff"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"XA suspend/resume ending in a rollback not working properly (quick-fix attached)","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slash","name":"slash","key":"slash","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Trummer","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Vienna"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slash","name":"slash","key":"slash","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Trummer","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Vienna"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux (Debian squeeze)\nWebLogic Server 10.3.6.0 with a \"Foreign Server\" JMS module pointing to ActiveMQ.\nWebLogic and ActiveMQ running locally.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12776191/comment/14327644","id":"14327644","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slash","name":"slash","key":"slash","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Trummer","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Vienna"},"body":"attached the \"works for me\" quick fix.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=slash","name":"slash","key":"slash","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bernhard Trummer","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Vienna"},"created":"2015-02-19T15:43:22.368+0000","updated":"2015-02-19T15:43:22.368+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5601/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i25tc7:"}}
