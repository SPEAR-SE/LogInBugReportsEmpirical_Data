The issue occurs if a new connection from a client fails for a reason other than a security reason (such as invalid clientId) and then the client doesn't close the socket on their end.  So if the client calls close() on their connection after they get an error or if they shutdown the JVM then the socket would close and it would be fine.  As far as the behavior, you just end up with a bunch of open sockets that won't be closed.  This of course is bad as you can run out of file descriptors, etc.\n\nIf you want to see the behavior in action take a look at the unit test I committed: https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=blob;f=activemq-unit-tests/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/tcp/TcpTransportCloseSocketTest.java;h=ad2080beaea2a21c24a37003cbab6c7a63344aa1;hb=df7aa6e\n\nThis test shows that after the fix there is only 1 socket open instead of 2 because the second connection attempt fails.  If you run this test against an older version such as 5.14.3 then there will be 2 sockets open even though the second connection attempt failed with an InvalidClientIDException because both the broker and client didn't close the socket.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
