Without the changes the IOException from a disconnect is being handled under the covers by failover: which does a resend.\n\nThe fix is to have the app handle that JMS exception which is really a behaviour change. I wonder if there is some middle ground here that will solve the original problem but not change the behaviour and keep those existing failover tests working?\nFixing the test is accepting this new behaviour which may come as a surprise to existing users.\n\nhttps://builds.apache.org/job/ActiveMQ-Java8-All-UnitTests/org.apache.activemq$activemq-unit-tests/633/testReport/","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2017-02-22T14:08:40.195+0000","updated":"2017-02-22T14:08:40.195+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13017249/comment/15883362","id":"15883362","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
