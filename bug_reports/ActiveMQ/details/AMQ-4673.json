I tried to deploy the same application on GlassFish v4 and get this error:\n\nremote failure: Error occurred during deployment: Exception while deploying the app [appname] : The lifecycle method [afterPropertiesSet] must not throw a checked exception. Related annotation information: annotation [@javax.annotation.PostConstruct()] on annotated element [public void org.apache.activemq.camel.component.CamelEndpointLoader.afterPropertiesSet() throws java.lang.Exception] of type [METHOD]. Please see server.log for more details.\nCommand deploy failed.\n\nIt appears that CamelEndpointLoader has a @PostConstruct method that throws an Exception and per the Java EE spec that isn't allowed.  Apparently GlassFish v3 was lenient but v4 is not.\n\nLooking at the code, it is easy to fix.  The afterPropertiesSet method just needs to catch the exceptions from addQueue/addTopic and log them at the end of the method like it does earlier in the method.  If a failure to add these during the method should actually be considered a failure, then something like IllegalStateException or another unchecked exception should be thrown instead.\n\nThis fix has been tested and verified to get past the problem.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12596692","id":"12596692","filename":"CamelEndpointLoader.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schmke","name":"schmke","key":"schmke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2013-08-07T19:13:24.644+0000","size":1888,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12596692/CamelEndpointLoader.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"342770","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Application that uses activemq-camel fails deploying to GlassFish v4","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schmke","name":"schmke","key":"schmke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=schmke","name":"schmke","key":"schmke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Schmidt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Mac OS X, Java 1.7.0_25, GlassFish v4","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12662462/comment/13749008","id":"13749008","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Made changes on trunk to fix this.
