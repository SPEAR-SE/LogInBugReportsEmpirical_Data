Evidently some of the changes to the default configuration from AMQ-1894 got crossed resulting in some undesirable changes including: \n\n* [Revision 812481|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=812481] commented out the {{<systemUsage>}} element entirely. \n* [Revision 812481|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=812481] also set the default {{memoryLimit}} attribute on {{<systemUsage>}} element to 20mb instead of the intended128mb. \n* [Revision 813011|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=813011] added back the {{memoryLimit}} attribute on {{<policyEntry>}} elements that apply to all destiations after this attribute had been removed entirely in the original patch. \n* [Revision 819520|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=819520] added a {{<pendingSubscriberPolicy>}} element to the {{<policyEntry>}} element for all topics. There should be no pendingSubscriberPolicy by default. \n* [Revision 820563|http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=820563] added a {{<pendingQueuePolicy>}} element to the {{<policyEntry>}} element for all queues. There should be no pendingQueuePolicy by default. \n* It also looks like some of the docs got goofed up so I'll fix that, too. \n* There are also three web applications enabled that shouldn't be including camel, demo and fileserver \n** Enabling the camel web application also enables the camel JMX support which just confuses users who notice the camel JMX domain is present \n\nThe original patch for AMQ-1894 removed the {{<destinationPolicy>}} element entirely. At a later time it was agreed that it should be put back in but only to explicitly enable producer flow control. \n\nThis issue is to remedy these items using a new patch.

It is an advanced option that allows producers to block such that the entire queue does not block on the broker side. So it is relevant when blocking is the desired behavior.\n\nI think the default should be to use disk space rather than to block. Blocking should only happen when disk space is exhausted. To enable this, the pending message policy needs to be configured to spool message indexes to disk.\n\nFrom my experience, producer flow control is experienced as \"this broker is getting slower\" where as it should be experienced as the solution to: I have configured a queue limit but I don't want to block all producers, just fast ones.
