Therefore I had to re-implement the selector matching stuff from AbstractSubscription. Another option would have been to pass on some necessary information to the store, but I didn't want to fiddle around with any ActiveMQ architecture issues.\n\nProbably the ActiveMQ architects can find a better and more elegant solution to this problem. Well, at least my JUnit test run now, and my project will hopefully do so, too.\n\n(As an aside, I observed that the hash-index-topic-data_topic___TheNameOfMyTopic file in the Kaha directory grows without paying attention to the maximum file limit.
