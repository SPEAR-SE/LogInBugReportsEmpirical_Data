That defect was since resolved via PROTON-474 for inclusion in Proton 0.8. Now that AMQ-5346 is underway, that means we are using the updated proton-jms code and the workaround must be removed otherwise it causes various issues itself:\n\n- It may set a timestamp value where none existed, which could lead to addition of a creation-time field on outbound AMQP messages, whereas the Properties section of the AMQP message is meant to be immutable.\n- When setting JMSExpiration to 'new timestamp + old expiration', if the expiration was actually based on the absolute-expiry-time field of the incoming AMQP message then the new JMSExpiration value will be incorrect, much higher than actually requested and preventing the messages from expiring for years longer.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12675818","id":"12675818","filename":"0001-AMQ-5403-remove-old-expiration-workaround-it-is-no-l.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gemmellr","name":"gemmellr","key":"gemmellr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10441","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10441","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10441","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10441"},"displayName":"Robbie
