As a result, static subscriptions will be propagated one further hop than their dynamic counterparts.  In the case of a network TTL of 1, the static subscription consumers from existing bridges are unexpectedly propagated to new bridges, while the dynamic subscription consumers are correctly suppressed.\n\nSolution\n========\nThere should be no logical difference between a network consumer created for a static subscription vs. a dynamic subscription.  In either case, the bridge creates a consumer on behalf of the remote broker.  As such, the consumer for a static subscription should have the remote broker in its broker path because it represents a subscription from that remote broker (even if there is no consumer).\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12551495","id":"12551495","filename":"AMQ4148.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stirlingc","name":"stirlingc","key":"stirlingc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stirling
