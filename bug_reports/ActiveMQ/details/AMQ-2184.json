They are never deliverd to a consumer until the broker is rebooted. Strange enough new messages produced into the same queue with those stuck messages are delivered to the consumers as normal. It simply looks like the borker is blind about the stuck messages.\n\nOur system depends on processing every message, so missing even one of them is realy a big problem in production.\n\nEverything seems to be fine: No warnings, errors or even debug logging gives any hint about a problem. \nUnfortunately we can't debug the broker 'cuse it's our production environment. Our Testing envirenment is not capable to reproduce the problem (actually it's only one Machine with a Broker and a signle jaboss running a small number of producers/clients).\n\nOur messaging characteristics show  moderate producers and slow consumers. The count of simultanous messages is moderate (about 300-1000). Actually the producers have hot phases generating bulks of Messages followed by phases of long inactivity. The consumers are slow related to the producers but always keep within an hour or two. We do not experience any memory problems.\n\n\n\nBecause this bug may be related to https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1918, I had a look at the code around the StoreCursors and stumbled apon a strange code fragment called when removing entries.\n\nThe suspicous code is found in org.apache.activemq.broker.region.cursors.AbstractStoreCursor.remove() in 5.1.0, 5.2 .0 and 5.3.0:\n\n    public final synchronized void remove() {\n        size--;\n        if (size==0 && isStarted() && cacheEnabled) {\n            cacheEnabled=true;\n        }\n    }\n\nAs far as i can see, the if statement ist actually a NOP, 'cause it will not modify cacheEnabled in any case.\n\nMaybe this causes some strange effects when using the StoreCursor's derived from this class..\n\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461462","id":"12461462","filename":"NonBrowsableMessaagesJConsole.jpg","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=npfistner","name":"npfistner","key":"npfistner","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Norbert
