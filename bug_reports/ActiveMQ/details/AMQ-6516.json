However, if the store is not empty, the current Usage is not taken into account.\n\n*Scenario*\nStore Limit = 20 Go, disk Size = 25 Go, current Store Usage = 15 Go\n\nWhen restarting ActiveMQ, available disk space is 25 -15 = 10 Go, and the broker automatically resize the store limit from 20 to 10 Go. However, the store is already 15 Go, and thus effectively full (store usage = 150% reported in the console).\n\nStarting logs:\n{noformat}\nWARN | Store limit is 20240 mb (current store usage is 0 mb). The data directory: (...)\\data\\kahaDB only has 12387 mb of usable space. - resetting to maximum available disk space: 12387 mb\n{noformat}\n\nLogs report a current usage of 0 Mb whereas there is more than 10 Go of data in the store. When connecting a debugger to ActiveMQ, I noticed that the current store usage is computed _before_ the persistence adapter is configured (this is done by the post construct in {{XBeanBrokerService#ensureSystemUsageHasStore()}}, and thus always report '0'.\n\nTested on 5.14.1, but the same behavior was already noticed on 5.12.x and 5.13.x versions","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Wrong StoreUsageLimit computed at startup","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lchdev","name":"lchdev","key":"lchdev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Laurent Chiarello","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Luxembourg"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lchdev","name":"lchdev","key":"lchdev","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Laurent Chiarello","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Luxembourg"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6516/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i36omf:"}}
