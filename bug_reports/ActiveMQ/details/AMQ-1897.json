Initially with all three consumers being started and the producer sending messages, the exclusive consumer feature works fine. \nHowever if you kill and restart each consumer in a row, allowing another consumer to take over the exclusive right, you will eventually reach a state where a message that was already consumed by the previous exclusive consumer gets redelivered to the new exclusive consumer that has taken over the work. \nAs consumers are non-transactional, they will autocommit every single message received, so each msgs gets deleted from the jdbc db sequentially. Hence if another exclusive consumer takes over it should only process messages >= the message number of the previous exclusive consumer. However this is not the case.\n\nThis bug is kind of related to
