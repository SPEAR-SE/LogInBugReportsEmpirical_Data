I've attached both the thread dump and the heap dump to this issue (or better: I'll do so :)\n\nThe broker doesn't do anything (also waits on the transport-socket), the queue has a full page-in buffer (100 messages) but obviously fails to do anything with it. If I manually trigger a doDispatch of all pagedIn messages (via the debugger, just a try to revive the thing) it returns doing nothing at all, since all subscriptions are full (s.isFull). I further investigated the issue and was confused to see the prefetchExtension field of the PrefetchSubscription having a value of -1000 (negative!). This explains why it was considered full:\n  dispatched.size() - prefetchExtension >= info.getPrefetchSize()\n  0 - (-1000) >= 1000\nquite nasty.. so even though the dispatched size was zero the client didn't receive any new messages.\nThe only place this value can become negative is inside acknowledge, where it's decremented (prefetchExtension--), all other places do a Math.max(0, X).\n\nSo here's my guess what happened: The client had a full (1000 messages) prefetch buffer when I killed my master. As soon as the slave was done starting they reconnected and started processing the messages in the prefetch and acknowleding them. This gradually decremented the counter into a negative value because the slave never got a chance to increment the prefetchExtension since it didn't action delivery those messages.\n\nPossible solutions:\n- clear the prefetch buffer on a failover\n- just don't allow this value to become smaller than zero (not sure if that covers all bases)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461149","id":"12461149","filename":"AMQ1925Test.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=msiegenthaler","name":"msiegenthaler","key":"msiegenthaler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mario Siegenthaler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-10T14:27:21.566+0000","size":6040,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461149/AMQ1925Test.java"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461130","id":"12461130","filename":"heapdump-1220373534484.hprof","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=msiegenthaler","name":"msiegenthaler","key":"msiegenthaler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mario Siegenthaler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-02T17:39:42.425+0000","size":3322083,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461130/heapdump-1220373534484.hprof"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461246","id":"12461246","filename":"patch-1925-1.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=msiegenthaler","name":"msiegenthaler","key":"msiegenthaler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mario Siegenthaler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-10T17:14:32.154+0000","size":21853,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461246/patch-1925-1.diff"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461245","id":"12461245","filename":"threaddump-1220371256910.tdump","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=msiegenthaler","name":"msiegenthaler","key":"msiegenthaler","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mario Siegenthaler","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-09-02T17:38:51.107+0000","size":10792,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461245/threaddump-1220371256910.tdump"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161739","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JDBC-Master/Slave Failover -

My first guess wasn't completly off spot, although the client clear it's buffers (Session#clearMessagesInProgress) it still has a message in progress namely the one of the current transaction. So when this message gets ack'd during the recover (the transaction is commited there) the PrefetchSubscription#acknowlegde gets confused.\nIt's inAckRange algorithm runs wild because ack.getFirstMessageId==null and the lastMessageId isn't in the dispatch-list (with the \"old\"-master it'd have been the first entry). So what it does is run to the complete dispatch list and ack's everything. This is a very bad move because it in fact deletes every message in the dispatch list permanently (around 100 messages; also from the DB)!!\nIt even shows the message \"Could not correlate acknowledgment with dispatched message\", but only at debug level.\n\nOf course the dispatching gets completey out of sync afterwards, since all the messages in the broker's dispatched-list are now gone... so every single ack afterward clears (aka deletes from the database) the whole dispatched-list (mostly around 100 messages). After some ack's\n\nNote that I only see this happening with transactional consumers, only then I get a transaction-ack-replay that then goes wrong.

list does not get populated in the slave and hence the acks result in errors. \nTo see the problem, check out the log4j logging in activemq-core/target/test.log that results from:\n   mvn test -Dtest=MasterSlaveTempQueueMemoryTest\n\nFor the slave is is fine to let dispatch happen to fill the dispatchList, the actual doDispatch call is gated on isSlave() so the does not actually go to a
