We are testing the spooling functionality after running out of RAM buffer. We modified the existing ProducerTool and ConsumerTool examples that were provided so that we could send messages that are about 80KB in size. We set the memory in the xml config file to 512Mb.\n\nWhen we first run the Producer tool to publish 40, 000 messages, it runs fine and publishes all 40,000 messages. On version 4.1.1, we could only publish out about ~5,000 messages before being blocked.\n\nAfter running the Producer tool, we ran the ConsumerTool to read all the messages in the queue. It successfully read out all 40, 000 messages.\n\nWe then re-ran the Publisher tool to publish 40,000 messsages. However, the publisher would only publish 10 messages and just block.   We assumed then that 10 messages are in the queue. We ran the Consumer but it would retrieve 0 messages. It acted as if there were no messages on the queue. Subsequent attempt to run Publisher would only publish out 10 messages while subsequent attempts to running the Consumer would retreive 0 messages.\n\n\nAny assistance with this would be greatly appreciated. We are in the process of migrating off the Sun MQ producer and are looking at some open source alternatives. With the design of our application, we need functionality analgous to message cursors. Re-designing the application is not an option.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161815","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Producer Blocks even after emptying out queues on v 4.2","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dparekh1","name":"dparekh1","key":"dparekh1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Parekh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dparekh1","name":"dparekh1","key":"dparekh1","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dave Parekh","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"WinXP SP2\nJDK 1.5.0_11\nP4 duo core @2.16GHz\n","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1209/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s23b:"}}
