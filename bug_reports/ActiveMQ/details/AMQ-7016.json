From the thread analysis it looks the deadlock happened during one thread doing reservation of journal file (journal compaction thread), while other was getting the current data file (general data appender).\r\n\r\n*Thread 1 (any of thread that add/remove mesg):*\r\n\r\nThe getCurrentDataFile(int capacity) method, first locks the currentDataFile and then does rotation, if current capacity is not enough. The rotateWriteFile first locks the fileId and then the current file.\r\n\r\nLocks in sequence -> currentDataFile -> dataFileIdlock -> currentDataFile\r\n\r\n*Thread 2:*\r\n\r\nThe reserveDataFile method first locks dataFileIdlock and then currentDataFile. \r\n\r\nLocks in sequence -> dataFileIdlock -> currentDataFile\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nPlease also see the thread dumps attached.\r\n\r\nShouldn't we always first lock the currentDataFile and then dataFildIdLock? Is there a potential reason, why the reserveDataFile and rotateWriteFile first locks fileId and then currentDataFile?\r\n\r\nCan we also consider using read/write locks rather complete object lock?\r\n\r\nPlease let me know if any other details are required.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\n\r\nPrakash Saraf\r\n\r\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12932458","id":"12932458","filename":"amq_deadlock.log","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prakashsaraf7","name":"prakashsaraf7","key":"prakashsaraf7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prakash Saraf","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-07-20T18:03:40.673+0000","size":7450,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12932458/amq_deadlock.log"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Deadlock in KahaDB journal caused during rotation and getting current data file ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prakashsaraf7","name":"prakashsaraf7","key":"prakashsaraf7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prakash Saraf","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=prakashsaraf7","name":"prakashsaraf7","key":"prakashsaraf7","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Prakash Saraf","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Apache AMQ 5.14.0 with Java Spring.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10431","value":"Important","id":"10431"}],"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13173506/comment/16551149","id":"16551149","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
