The broker is set as persistent with amq-store, the xml-configuration-file is attached (in the zip-file).\n\nOne MessageProducer sends 10.000 messages to a queue. The producers runs in its own thread with its own session.\n\nThe queue is set as transacted.\n\nTwo MessageConsumers register on the queue mentioned above, each in its own thread with its own session.\n\nThe Producer and the Consumers share one connection-object.\n\nEvery second one Consumer is called to be canceld (by session.close - a call to consumer.close does not help), its thread is stopped and a new Consumer is created in a new thread with its own session.\n\nWhat happens?\n1 to 10 messages are duplicated delivered from some consumers. So the 'EnqueueCount' is greater than the 'DequeueCount'. E.G. 10.002 messages are recieved, but just 10.000 messages are sent.\n\nI've tried to synchronized by one common-object the creating, closing or commiting in the Consumer with no success.\n\nAttached is a junit-test, which demonstrates the situation.
