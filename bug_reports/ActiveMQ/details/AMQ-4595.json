Can we get it added to http://activemq.apache.org/per-destination-policies.html? \n\nWould the current behavior (when not setting maxAuditDepth) not rather be a bug? From a client's point of view should a queue browser not be used like an ordinary consumer and not require any broker side config changes? \nI am concerned that no ActiveMQ user will think of raising maxAuditDepth in order to browse more than the default 400 messages. This does not seem intuitive.\n\nAnd finally I want to add that you also need to use version 5.9-SNAPSHOT as even the updated test case does not work with 5.8.0.

I'm pretty sure you could get around it by setting a lower memory limit in 5.8 so it doesn't page in so many messages but I didn't try that.  The fix in AMQ-4487 allows the audit settings to be set in the destination policy, previously they were being ignored. \n\nThe problem is that the Message Audit that's don't to prevent the messages that are redispatched when not acked by a closed consumer from getting dropped into a browser a second time since they are read from the pending dispatch message list.  Since this list can grow quite long in this test case it exceeds the audit depth so we get into a loop since the messages in the list don't appear to be duplicates.  Its a flaw in the way Queue Browsers are designed currently.  It wasn't really an issue until we made the change to page in messages for browsers instead of limiting them to a single page.
