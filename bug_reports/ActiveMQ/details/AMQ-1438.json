Actually this should get called on the \nelse if ( command.isBrokerInfo() ) {\n                this.brokerInfo = (BrokerInfo)command;\n                brokerInfoReceived.countDown();\n                this.optimizeAcknowledge &= !this.brokerInfo.isFaultTolerantConfiguration();\n            }\n\nblock of the onCommand method of org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection.\n\nThis is not getting called. \n\nOn investigating and with some help from AMQ IRC , I found that there are two methods in org.apache.activemq.transport.vm.VMTransport. They are given below\n\n    protected void syncOneWay(Object command){\n        final TransportListener tl=peer.transportListener;\n        prePeerSetQueue=peer.prePeerSetQueue;\n        if(tl==null){\n            prePeerSetQueue.add(command);\n        }else{\n            tl.onCommand(command);\n        }\n    }\n    \n    protected void asyncOneWay(Object command) throws IOException{\n        messageQueue=getMessageQueue();\n        try{\n            messageQueue.put(command);\n            wakeup();\n        }catch(final InterruptedException e){\n            log.error(\"messageQueue interupted\",e);\n            throw new IOException(e.getMessage());\n        }\n    }\n\nThe problem here is even when i set async=true for the VMTransport when the command BrokerInfo is sent syncOneWay is called. At that time TransportListener tl=null. So it gets added to prePeerSetQueue. The reason for this happening is that in org.apache.activemq.transport.vm.VMTransportFactory when the below lines are called a brokerInfo is sent as server.connect() is called. The async=true is not yet set resulting in the syncOneWay getting called. Only after that IntrospectionSupport.setProperties(vmtransport,options); is called and async is set to true. Due to this inconsistency the BrokerInfo command gets lost.\n\nVMTransport vmtransport=server.connect();\nIntrospectionSupport.setProperties(vmtransport,options);\n\nI hope I made the issue clear. Can someone verify the patch or make a fix for this.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=manucet","name":"manucet","key":"manucet","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manu T George","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-10-11T10:43:10.302+0000","updated":"2007-10-11T10:43:10.302+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482377/comment/12939386","id":"12939386","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Applied modified version of the patch in rev 640340.
