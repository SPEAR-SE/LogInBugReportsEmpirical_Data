On the other hand, testing shows that exceptions on addBroker() do not prevent the bridges and do not stop the peer from continuing to create a connection.  So, I believe both need to be done.\n\nThese obervations are based on the 5.4.2 code; I do see that addBroker()'s handling has changed on the trunk, so that's why it would be good to have a JUnit that can confirm the results of an exception on addBroker() are as-expected.\n\nChecking getPeerBrokerInfos() is one place to check.  Another is to look for network bridges.  I'll try that approach.\n\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2011-02-17T17:20:47.635+0000","updated":"2011-02-17T17:22:19.546+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496618/comment/12995966","id":"12995966","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"JUnit test which shows the attempt to reject peer broker connections using a BrokerFilter which throws exceptions on addBroker().","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2011-02-17T18:37:34.148+0000","updated":"2011-02-17T18:37:34.148+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12496618/comment/12996048","id":"12996048","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"Full output running against 5.5 trunk snapshot checked out today, 17 Feb 2011; rev: 1071750.\n\nSomething is notably different.
