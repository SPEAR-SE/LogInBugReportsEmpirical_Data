However if one sets up a client connection using the reliable protocol to a one-and-only external/standalone broker that is alive, then dead, then alive, the reliable protocol does not reconnect to it.\n\nThis issue may be directly related to AMQ-211 which is marked as fixed, but this test case still fails for me.\n\nThe really interesting part is line 105 of my test case, that tries to send the 2nd message.  This line actually succeeds, but NOTHING actually happens.  By tracing through, I eventually get to ActiveMQSession, line 1458, where it calls asyncSendPacket(msg). Inside this method, it checks the isTransportOK property (which is false at this point), then does NOTHING, and returns.  \n\nIt is a silent failure.\n\nSteps to Reproduce:\n\n1. Using the 20050407 3.0 snapshot distribution, startup a standalone broker process using the below configuration file:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC  \"-//ACTIVEMQ//DTD//EN\" \"http://activemq.org/dtd/activemq.dtd\">\n<beans>\n\n  <broker>\n    <connector>\n      <tcpServerTransport uri=\"tcp://localhost:61616\"/>\n    </connector>\n<!--\n    <discoveryAgent>\n      <zeroconfDiscovery type=\"_activemq.broker.development.\"/>\n    </discoveryAgent>\n\n    <discoveryNetworkConnector/>\n-->\n\n    <persistence>\n      <cachePersistence>\n        <journalPersistence directory=\"../var/journal\">\n          <jdbcPersistence dataSourceRef=\"derby-ds\"/>\n        </journalPersistence>\n      </cachePersistence>\n    </persistence>\n  </broker>\n\n  <!-- ==================================================================== -->\n  <!-- JDBC DataSource Configurations -->\n  <!-- ==================================================================== -->\n\n  <!-- The Derby Datasource that will be used by the Broker -->\n  <bean id=\"derby-ds\" class=\"org.apache.commons.dbcp.BasicDataSource\" destroy-method=\"close\">\n    <property name=\"driverClassName\">\n      <value>org.apache.derby.jdbc.EmbeddedDriver</value>\n    </property>\n    <property name=\"url\">\n      <!-- Use a URL like 'jdbc:hsqldb:hsql://localhost:9001' if you want to connect to a remote hsqldb -->\n      <value>jdbc:derby:derbydb;create=true</value>\n    </property>\n    <property name=\"username\">\n      <value></value>\n    </property>\n    <property name=\"password\">\n      <value></value>\n    </property>\n    <property name=\"poolPreparedStatements\">\n      <value>true</value>\n    </property>\n  </bean>\n</beans>\n\n2. Run the attached unit test case, stopping & starting the external broker as requested in the log4j output to the console.  This unit test will wait for start/stop, but you'll have to trigger that manually.  I did not wish to try a fully automated test case because that did not represent the use-case we are trying to achieve.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254530","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Reliable protocol + tcp Connector does not reconnect on restarted external broker","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psmith%40apache.org","name":"psmith@apache.org","key":"psmith@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Smith","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psmith%40apache.org","name":"psmith@apache.org","key":"psmith@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Smith","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481066/comment/12936727","id":"12936727","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Should be fixed now.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2005-04-08T09:22:02.000+0000","updated":"2005-04-08T09:22:02.000+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-230/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i17ybj:"}}
