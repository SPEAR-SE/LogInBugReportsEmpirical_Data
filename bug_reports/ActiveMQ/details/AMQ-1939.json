The producer tends to be colocated on the broker's host so \ncomms is never an issue there. However, consumers can come and go because the underlying comms may not be reliable.\nThe consumers are connected with differing priorities so that the broker directs all messages to a single consumer normally and switches over to the \nother consumer when the primary consumer disconnects for whatever reason.\nThis arrangement seems to work fine most of the time, but sometimes (and we cannot identify the cause), upon a comms error\nor a consumer error (that may mean messages are not acknowledged within some time period), the broker switches over to the \nsecondary consumer. That in itself if good, of course. However, when the primary consumer reconnects back to the queue as \nprimary, messages are not being delivered to it at all - the only way to fix this seems to be to restart the broker.\n\nWe cannot even force the broker to drop the connections (we're limited in the way we can use jconsole with those brokers, particularly with the WinNT ones).\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"255171","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"AMQ broker does not honour consumer priority setting on queue","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bonnyr","name":"bonnyr","key":"bonnyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bonny Rais","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bonnyr","name":"bonnyr","key":"bonnyr","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bonny Rais","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"WinXP, SLES9, WinNT4","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482742/comment/12940600","id":"12940600","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Please produce a TEST CASE - can't reproduce this","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-28T23:15:14.560+0000","updated":"2008-12-28T23:15:14.560+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1939/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1829z:"}}
