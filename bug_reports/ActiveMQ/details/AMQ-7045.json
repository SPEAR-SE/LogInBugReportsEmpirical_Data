When a Mobile client lost its connection in some case persistent messages get lost. I observerved this behavoiur with different mqtt clients. Here are two cases to reproduce this bug.\r\nh1. Case 1\r\n\r\nTwo clients: Client A connected over mqtt and Client B connected via jms\r\n # Client A Subscribe to amq topic with Qos 2 and cleanSession = false\r\n # Client B publish Message to topic with persistant flag = true\r\n # Client A receive Message with Qos 0\r\n # Disconnect client A (Turn on Airplanemode on Android)\r\n # same as in step 2\r\n # wait several minutes (longer as keep alive intervall)\r\n # same as step 2\r\n # Connect client A again (Turn off Airplane mode on Android device)\r\n # Client A reiceives only message sent in step 7 with Qos = 0, message from step 5 is lost.\r\n\r\nh1. Case 2\r\n\r\nSee [https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27189086/activemq-lost-persistent-message-sent-to-detached-consumer-before-keepaliveinter/52096122#52096122]\r\nh1. Expected Behavoiur\r\n\r\nMessages with persisant flag = true will sent to mqtt client with qos = 1 or 2 (delivered at least once or exactly once)\r\n\r\nMessages with persistant flag = false will sent to mqtt client with qos = 0 (delivered 0 or 1 time)\r\nh1. Bug\r\n\r\nFor me it seems that in File MQTTProtocolConverter on line 588 the constants QoS.AT_MOST_ONCE and QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE are swapped.\r\n\r\nThe line should look like\r\n\r\n{{qoS = message.isPersistent() ? QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE : QoS.AT_MOST_ONCE ;}} \r\n\r\ninstead of \r\n\r\n{{qoS = message.isPersistent() ? QoS.AT_MOST_ONCE : QoS.AT_LEAST_ONCE;}}\r\n\r\nA nice feature is when the user can change the mapping between Qos and Persistant Flag in the configuration file. \r\n\r\n[https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=blob;f=activemq-mqtt/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/transport/mqtt/MQTTProtocolConverter.java;h=ff6ee4335a4d27d665d4012f3b85c0ea3b31cfc2;hb=HEAD]\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\n ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Lost messages when send from amq to mqtt client","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=da4id","name":"da4id","key":"da4id","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Z.","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=da4id","name":"da4id","key":"da4id","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Z.","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"h1.  ","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-7045/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3xlfz:"}}
