We have a queue where, at the moment, there is only one consumer, who is set up to consume only 'S' messages.  We've tested\nthis with two scenarios: \n1)       Place an 'N' message in the queue, followed by an 'S'.  No\npriority is assigned to the messages.  The consumer is able to receive\nthe 'S' message, even though the 'N' message is ahead of it in the\nqueue.  This is the behavior that we find logical.\n\n2)       Place an 'N' message in the queue with a priority of 4,\n followed by an 'S' with a priority of 2.  Only difference from\nscenario 1 is that priorities have been assigned to messages.  Now the\nconsumer cannot receive any messages Â¡V it blocks until we add a\nconsumer that consumes the 'N' type message.  This behavior seems to be a bug. \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161892","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"High priority message blocks low priority message being consumed by consumers, who is only interested in the message that happen to have low prority","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=activemq_jira","name":"activemq_jira","key":"activemq_jira","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Frank","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=activemq_jira","name":"activemq_jira","key":"activemq_jira","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Frank","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Window, Java1.5, ActiveMQ3.1M6","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481572/comment/12937375","id":"12937375","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This should now be fixed in 4.x.
