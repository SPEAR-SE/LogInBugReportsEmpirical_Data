After processing it does a 2 phase commit. \n- The connection is lost right after prepare is sent. The failover now reconnects and replays these messages and sends a commit later.\n\n- After the connection is lost AMQ sends the same message to the other client due to the connection loss (most likely because the prepare did not arrive). This client creates another transaction, processes and acknowledges the message. The transaction is now prepared and commit.\n\nThe problem is that the same message is processed in two clients succesfully. Both were able to acknowledge the message in two different transactions. I'd expect that just one (the first?) prepare that arrives at the server is succesful. The other must fail so that all the work done on that client (e.g. DB modifications and sent messages) is reverted by this second transaction.\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"358478","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Message can be acknowledged succesfully it two different transactions","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=remogloor","name":"remogloor","key":"remogloor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Remo Gloor","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=remogloor","name":"remogloor","key":"remogloor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Remo Gloor","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-4878/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1pqwn:"}}
