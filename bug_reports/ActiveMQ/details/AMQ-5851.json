Shannon","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"[~gtully] and [~tabish121],\n\nSorry in advance for the long message but this is a kind of complicated issue and was pretty hard to track down.\n\nThere is a race condition of sorts and it is caused by the unique circumstances of this test case and the environment.  The short version is that message acks are being received out of order due to messages being handled concurrently in different threads.  Sometimes this causes an exception because by the time some of the acks are received by the broker, the broker has already expired the messages so the acknowledgement check fails.  This is happening in Wildfly because the container is creating a pool of threads to handle multiple messages at the same time (ie ServerSession pool).  This is unique to application servers because of the use of a ConnectionConsumer and ServerSessions so multiple threads can handle messages from 1 consumer.\n\nWhat's going on is as a message producer is sending messages to the broker with a TTL value set at 10 milliseconds, the Wildfly consumer is quickly dequeing messages in parallel.  The run() method in ActiveMQSession is being executed for each new message in different threads.  The first thing that happens is the message is checked to see if it has expired (around line 885 of ActiveMQSession).  If it's not expired, then the code continues on and the messageListener (in this case the MDB) eventually runs (around line 1037). The example that was submitted here has the MDB sleeping for 1 second which is  longer than the TTL of the messages being sent.  So a bunch of threads are sleeping for 1 second and then when they are finished the run() method continues on and at the end sends a normal acknowledgement back to the broker in the finally block (around line 1052)\n\nHowever, as the ConnectionConsumer is rapidly consuming more messages and dispatching to different Sessions, eventually one of the threads runs into a message that is expired because the time out period is so short.  Since the message is expired, it is acked early and sent to the broker.  The MDB never fires when the message is expired.   This triggers the broker to iterate through all of the dispatched messages and to expire ones that it can.  This happens in the PrefetchSubscription class around line 325 when an expired Ack is received.  So, all of the messages that were dispatched essentially get removed from that dispatch list since all of the messages are expired.  Then, when some of the threads in Wildfly finish sleeping they continue on and get around to sending back an ack.  Except that by the time this acknowledgement is sent to the broker, the messages have already been expired because the thread that detected the expired message already sent an expired ack to the broker so the message attempting to be acked doesn't exist in the dispatched list.\n\nBelow is a printout from my log file with some extra debug statements that I added.  The \"handling message\" line is a debug statement that I added to print right after a message is dequeued in the run() method.  You can see multiple threads executing at the same time in Wildfly.  \"Expired Message\" prints out when a message is detected as being expired. \"Sending Ack\" prints out when the thread finishes the normal execution and sends a normal ack back to the broker.  As you can see below, we run into trouble when the thread handling the 4th message finishes and sends an acknowledgement to the broker.  During the period of time that the thread handling message 4 was sleeping for 1 second, 13 other messages were handled in parallel.  Just before thread 4 finished, one of the other threads had detected that message 13 expired and sent back an expiration ack which triggered all of the acks to be expired(including message 4) so by the time the ack for the 4th message reached the broker that message was already removed from the dispatch list and we get an exception.\n\nSo, as far as solutions go, I'm not sure what the best approach would be.  This situation could happen anytime messages are processed slowly in parallel and there is a TTL set.  Obviously one work around is to not concurrently process messages off the same subscription but that is pretty common with MDBs and application servers.  One solution could be to check a second time to see if the message has expired after the messageListener has been called and send an expired ack instead of a normal ack in that case.  But we'd need to change the server logic to not fail if it couldn't find the message to ack because it was already expired.  I think another solution could be to keep track of of which messages have already been expired on a subscription for some window of time so that so that if an acknowledgement comes later it could be detected as being for an expired message and no error would be thrown.  What do you guys thing?  I can work on a PR and introduce a fix but wanted to discuss what you thought would be the best approach.\n\n{noformat}\n20:20:52,347 INFO  [org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQEndpointWorker] (default-threads - 1) Successfully established connection to broker [tcp://localhost:61616]\n20:21:00,745 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 2) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:3:1\n20:21:00,747 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 2) Expired Ack (ActiveMQSession) for: null,ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:3:1\n20:21:00,763 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 3) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1\n20:21:00,868 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 4) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:5:1\n20:21:00,980 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 5) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:6:1\n20:21:01,087 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 6) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:7:1\n20:21:01,199 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 7) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:8:1\n20:21:01,315 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 8) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:9:1\n20:21:01,316 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 8) Expired Ack (ActiveMQSession) for: null,ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:9:1\n20:21:01,423 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 9) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:10:1\n20:21:01,539 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 10) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:11:1\n20:21:01,655 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 11) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:12:1\n20:21:01,768 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 12) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:13:1\n20:21:01,806 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 12) Expired Ack (ActiveMQSession) for: null,ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:13:1\n20:21:01,809 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 3) Hello world!3\n20:21:01,810 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 3) Sending Ack (ActiveMQSession line 1010) for: 2; ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1,ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1\n20:21:01,872 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 4) Hello world!4\n20:21:01,872 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 4) Sending Ack (ActiveMQSession line 1010) for: 2; ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:5:1,ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:5:1\n20:21:01,874 INFO  [stdout] (default-threads - 13) handling message: ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:14:1\n20:21:01,888 ERROR [org.apache.activemq.ra.ActiveMQEndpointWorker] (ActiveMQ Connection Executor: tcp://localhost/127.0.0.1:61616@43165) Connection to broker failed: Unmatched acknowledge: MessageAck {commandId = 16, responseRequired = false, ackType = 2, consumerId = ID:localhost.localdomain-46056-1434846051491-1:1:-1:2, firstMessageId = ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1, lastMessageId = ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1, destination = queue://TEST.FOO, transactionId = null, messageCount = 1, poisonCause = null}; Could not find Message-ID ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1 in dispatched-list (start of ack): javax.jms.JMSException: Unmatched acknowledge: MessageAck {commandId = 16, responseRequired = false, ackType = 2, consumerId = ID:localhost.localdomain-46056-1434846051491-1:1:-1:2, firstMessageId = ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1, lastMessageId = ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1, destination = queue://TEST.FOO, transactionId = null, messageCount = 1, poisonCause = null}; Could not find Message-ID ID:localhost.localdomain-53475-1434846046033-2:1:1:4:1 in dispatched-list (start of ack)\n{noformat}\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.

A good trick is to poke around the git annotations in the code you are changing to find relevant commits and corresponding tests.
