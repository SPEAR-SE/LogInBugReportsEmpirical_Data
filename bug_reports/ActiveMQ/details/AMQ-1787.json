If too may messages are sent to this queue, and they eventually expire (setting the TTL) before the consumer comes back online, then once the consumer does come online, I see many of the following messages printed to the broker console.\n\n{quote}Failed to fire message expired advisory{quote}\n\nOnce this happens, it seems that no more messages go to any queues, not just the queue whose consumer was down for a while.  I've looked at the web console, both before and after this occurs, and the message counts for all queues stop.  It appears that the broker just gets hung.  I have to kill the broker, and wipe out the data storage in order to get back to a working state.\n\nI've tried various memory settings, with the same result.  My TTL was fairly low (60 seconds), as I was testing out the ability to expire messages.  The number of messages in the queue that were expired were in the 1000+ range.  With a low number of expired messages (< 100), there was no problem.\n\nAs a work around, I can disable sending of the advisory messages, and turn off processing of expired messages, but this is not ideal.\n\n{code:xml}\n<beans>\n  ....\n  <broker  ...  advisorySupport=\"false\">\n    <destinationPolicy>\n        <policyMap>\n            <policyEntries>\n                <policyEntry queue=\">\">\n                    <deadLetterStrategy>\n                        <sharedDeadLetterStrategy processExpired=\"false\"/>\n                    </deadLetterStrategy>\n                </policyEntry>\n                ...\n            </policyEntries>\n        </policyMap>\n    </destinationPolicy>\n    ...\n  </broker>\n</beans>\n{code}","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"159786","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Too many expired queue messages on intermittent consumer causes ActiveMQ to hang","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=briandesai","name":"briandesai","key":"briandesai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brian Desai","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=briandesai","name":"briandesai","key":"briandesai","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brian Desai","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux\nSun JDK 1.6.0","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483434/comment/12939771","id":"12939771","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The same underlying problem as was fixed for https://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-1774","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-06-11T10:18:20.224+0000","updated":"2008-06-11T10:18:20.224+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483434/comment/12942405","id":"12942405","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dongpak","name":"dongpak","key":"dongpak","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dong Pak","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"With a producer producing object messages with message expiration set to 5 seconds, we are seeing no messages sent to consumer when messages start to expire and put into DLQ.
