credentials are listed in credentials.properties.\n\nYou can reproduce this issue with the following steps:\n# Install a fresh copy of ActiveMQ 5.10.0\n# Enable security by adding the following plugin configuration to conf/activemq.xml:\n{noformat}\n<broker>\n...\n<plugins>\n    <simpleAuthenticationPlugin>\n            <users>\n                <authenticationUser username=\"system\" password=\"${activemq.password}\"\n                    groups=\"users,admins\"/>\n                <authenticationUser username=\"user\" password=\"${guest.password}\"\n                    groups=\"users\"/>\n                <authenticationUser username=\"guest\" password=\"${guest.password}\" groups=\"guests\"/>\n            </users>\n        </simpleAuthenticationPlugin>\n</plugins>\n{noformat}\n# Start ActiveMQ\n# Open http://0.0.0.0:8161/admin/queues.jsp with a browser and login with admin/admin\n# Create a new queue and try to send a message\n\nThe result is that the message is not sent and the following exception appears:\n{noformat}\n INFO | ActiveMQ WebConsole available at http://0.0.0.0:8161/\n INFO | Initializing Spring FrameworkServlet 'dispatcher'\n INFO | jolokia-agent: No access restrictor found at classpath:/jolokia-access.xml, access to all MBeans is allowed\n INFO | Connector vm://localhost started\n WARN |

org.apache.activemq.security.SimpleAuthenticationBroker.addConnection(SimpleAuthenticationBroker.java:85)[activemq-broker-5.10.0.jar:5.10.0]\n{noformat}\n\nThe problem seems to be that the web client is authenticating using the credentials from the http request instead of the credentials from conf/credentials.properties. It seems to me that this is incorrect because the header of the file says:\n\n{noformat}\n# Defines credentials that will be used by components (like web console) to access the broker\n{noformat}\n\nFrom the source code of WebClient.java this behavior might have been introduced in #AMQ-3924.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Unable to send message from web console when using secured broker","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sihaya","name":"sihaya","key":"sihaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bob","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sihaya","name":"sihaya","key":"sihaya","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bob","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12762675/comment/15487186","id":"15487186","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=afharo","name":"afharo","key":"afharo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Fernandez Haro","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This issue still happens in version 5.13.3","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=afharo","name":"afharo","key":"afharo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alejandro Fernandez Haro","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-09-13T13:22:23.842+0000","updated":"2016-09-13T13:22:23.842+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5494/votes","votes":2,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i23lc7:"}}
