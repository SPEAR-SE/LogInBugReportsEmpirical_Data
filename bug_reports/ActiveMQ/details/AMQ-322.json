I profiled the MessageBroker using Yourkit, then ran the producer and consumer - the memory leak was pretty clear in ActiveMQ3.1 *until* I added the line:\n\npublisher.setDeliveryMode(DeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT);\n\nto the producer.  With the above line included there is no leak, so I think the fault was in my usage of ActiveMQ, rather than ActiveMQ itself.  \n\ncheers,\nSteve.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steveliles","name":"steveliles","key":"steveliles","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"steve liles","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2005-09-15T12:03:02.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-15T12:03:02.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481253/comment/12936687","id":"12936687","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steveliles","name":"steveliles","key":"steveliles","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"steve liles","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"sorry, i should have said that the test project i attached currently has the NON_PERSISTENT line in the producer, so it shouldn't leak ... comment out that line to see the leak ;)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steveliles","name":"steveliles","key":"steveliles","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"steve liles","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2005-09-15T12:06:30.000+0000","updated":"2005-09-15T12:06:30.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481253/comment/12936744","id":"12936744","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=leochan","name":"leochan","key":"leochan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Leo Chan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I have download 3.1 Production release and test again by same environment as before.
