I'm not sure if it's an issue with the libzip.so in the JRE/JDK that you're using or a problem with the JAR file from which the class is being loaded. First, I'd try to install a new copy of the JRE/JDK (from a fresh download of it) to check that it's not the libzip.so. If the JVM still crashes, then I'd try grabbing a fresh copy of the ActiveMQ libraries. It's possible that something was damaged during a download. \n\nFWIW, when I encounter oddities like this with JAR files, I tend to use the {{jar}} utility to get a table of contents on the JARs as a test of those JARs.
