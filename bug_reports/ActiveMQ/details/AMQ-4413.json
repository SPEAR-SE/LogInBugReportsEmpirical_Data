From the log observation, it seems that the internal states of the store cursor (i.e. AbstractStoreCursor) is not well guarded by race condition between message sending/directly-dispatching-pending thread (from publisher) and subscription deactivating thread (from subscriber's closing), especially when subscriber's closing (javax.jms.MessageConsumer#close) and message publishing happen simultaneously.\n\nObservations and the test scenario are described at below in detail:\nhttp://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/persistent-message-missing-to-a-durable-subscriber-when-it-reconnects-restarts-td4665130.html\n\nAttached please find Test.java that I used to verify this issue.  I found the issue initially with activemq-core-5.7.0.jar then confirmed that it's reproducible with other upper versions (i.e. apache-activemq-5.8-SNAPSHOT, apache-activemq-5.9-SNAPSHOT).\n\nThis \"message loss\" issue is pretty critical as it can happen whenever durable subscriber reconnects either purposely or unexpectedly, and it could be violating the one of primitive features that messaging platform guarantees: \"no message loss\",  if happens, whereas it's so easy to reproduce the
