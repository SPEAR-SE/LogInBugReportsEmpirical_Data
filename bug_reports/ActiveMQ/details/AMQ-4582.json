IntrospectionSupport.setProperty catches the exception and returns false.\n\nI believe that this code should not be ignoring exceptions like this.

Yeah, I removed the changes to TcpTransportServer.java from my latest patch (see the comments of AMQ-4433) because of the test failures. IIRC, the problem is that other non-transport parameters enter that code path and mess things up. I gave up on validating the transport parameters because it seemed like too much work for me, sorry. I hope you know the codebase better and can sort things out!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=qerub","name":"qerub","key":"qerub","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Christoffer Sawicki","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-07-24T09:49:03.949+0000","updated":"2013-07-24T09:49:03.949+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12652700/comment/13733940","id":"13733940","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"I've patched the problem in the code for now by treating this option as a special case just to ensure we don't start up with all suites enabled as that's just not good.
