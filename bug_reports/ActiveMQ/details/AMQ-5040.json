When a connection breaks to the broker, for example a WiFi connection breaks, and the phone reconnects via mobile network, the MqttService retries connecting to the broker. The client responds with \"Broker unavailable (3)\", and in the broker console the same \"already connected\" message appears as with the original post.\n\nThe same issue is when the WiFi is turned off, then on. Every reconnect actually results in the same error. \n\nThe code is more or less identical.\n\n-------------------------------------\nI built client that is connecting to Apache MQ set for mqtt. \n\nNow on first try client establishes the connection with client id = test1, sends message and closes connection\n\n         if(!client.isConnected()){\n\t\t\tclient.connect(conOpt);\n        }\n        MqttTopic topic = client.getTopic(topicName);\n\n        MqttMessage message = new MqttMessage(payload);\n    \tmessage.setQos(qos);\n    \tMqttDeliveryToken token = topic.publish(message);\n    \ttoken.waitForCompletion();\n    \tclient.disconnect();\n\n\nThen when again I run client it fails on connect ...
