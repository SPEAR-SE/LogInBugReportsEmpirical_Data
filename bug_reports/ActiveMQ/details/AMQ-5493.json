It could even happen that it is revived multiple times before the closing process is completed.\n\nTo show the flow of the race condition, consider the following blocks of code from activemq/activemq-kahadb-store/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/store/kahadb/MessageDatabase.java:\n\nLines 425 - 442 [in close()]\n\nif( opened.compareAndSet(true, false)) {\n     ... some code ...\n          if (metadata.page != null) {\n               checkpointUpdate(true);\n          }\n     ... some code ...\n}\n\nLines 1499 - 1501 [in checkpointUpdate(boolean)]\n\npublic void execute(Transaction tx) throws IOException {\n     checkpointUpdate(tx, cleanup);\n}\n\nLine 1524 [in checkpointUpdate(Transaction, boolean)]\n\nmetadata.ackMessageFileMapLocation = checkpointAckMessageFileMap();\n\nLine 1735 [in checkpointAckMessageFileMap()]\n\nLocation location = store(new KahaAckMessageFileMapCommand().setAckMessageFileMap(new Buffer(baos.toByteArray())), nullCompletionCallback);\n\nLines 993 - 995 [in store(...)]\n\nif (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive()) {\n     startCheckpoint();\n}\n\nLines 332  - 372  [In startCheckpoint()]\nif (checkpointThread == null) {\n     start = true;\n} else if (!checkpointThread.isAlive()) {\n     start = true;\n      LOG.info(\"KahaDB: Recovering checkpoint thread after death\");\n}\n\nif (start) {\n     checkpointThread = new Thread(\"ActiveMQ Journal Checkpoint Worker\") {\n          @Override\n          public void run() {\n               try {\n                     ... some code ...\n                     while (opened.get()) {\n                          ... some code ...\n                     }\n                } catch (InterruptedException e) {\n                            // Looks like someone really wants us to exit this thread...\n                } catch (IOException ioe) {\n                            LOG.error(\"Checkpoint failed\", ioe);\n                            brokerService.handleIOException(ioe);\n               }\n          }\n     };\n\n     checkpointThread.setDaemon(true);\n     checkpointThread.start();\n}\n\nHere is the sequence of events, involving code above that shows the race:\n\n1. in close() set \"opened\" to false\n2. in startCheckpoint() \"opened.get()\" is false so checkpoint thread exits run method and makes checkpointThread.isAlive() false\n3. in store(...) calling startCheckpoint() which will revive the checkpoint thread again\n\nAdded some INFO logs to confirm the order above:\n\n2014-12-17 13:27:43,678 | INFO  | patanasov: from unload() calling close() | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18\n2014-12-17 13:27:43,678 | INFO  | patanasov: close(): set opened to false; calling checkpointUpdate(true) | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18\n2014-12-17 13:27:43,678 | INFO  | patanasov: startCheckpoint(): checkpointThread exiting its run method | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | ActiveMQ Journal Checkpoint Worker\n2014-12-17 13:27:43,681 | INFO  | patanasov: from store() calling startCheckpoint() | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18\n2014-12-17 13:27:43,682 | INFO  | KahaDB: Recovering checkpoint thread after death | org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase | Thread-18\n\nBased on my limited understanding of this code, this does not seem to have any serious negative impacts, but it would be nice to be looked at by the community.   \n\nIt does not seem to make sense to revive the thread after opened.get() became false because the checkpointThread will not do anything anyway due to opened.get() being false at that point. Consider the body of the checkpointThread:\n\nMessageDatabase.java, Lines 348 - 359\n\nwhile (opened.get()){\n     ... code that will attempt updates ...\n}\n\nHowever, since opened.get() is false, this will not enter the while loop and hence the checkpointThread will exit its run quickly again.\n\nA possible fix for this is the following\n\nLines 993 - 995 [in store(...)]\n\nchange\n\nif (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive()) {\n     startCheckpoint();\n}\n\nto\n\nif (checkpointThread != null && !checkpointThread.isAlive() && opened.get()) {\n     startCheckpoint();\n}\n\nIf opened.get() is false, then we must be closing and we will not revive the thread.
