Using the Visual Studio debugger, it appears that the client is waiting on a \"read\" from the socket. The side effect of this is that after a few more seconds, the publisher itself stops to emit messages as if some internal queue becomes full or someting.\n\nI'm fully aware that Openwire is always in a development process but I want to point out that this issue already existed in the previous versions I had tested.
