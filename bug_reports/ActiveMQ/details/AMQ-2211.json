When ''introduced'' into a web container in our case, you start relying on the sequence of how JARs are loaded. In our case, this {{log4j.properties}} unfortunately initialized log4j in such a way that our project logging settings never were applied, as the ones from activeio-core had been picked up before. And that made it hard for us - during a functional testing period - to diagnose problems we had as we lost parts of our logging messages.\n\nPersonally, I consider this to be reason enough to ship a new Maven release that fixes this, especially as the fix is easy to apply.
