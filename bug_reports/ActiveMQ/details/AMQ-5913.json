We have a wrapper script that sets up some environment variables before launching ActiveMQ, including setting ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH to allow our SSL classes to find and load our keystores.  Although we are running on Linux, I found that I needed to set the ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH using Windows-style class pathSeparator.  That is: \n\nACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH=\"$MYHOME;$MYHOME/classes;$MYHOME/classes/mycompany.jar\"; export ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH \n\nInstead of: \nACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH=\"$MYHOME:$MYHOME/classes:$MYHOME/classes/mycompany.jar\"; export ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH \n\nIf I used the Unix-style pathSeparator, then ActiveMQ would fail to start because it could not find my classes in mycompany.jar file, but with the Windows-style pathSeparator, it works, even though it is running on Linux! \n\nFlash forward to today when I am experimenting with ActiveMQ 5.11.1 upgrade.  Suddenly the broker won't start because it can't find my properties files that are in the classpath.  I traced it back to this change in the 'bin/activemq' script in the distribution. \n\nActiveMQ 5.8.0 implementation (in fact this is true thru 5.10.2): \nACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH=\"${ACTIVEMQ_CONF};${ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH}\" \n\nNotice the Windows-style pathSeparator.  This works perfectly. \n\nHowever, beginning with ActiveMQ 5.11.0, the above line looks like: \n\nACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH=\"${ACTIVEMQ_CONF}:${ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH}\" \n\nHere it has been \"fixed\" to use the Unix-style separator, but this actually breaks it!  If I change this one thing back to \";\", then all is well again. \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ACTIVEMQ_CLASSPATH requires Windows-style path separator on Unix","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=agrabil","name":"agrabil","key":"agrabil","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Greg Rabil","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=agrabil","name":"agrabil","key":"agrabil","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Greg Rabil","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12851100/comment/15122321","id":"15122321","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
