The commit is really commit what succeeded, not what failed, or commit the transaction, whatever is in there.\nIn the async case, it is more problematic b/c the client can be unaware that all messages are resulting in exceptions. The difficulty is tying the exception listener to the session, at the moment it is tied to the connection, so there can be more than one session context and more than one transaction. It would be possible to flag all transactions as 'toRollback' but that sounds two harsh.
