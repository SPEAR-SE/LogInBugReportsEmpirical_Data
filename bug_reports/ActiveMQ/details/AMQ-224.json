I am using the latest ActiveMQ 2.1 with JDK 1.5. I have two networked-broker with network channels, let's say A, B. If I shutdown broker B, the network channel on both ends re-connected. But i noticed that the topic publisher in B is no longer able to publish message to A. On the other hand, topic subscriber is able to receive the message published by A. If I shutdown A, the situation is reversed. \n\nI like to confirm whether this finding is valid. I appreciate you input. \n\nThanks \n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254516","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"not able to publish message after broker shutdown-restart in network-brokers","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fanhong","name":"fanhong","key":"fanhong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Fan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fanhong","name":"fanhong","key":"fanhong","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Hong Fan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"active 2.1, jdk 1.5 window xp","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481120/comment/12936664","id":"12936664","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Hi, I was not able to reproduce your scenario with the 3.1-M4 release.
