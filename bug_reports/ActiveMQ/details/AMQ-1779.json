However, the monitor on connectWork may be lost when the connectWork is re-scheduled after an unsuccessful attempt, making it possible that the getConnection() method gets the monitor and returns null instead of the re-established connection.\n- The code for registering a ConnectionConsumer on the ActiveMQConnection leads to a deadlock if there are some messages left to be delivered from before the broker has failed. In that case, the ServerSessionPoolImpl.createServerSessionImpl() method will be triggered by the next message delivery. However, the createServerSessionImpl() method needs to wait for the EndpointWorker.getConnection() method to return which is also synchronized on the connectWork that is trying to register the ConnectionConsumer. The problem here is that the constructor of the ActiveMQConnectionConsumer uses syncSendPacket() instead of asyncSendPacket() in order to register the consumer with the broker. Thus the instantiation of the ActiveMQConnectionConsumer blocks until the first message has been delivered, leading to the deadlock.\n\nKai","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudalla","name":"hudalla","key":"hudalla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Hudalla","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-06-06T14:15:33.031+0000","updated":"2008-06-06T14:16:37.610+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482440/comment/12939698","id":"12939698","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudalla","name":"hudalla","key":"hudalla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Hudalla","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I have changed the connectWork to loop until it finally gets a connection to the broker instead of re-scheduling itself after a failed connection attempt.
