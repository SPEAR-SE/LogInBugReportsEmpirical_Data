Looks like PooledSession.getTopicPublisher() is responsible for creating the publisher from the contained ActiveMQSession, but does not supply a destination (explicitly passes null).\n\nSample code to recreate issue (also attached is Junit test case):\n\t\tActiveMQTopic topic = new ActiveMQTopic(\"test\");\n\t\tPooledConnectionFactory pcf = new PooledConnectionFactory();\n\t\tpcf.setConnectionFactory(new ActiveMQConnectionFactory(\"vm://test\"));\n\n\t\tTopicConnection conn = (TopicConnection)pcf.createConnection();\n\t\tTopicSession session = conn.createTopicSession(false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE);\n\t\tTopicPublisher publisher = session.createPublisher(topic);\n\t\tpublisher.publish(session.createMessage());\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460818","id":"12460818","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--PooledTopicPublisherTest.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alewando","name":"alewando","key":"alewando","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adam Lewandowski","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2007-02-12T16:09:40.799+0000","size":919,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460818/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--PooledTopicPublisherTest.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161938","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"PooledConnectionFactory / PooledSession generates UnsupportedOperationException when publishing to a topic","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alewando","name":"alewando","key":"alewando","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adam Lewandowski","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alewando","name":"alewando","key":"alewando","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adam Lewandowski","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1161/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s2un:"}}
