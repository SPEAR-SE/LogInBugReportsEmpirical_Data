expecting to see messages in the DLQ after max 6 redeliveries and max 2430000 msecs. But sometimes this rule is violated and I can see messages in the DLQ with redeliveryDelay=90000, 270000. What is more strange, that there is messages in the DLQ with redeliveryDelay=9000, which is not multiply of configured 10000. \n\nSubscription mode for consumer is default (not specified). Logic of consumer is pretty simple: take one message, process it and then say \"ack\" or \"nack\" in the case of exceptions or fatal errors during handling. \n\nSo, the questions is: why does the broker can move messages to the DLQ too early without respecting the configured number of redeliveries and timeout between redelivery?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Message is moved to DLQ too early after several redeliveres","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lisachenko","name":"lisachenko","key":"lisachenko","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Lisachenko","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Moscow"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lisachenko","name":"lisachenko","key":"lisachenko","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alexander Lisachenko","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Moscow"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5759/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2e8iv:"}}
