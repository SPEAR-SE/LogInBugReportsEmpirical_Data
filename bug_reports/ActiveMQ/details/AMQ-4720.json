of problem:\n-------------------\nIf a static failover network connector is setup to connect to 2 other brokers & to fail-back to a priority broker; messages can be lost after fail-back because the remote broker deletes them due to duplicate producer-sequence numbers even though the producer-id has changed.\nMy suspicion is that the remote broker doesn't recognise that the re-established connection is a network connection & so doesn't check producer-id.\n\n\nTest-harness setup:\n-------------------\nUsing ActiveMQ 5.8.0 binary download.\nOnly changes are to logging settings & to the configuration file.\n\n3 brokers (\"amq1\", \"amq2\", \"amq3\"), all brokers running on localhost.\nEach uses their own config file (amq1.xml, amq2.xml, amq3.xml)\n\nBroker amq1 has a failover duplex connection to amq2.\nBroker amq3 has a duplex failover connection to both amq1 + amq2, it is configured to always try to connect to amq1 first (\"randomize=false\") and to fail-back to amq1 if it comes back online (\"priorityBackup=true\")\n\nConsumer connects to broker amq1\nProducer connects to broker amq3\n\nTest-harness sender application creates a new session each time it is run & sends a set of messages.\nThe sending session is not transacted & is set to auto-acknowledge.\nMessages are sent with persistent delivery mode.\nMessages are on queue \"MyQueue\"\n\n\nTest script:\n------------\nStart all 3 brokers.\nBroker amq3 establishes a connection to amq1.\nBroker amq1 establishes a connection to amq2.\n\nConsumer connects to amq2 & starts consuming queue \"MyQueue\".\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed on to broker amq1 which forwards them to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer.\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all delivered as before - N.B. producerID is different as this is a new connection.\n\nBroker amq1 is shut down.\nBroker amq3 fails-over to connect to amq2.\n\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed directly to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer - (as before, the producer-id has changed).\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are delivered as before.\n\nBroker amq1 is restarted \nBroker amq1 re-establishes its connection to amq2.\n\nBroker amq3 notices that amq1 is available & fails-back to it.\n    - Broker amq3 closes its connection to amq2\n    - Broker amq3 starts a new connection to amq1\n\nProducer connects to amq3 & sends 10 messages on queue \"MyQueue\" - these are all passed directly to amq2 where they are delivered to the consumer - (as before, the producer-id has changed).\n    - N.B. Immediately before the first message is received & forwarded by amq1, amq1's log shows:\n        2013-09-11 12:05:56,639 | DEBUG | last stored sequence id set: -1 |

to amq2, where they are consumed.\n\n\nIt looks to me as if amq1 doesn't realise that the fail-back network connection established by amq3 is a network connection & so isn't checking producer IDs.\n\n\n\n\nDetails of why I'm trying this configuration:\n---------------------------------------------\n\nUse case:\n---------\n1 central site.\nMultiple branches, each with a single branch server and multiple user PCs.\nEach branch only has 1 internet connection that is shared by branch server & PCs.\nBranch server is typically unreliable hardware & may go offline without notice.\nResilience to network loss is important & so each PC & server has its own broker.\nBoth branch server & PCs need to be able to communicate with the centre\n\nTo reduce the number of connections into the centre, we would like a tree topology with the branch server concentrating all branch PC messages & forwarding them to the centre.\nBut, PCs generate a data feed that we want to be able to access at centre, even when the branch server is offline.\n\nProposed configuration:\n-----------------------\nUse a failover network connection on branch PCs & configure the connection to prioritise a connection to the branch server, but open a direct connection to the centre if the branch server is unavailable.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12602569","id":"12602569","filename":"amq1.log","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andymay","name":"andymay","key":"andymay","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andrew
