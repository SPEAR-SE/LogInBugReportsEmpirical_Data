Everything works fine when consumer application is restarted.\n\nI have set maxInactivityDuration to 0. \n\nI have also set handlers for ConnectionInterruptedListener, ConnectionResumedListener and ExceptionListener but no events are fired. \n\nAfter I close consumer application ACTIVEMQ console does report one consumer less. \n\nHere is transport connector configuration element in activemq.xml: \n\n  <transportConnector name=\"openwire\" \nuri=\"tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=0&keepAlive=true\" discoveryUri=\"multicast://default\"/> \n\n\nand client connects by using following uri: \n\n\"failover:(tcp://somehost:61616?wireFormat.maxInactivityDuration=0)\" \n\nAny idea why is this happening?
