In this case since no subsequent failure/reconnect event occurs, the command will never be resent.  If this is a synchronous command (like that generated by starting a connection) the calling thread will hang.\n\nIncidentally, my reading of the code is that only non-tracked commands can generate the IOException that triggers the handleTransportFailure command.  Is that what we really want?  \n\nMy belief is that the IOExceptions should always result in the triggering of the handleTransportFailure, regardless of origin.\n\nI will attach a unit test and fix shortly.  The test will often fail (i.e. hang) without the fix, but not always since I use a wireFormat.maxInactivityDurationInitalDelay=1 option to trigger the behavior.
