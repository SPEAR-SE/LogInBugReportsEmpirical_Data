I guess it is being misconfigured - but I can't see the problem after comparing to karaf/camel/fabric8 etc ;-)\n a) feature add war fails (needed by the broker web dependency) - but works on a vanilla karaf distro\n    the workaround is to manually install the bundles that it requires. That does not seem right to me.\n   see: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/trunk/activemq-karaf-itest/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/karaf/itest/ObrFeatureTest.java#L42\n\nb) for the camel route dropped into the deploy folder - it does not get deployed for some reason\n see: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/trunk/activemq-karaf-itest/src/test/java/org/apache/activemq/karaf/itest/ActiveMQBrokerNdExternalCamelFeatureTest.java#L47\n\nFor the embedded camel case, this bundlecontext issue. My hope is that there is some correlation between these, but that may not be the case. hope this helps :-)","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-01-22T12:54:50.542+0000","updated":"2015-01-22T12:54:50.542+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669344/comment/14291963","id":"14291963","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"the embedded case now works ok with the use of OsgiBundleXmlApplicationContext from the karaf service factory.\nWhy the external test case fails is still in the wind","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-01-26T15:41:10.582+0000","updated":"2015-01-26T15:41:10.582+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12669344/comment/16031039","id":"16031039","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davsclaus","name":"davsclaus","key":"davsclaus","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835"},"displayName":"Claus Ibsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Old ticket, create new ticket with newer versions of ActiveMQ if you can reproduce any kind of this","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davsclaus","name":"davsclaus","key":"davsclaus","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835"},"displayName":"Claus Ibsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2017-05-31T11:52:41.262+0000","updated":"2017-05-31T11:52:41.262+0000"}],"maxResults":9,"total":9,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-4727/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1o847:"}}
