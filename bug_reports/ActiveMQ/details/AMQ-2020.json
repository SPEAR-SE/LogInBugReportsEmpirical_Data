A queue caches its received messages up to a point and dispatches from this cache. However once the cache is exhausts, all remaining messages in the store are re dispatched. The resolution is to set the batch start point once the cache is full such that resuming after the cache is exhausted begins with the first non cached message rather than with the current start of the store. \nThe additional setBatch method that is present in the KahaStore probably needs to be pulled up into the MessageStore interface. currently there is a cast down in the cursor. If this solution proves generally applicable we can do this.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-03T18:04:17.367+0000","updated":"2008-12-03T18:04:17.367+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2020/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s267:"}}
