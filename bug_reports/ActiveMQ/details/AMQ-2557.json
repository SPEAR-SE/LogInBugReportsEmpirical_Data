However, when the temp store eventually fills as well, the broker goes comatose. It no longer accepts clients connections and stops dispatching messages to the slow consumer.  You'd expect the broker to at least continue dispatching messages to the slow consumer while the producer is blocked awaiting the temp store to free up.
