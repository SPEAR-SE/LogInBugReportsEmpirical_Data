It is easiest to reconcile what is happening if you imagine that the topics are foo/bar and \"\"/foo/bar - i.e. there is an empty hierarchy element at the beginning. This is consistent with the expectation that foo/bar and foo//bar are distinct topics. Again, think of this as like foo/\"\"/bar with a zero length hierarchy element in the middle.\n\nThis also influences the way wildcards work.
