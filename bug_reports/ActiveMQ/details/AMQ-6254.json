Instead both the restored and reconnected durable subscribers are being kept by the broker.\n\nAn example may help to clarify the issue:\n\n*Before restart*:\nTopic: alphabet.a\nDurable subscriber: aplhabet.>\n\n*After restart*:\nDurable subscriber: alphabet.a\n\n*After reconnect*:\nDurable subscriber: aplhabet.a\nDurable subscriber: alphabet.>\n\nAs messages sent to the topic are forwarded to both the restored and reconnected durable subscriber, but the restored subscriber is never being dequeued it consumes ever increasing amounts of memory.\n\nThe issue is related to AMQ-5153 as the restored subscriber has an incorrect subscribed destination (i.e. alhpabet.a instead of alphabet.>). \n\nHowever, the restored and reconnected durable subscribers only come into co-existence if the broker is run with broker plugins (i.e. authorization/authentication) as the use of DestinationFilters prevents the TopicRegion from running through all known Topics to remove possible matching subscriptions.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12799028","id":"12799028","filename":"AMQ6254Test.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy
