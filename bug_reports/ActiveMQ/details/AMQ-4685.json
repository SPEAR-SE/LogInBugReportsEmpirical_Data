For example, consider the following LDAP directory layout:\n\n{code}\ndc=example,dc=com\n   ou=ActiveMQ\n      ou=Users\n      ou=Roles\n      ou=Destinations\n   ou=People\n{code}\n\nIn this layout, accounts specific to ActiveMQ go under ou=Users,ou=ActiveMQ. However, some accounts in ou=People should also be able to have access to the ActiveMQ server. To avoid duplicating accounts, you can have the regular account (objectClass=inetOrgPerson) in ou=People and create an LDAP alias (objectClass=alias) for it in ou=People. The LDAP server then takes care about the alias resolution.\n\nThe JNDI LDAP client supports LDAP alias dereferencing as well. However, the search results for resolved aliases are different. For regular entries, SearchResult.getName() returns a relative DN and SearchResult.isRelative() returns true; for dereferenced aliases, SearchResult.getName() returns a full LDAP URI with the DN of the alias target (for example, 'ldap://localhost:389/uid=bob,ou=People,dc=example,dc=com') and SearchResult.isRelative() returns false (as documented, for example, in [1]).\n\nThe code in o.a.a.jaas.LDAPLoginModule does not make this distinction. It assumes that all returned names are RDNs and passes them to NameParser.parse() which in turn raises a NamingException because an LDAP URI is obviously not an LDAP (R)DN.\n\nThe attached patch resolved the problem at least for my configuration. If isRelative() returns false, the name is parsed as an URI. Per definition of LDAP URIs, the path component is the distinguished name, which is then taken.\n\nOf course, this does not take care of multiple layers of aliases, aliases for containers and so on - I just found it over the course of setting up LDAP  authentication in my system, which happens only to alias user accounts. It works for me with the patch and seems not to make things worse :) If needed, maybe I can do some further tests and/or correct the patch.\n\n[1] http://docs.oracle.com/javase/jndi/tutorial/ldap/misc/aliases.html","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12598447","id":"12598447","filename":"handle-ldap-aliases-v1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=podolsir","name":"podolsir","key":"podolsir","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Igor Podolskiy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-08-16T13:20:13.815+0000","size":2363,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12598447/handle-ldap-aliases-v1.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"344360","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"LDAPLoginModule throws InvalidNameException when resolving LDAP aliases","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=podolsir","name":"podolsir","key":"podolsir","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Igor Podolskiy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=podolsir","name":"podolsir","key":"podolsir","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Igor Podolskiy","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS Independent\nOpenLDAP 2.4","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12664057/comment/13811991","id":"13811991","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davsclaus","name":"davsclaus","key":"davsclaus","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835"},"displayName":"Claus Ibsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Thanks for the detailed explanation and the patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=davsclaus","name":"davsclaus","key":"davsclaus","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=davsclaus&avatarId=15835"},"displayName":"Claus Ibsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-11-02T13:50:33.034+0000","updated":"2013-11-02T13:50:33.034+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-4685/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1nc0n:"}}
