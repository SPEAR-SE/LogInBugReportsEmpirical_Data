Use spring Default Message listener container for consuming messages.\n3. Start the consumer application.\n4. wait for 70 seconds and start ActiveMQ.\n5. Consumers would be stuck - Issue would be reproduced\nNote: This issue does not happen if ActiveMQ is started after 120 seconds. That is after the second connection timeout. Issue can be reproduced with varying timeout values if AMQ is started before the second timeout but after the first timeout.
