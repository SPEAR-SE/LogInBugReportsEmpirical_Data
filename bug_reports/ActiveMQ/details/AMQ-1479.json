Updates to the reference store happen at a checkpoint() - asynchronously. The problem is that for a fast producer, the current data file (one being written to) can move on past the last known data file to the reference store. As the cleanup() task is a scheduled task - and not coupled to check points - the cleanup task can remove data files that the reference store is not yet aware of AND have are previous to the current data file being written too. \n\nThis issue can result in errors from the AMQ Store such as:\n\nMessage: java.io.IOException: Failed to read to journal for: offset = \n2374, file = 1, size = -1, type = 0.
