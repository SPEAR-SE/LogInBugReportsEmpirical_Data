I connect to it with a producer that pushes a single message onto the queue. I just ran that 70 times and told it to send 70 messages, which I then received. To the best of my knowledge, active should be idle. \n\nBrowsing in jconsole, I see the following data for the broker itself: \n\ntotalConsumerCount 1 - check - my one consumer \n\ntotalDequeueCount 70 - check - I put 70 on the queue. \n\ntotalEnqueueCount 768 - hmmm. Are there 689 somethings waiting to be cleared? \n\ntotalMessage 0 - makes sense, as I got every email that I asked for. There should be no messages left. \n\nLooking in the connection and connector mbeans, I see 70 messages enqueued, and 70 dequeued, which would fit with 70 being sent since I started the broker. Further, there were 140 connections. \n\nThe other anomaly I saw was the number of connections. Every time I queue up another twenty, I appear to get another connection. They have nothing enqueued, and nothing dequeued, and they are instances of org.apache.activemq.broker.jmx.ConnectionView. Even after everything is done, they show as active and connected, but not waiting. Anyone seen this behavior? \n\nSo, my question is why are there so many enqueues on the broker? As a side question, are there cases where the connection list just grows?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254674","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"There appear to be many more notifications enqueued than dequeued in my active installation","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=scottellsworth","name":"scottellsworth","key":"scottellsworth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Ellsworth","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=scottellsworth","name":"scottellsworth","key":"scottellsworth","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Ellsworth","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux, java 1.5.0_06","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481548/comment/12937559","id":"12937559","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"totalEqueueCount are just the amount of messages that have been enqueued; its not the total number of pending messages.\n\nI'm a little unsure about the 140 connections; the connections do get de-registered from JMX when the connection closes.
