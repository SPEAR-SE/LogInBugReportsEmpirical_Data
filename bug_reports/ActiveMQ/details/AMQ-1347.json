But consider the following scenario:\n\nHostA holds a consumer on q0.\nHostB wants to send a message and get a reply from HostA. So, it creates a producer on q0, and a temporary Queue tq on the same session. Then, sends a request message to q0 with the jmsReplyTo pointing to tq.\nHostA gets the message, and creates a producer on the temporary queue. This fires the AdvisoryBroker producer advisory topic creation for the temporary queue. \nHostA sends a new message on the temporary queue producer, and *closes it*.\nHostB gets the message, closes the session (what automatically closes the temporary queue consumer and the q0 producer) and *removes the temporary queue*.  When HostB removes the temporary queue, the AdvisoryBroker tries to delete the related consumer and advisory topics related with the temporary queue.\n\nTwo things can happen:\n# If HostA removeProducer command reaches the Broker before HostB removeDestination for the temporary queue, everything works fine.\n# If HostB removeDestination command reaches the broker before HostB removeProducer, the producer advisory topic for the temporary queue is deleted and then autocreated again at the AbstractRegion domain, because removeProducer fires a producer advisory message. This time, the producer advisory topic is never released, causing leakage and grief.\n\nAs a \"temporary\" solution, I've disabled producer advisories for temporary queues, and things seems to work, as I don't need those advisories, using something like this in AdvisoryBroker:\n\n{code:title=AdvisoryBroker.java}\n  public void addProducer(ConnectionContext context, ProducerInfo info) throws Exception {\n        next.addProducer(context, info);\n\n        // Don't advise advisory topics.        \n        if( info.getDestination()!=null && !AdvisorySupport.isAdvisoryTopic(info.getDestination()) \n                && !info.getDestination().isTemporary()) { \n            ActiveMQTopic topic = AdvisorySupport.getProducerAdvisoryTopic(info.getDestination());\n            fireAdvisory(context, topic, info);\n            producers.put(info.getProducerId(), info);\n        }\n    }\n{code}\n\nand the same thing for removeProducer.\n\nI think the problem not only applies to the temporary queues, but with their usage pattern, this bug is really problematic. \nConsider this as a dirty hack. I expect a better and brilliant solution to be released by the activemq brains. ;-)\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161845","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Producer advisory topic is not always deleted with the related destination","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mteira","name":"mteira","key":"mteira","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manuel Teira","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mteira","name":"mteira","key":"mteira","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Manuel Teira","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Sun Ultrasparc under Solaris 10, Oracle JDBC, no journal. activemq svn 4.1 branch or trunk","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1347/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s29z:"}}
