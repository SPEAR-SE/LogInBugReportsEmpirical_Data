So we're looking to define an effective minimum/maximum disk space usage as the same, and claim the space.  We have calculated a disk space size that should hold up to 0.5 days worth of production scale messages to be stored to allow for a reasonable period of consumer down time and to allow flexibility in an incident response.\n\nbut just to make sure I get this right when we do the upgrade, is this what we should do (based on the above attached activemq.xml)?\n\n* enable 'checkForCorruptJournalFiles'\n* set the 'preallocationStrategy' - though with what, the documentation at http://activemq.apache.org/kahadb.html  are the only valid options ['sparse_file', 'zeros', 'os_kernel_copy']   I would have chosen 'zeros' here just to be sure (we're running Oracle Linux 6.x )\n\nIs there any other suggestions to maximize uptime in this regards?\n\nthanks heaps for the response.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=psmith%40apache.org","name":"psmith@apache.org","key":"psmith@apache.org","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Smith","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"created":"2016-01-24T22:20:29.862+0000","updated":"2016-01-24T22:20:29.862+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12933042/comment/15117148","id":"15117148","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"fyi https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6084 in 5.13.1 may also be relevant","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-01-26T12:48:43.135+0000","updated":"2016-01-26T12:48:43.135+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12933042/comment/15193637","id":"15193637","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Configuration in new broker releases exists to work around the presented problems.
