It actually behaves a little more predictably, if we try to access the service locally everything works great, if the server and client are in different machines every call to connect blocks permanently. I would think that this problem should have a priority higher than \"Minor\" since it makes mqtt over ssl unusable... \nWe use activemq server and clients in windows and tried both mqtt+nio+ssl and mqtt+ssl without success. Using only tcp connections everything works fine.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pmarques","name":"pmarques","key":"pmarques","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pedro Marques","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-03-19T10:04:33.444+0000","updated":"2013-03-19T10:04:33.444+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633271/comment/13606479","id":"13606479","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Pedro, what MQTT client are you using to connect to the Broker with?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2013-03-19T16:36:34.175+0000","updated":"2013-03-19T16:36:34.175+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633271/comment/13607508","id":"13607508","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pmarques","name":"pmarques","key":"pmarques","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pedro Marques","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I was testing the system with fusesource client...
