We can provide details of the code or the WAS/AMQ config. \n\nWhilst stating this doesn't work for a Hello World MDB, this is for simplicity and ease of testing this issue, in reality we are using the MDB and AMQ as part of a full blown integration solution at 2 major Utility companies and seriously need some assistance with this. Testing onsite of the solution at each of these companies has revealed this issue, this is therefore preventing the move of the solution into production. \n\nWe cannot revert to the use of the version 3.2.2 of AMQ as there are some memory limitations with this version (that have been addressed in 4.x) that mean that it will not cope with the volumes of messages that are required to be handled. \n\nThanks,\nStephen Murray\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460670","id":"12460670","filename":"AMQ-1060.zip","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=muzza","name":"muzza","key":"muzza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Murray","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-23T22:07:50.000+0000","size":224756,"mimeType":"application/zip","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460670/AMQ-1060.zip"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460575","id":"12460575","filename":"MDBTester.ear","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=muzza","name":"muzza","key":"muzza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Murray","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-11-23T22:14:26.000+0000","size":5281946,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460575/MDBTester.ear"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"172316","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Unable to connect to AMQ 4.x queue with MDB","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=muzza","name":"muzza","key":"muzza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Murray","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=muzza","name":"muzza","key":"muzza","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Murray","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS Windows 2003 Server, AMQ 4.0.2, Websphere 5.1.11","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483146/comment/12938635","id":"12938635","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=aco","name":"aco","key":"aco","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Adrian Co","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Kindly attach the broker and client logs with debug turned on and whatever configuration you used for the broker and client.
