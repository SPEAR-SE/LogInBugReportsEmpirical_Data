limiting the Temp Table space the broker will dead lock:\n\n- 1 Producer Thread (own connection) writing to VirtualTopic.FooTwo\n-- writes 40000 messages\n- 2 Consumer Threads (each own connection) consuming from Consumer.X.VirtualTopic.FooTwo\n-- consumes message (auto ack - but message ack for good measure - delay of 100ms between consumption)\n\nThe dead lock occurs when using the either the KahaDB or ActiveMQPersistence persistence, and seems more related to the KahaDB implementation used for the Temp storage area.\n\nI shall attach a test jar, which is a executable jar, from which the issue can be replicated (I shall attach a zip of the source too - maven project)\n\nThe tests can be run as:\n\n- java -classpath 5.4.1-deadlock-jar-with-dependencies.jar
