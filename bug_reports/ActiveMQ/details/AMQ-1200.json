Because of this the _Session.run()_ method invoked by _ServerSessionImpl.run()_ does not throw any exception but instead just doesn't do anything (and in particular does not deliver any messages to the _MessageListener_ registered with the _Session_).\n\nI have modified the _ServerSessionImplTest_ test case to include a test for the _ServerSessionImpl_ to detect a stopped Session. I have tried to use Alex' diff in order to solve the problem but it didn't work for me. However, I have added some lines to _ServerSessionImpl_ to check if its Session is still running before calling its run() method. If it doesn't, the _ServerSessionImpl_ is marked as stale and will be evicted from the _ServerSessionPoolImpl_ using the _removeFromPool_ method  ... Pending messages are then dispatched to another (new) _ServerSessionImpl_ in the pool.\n\nKai","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudalla","name":"hudalla","key":"hudalla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Hudalla","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-21T15:48:55.396+0000","updated":"2008-04-21T15:48:55.396+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482334/comment/12939568","id":"12939568","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudalla","name":"hudalla","key":"hudalla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Hudalla","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fix for AMQ-1200","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hudalla","name":"hudalla","key":"hudalla","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kai Hudalla","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-21T15:53:38.230+0000","updated":"2008-04-21T15:53:38.230+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482334/comment/12939573","id":"12939573","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fixed by SVN revision 650392","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-22T07:09:07.954+0000","updated":"2008-04-22T07:09:07.954+0000"}],"maxResults":6,"total":6,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1200/votes","votes":3,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0rrq7:"}}
