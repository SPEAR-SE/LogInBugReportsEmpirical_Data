This originated as the question/answers that follow:\n\nI am trying to use my custom authenticationPlugin (which installs a SimpleAuthenticationBroker) along with an XML definition for the authorizationPlugin as follows in the activemq.xml file: \n\n   <bean id=\"MYAuthenticationPlugin\" class=\"com.someplace.MYAuthenticationPlugin\"/> \n\n   <broker xmlns=\"http://activemq.apache.org/schema/core\" brokerName=\"localhost\" dataDirectory=\"${activemq.base}/data\" plugins=\"#MYAuthenticationPlugin\"> \n\n<plugins> \n\n<authorizationPlugin> \n<map> \n<authorizationMap> \n   <authorizationEntries> \n      <authorizationEntry queue=\">\" read=\"ADMIN\" write=\"ADMIN\" admin=\"ADMIN\" /> \n      <authorizationEntry queue=\"TOOL.>\" read=\"USER\" write=\"USER\" admin=\"ADMIN\" /> \n      <authorizationEntry topic=\">\" read=\"ADMIN\" write=\"ADMIN\" admin=\"ADMIN\" /> \n      <authorizationEntry topic=\"TOOL.>\" read=\"USER\" write=\"USER\" admin=\"ADMIN\" /> \n      <authorizationEntry topic=\"ActiveMQ.Advisory.>\" read=\"ADMIN,USER\" \n          write=\"ADMIN,USER\" admin=\"ADMIN,USER\"/> \n   </authorizationEntries> \n\n<tempDestinationAuthorizationEntry> \n<tempDestinationAuthorizationEntry read=\"tempDestinationAdmins\" \nwrite=\"tempDestinationAdmins\" admin=\"tempDestinationAdmins\"/> \n</tempDestinationAuthorizationEntry> \n\n</authorizationMap> \n</map> \n</authorizationPlugin> \n\n</plugins> \n\n... \n</broker> \n\nThe problem I have is when I define <plugins>, it takes over and MYAuthenticationPlugin isn't installed.  Is there some way to put \"two\" plugins in the defintion for the <broker>?  Or is there a way I can refer to MYAuthenticationPlugin in the <plugins> section?  I have tried a lot of things with no success getting both of there pieces of the security pie. \n\nAny ideas would be greatly appreciated, \n\nThanks, \nBarbara \n \n\n Re: authorizationPlugin and authenticationPlugin  by Dejan Bosanac-3 Nov 18, 2008; 07:06am :: Rate this Message:    - Use ratings to moderate (?)\n\nReply | Reply to Author | Print | View Threaded | Show Only this Message \n \nIt seems there is a bug in that XBean plugins override custom plugins \ninstantiated with \"plugins\" attribute.
