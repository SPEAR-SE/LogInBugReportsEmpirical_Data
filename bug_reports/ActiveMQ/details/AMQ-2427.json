In the brief example below, if I comment out the amq script sections, everything works fine (the line marked \"ERROR occurs here\" executes with expected results, pulling the Tselect=8 from the URL). When I add in the calls to source amq.js and setup the amq.uri, I get the following two errors:\n\ninvalid array length\nfile:///C:/apache-activemq-5.2.0/webapps/Client/amq/prototype.js Line 464\njQuery.query is undefined\nfile:///C:/apache-activemq-5.2.0/webapps/Client/test.html?Tselect=8 Line 14\n\nI've intentionally pared down the example to not require accessing the html file via the ActiveMQ/Jetty app server, to show the collision from a simple file load. I began to post this issue to the jquery list, but I recall seeing something about a release of amq.js that removes its dependency on prototype.js. Is that available, and would that help? Anyone have an idea for how to fix this?\n\nThanks,\nDoug\n\n\n<html>\n<head>\n<meta http-equiv=\"Content-Type\" content=\"text/html; charset=ISO-8859-1\">\n<title>Test amq/jQuery.query plugin conflict</title>\n<!-- -->\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"amq/amq.js\"></script>\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\">amq.uri='amq';</script>\n<!-- -->\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lib/jquery.js\"></script>\n      <script type=\"text/javascript\" src=\"lib/jquery.query.js\"></script>\n      <script>\n      jQuery.noConflict();\n      jQuery(document).ready(function(){\n            var Tselect = jQuery.query.get('Tselect'); // ERROR occurs here\n        Tinfo = \"Tselect:\" + Tselect + \":\";\n        jQuery(\"#TestArea\").append(\"<pre>\" + Tinfo + \"\\n</pre>\");\n      //amq.addListener('T.ID', 'topic://' + Tselect + '.OUT', _handler.recvMessage);\n        \n      });\n      </script>\n</head>\n<body>\n<div id=\"TestArea\"></div>\n</body>\n</html>\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"59776","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Collision between amq.js and jquery.query.js","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dknight526","name":"dknight526","key":"dknight526","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Knight","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dknight526","name":"dknight526","key":"dknight526","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Doug Knight","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP SP3, with jQuery 1.3.2, jquery.query.js plugin 2.1.6","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2427/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0almf:"}}
