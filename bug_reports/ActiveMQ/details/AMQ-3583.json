The server and each of the clients have their own internal ActiveMQ broker which are then joined in to a network of brokers. \n\nAfter having ran successfully for almost two months the server on one of our customer installations stopped communicating with the clients. Based on the logs available (see the attachment) the issue seems to stem from ActiveMQ, which is failing to page in messages and retrieving messages because of NullPointerExceptions. The situation was only resolved after we instructed the customer to restart the server process, which also restarted the ActiveMQ broker.\n\nSadly we do not have remote access to that particular installation so we could not investigate the issue closer. The only diagnostics we have about the issue are the aforementioned log statements.\n\nThe broker is using Apache DerbyDB 10.6.1.0 for storage instead of the KahaDB.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12503068","id":"12503068","filename":"exceptions.log","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pauli","name":"pauli","key":"pauli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pauli Kaila","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2011-11-09T12:38:29.914+0000","size":1790,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12503068/exceptions.log"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"81461","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Failures to page in queue messages and retrieving messages caused by NullPointerExceptions","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pauli","name":"pauli","key":"pauli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pauli Kaila","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pauli","name":"pauli","key":"pauli","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pauli Kaila","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Network of brokers running on Windows XP SP3 machines.
