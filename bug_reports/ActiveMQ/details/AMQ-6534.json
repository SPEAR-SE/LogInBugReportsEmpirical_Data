I have seen this behaviour in ActiveMQ 5.13.3 and 5.14.1 \n\nTo replicate this issue following needs to be done. \n\n1. Publish 3 messages to queue Test \n2. In a stand alone code have a message listener which goes to sleep call of onMessage() (sleep for 10 mins) (Session is transacted false and Auto Acknowledge) \n3. In a different Stand alone code have a queue browser code with no selector specified. \n\nWe can see that QueueBrowser returns all the three messages instead of 2. \n\nThis behaviour differ from how Weblogic JMS, HornetQ and Apache Artemis work.\n\nI am not sure if the above behaviour is intended. However it would be a great if ActiveMQ provides a way for QueueBrowsers to not see unacknowledged messages.\n\nDisscussion on ActiveMQ Dev Forum :- http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/ActiveMQ-5-14-1-QueueBrowser-can-view-messages-being-processed-by-consumers-which-are-not-yet-unacknd-td4719662.html\n\n \n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"QueueBrowser can view messages being processed by consumers which are not yet acknowledged","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yogu13","name":"yogu13","key":"yogu13","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yogesh Rao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yogu13","name":"yogu13","key":"yogu13","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Yogesh Rao","active":true,"timeZone":"Asia/Kolkata"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13027334/comment/15741661","id":"15741661","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"there is a related fix: https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5274 but that was only applied to the jmx browse, a jms queue browser uses a different code path.
