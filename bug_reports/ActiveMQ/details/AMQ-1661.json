One of the clients on A is subscribing to a queue, the other is publishing to it.  The client on B is not using that queue at all.  When the publishing client sends a message, the subscriber receives it as expected.  But if I watch the network with a sniffer, I can see the message being sent to broker B and back again. \n\nI also set up a topic that all of the clients subscribe to.  If a client on A sends a message to the topic, the client on B receives it normally, but the two clients on A receive the message twice.  I can see with the sniffer that the message is being sent from A to B and back. \n\nIf I change the connection so that it's not duplex (i.e. I set up matching simplex connections on both brokers) all of this unexpected behavior goes away.  In the first example, the messages are no longer forwarded to B since there are no subscribers on that broker.  In the second example, the message is received once by every subscriber. \n\nI have tested on various 5.1 snapshots up through
