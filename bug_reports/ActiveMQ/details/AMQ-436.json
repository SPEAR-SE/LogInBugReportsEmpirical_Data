The trick is to set up your JMS queues as \"myCompany/myQueue\" rather then \"/myCompany/myQueue\".  Then, you can send STOMP messages to activeMQ using \"/queue/myCompany/myQueue\" as the destination.  (the initial \"/queue/\" gets eaten by STOMP)  Same should work in reverse.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=feldrax","name":"feldrax","key":"feldrax","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Stanton","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2005-12-12T21:57:20.000+0000","updated":"2005-12-12T21:57:20.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481393/comment/12937719","id":"12937719","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Looks like the issue was resolved.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2006-06-13T03:36:06.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-13T03:36:06.000+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-436/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i17yun:"}}
