This is to ensure that acks do not occur where they should not and do not occur out of order as this would really, really munge the state of the broker. FWIW, there are many more details to this situation that I'm glossing over. To support such functionality would require a very significant amount of work/surgery on the broker! \n\nThe bottom line is that the suspend/resume of transactions is not supported in ActiveMQ.
