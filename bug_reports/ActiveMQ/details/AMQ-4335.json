Perhaps I can fill in some details.\n\nThe problem, simply stated, is I want to produce a TextMessage whose message size is over 100MB.  I seem to be prevented from doing so by the DEFAULT MAX FRAME SIZE parameter.\n\nIn order to effect this change, I made the following changes to activmq and to my application:\n\n1. I am running Activemq 5.8.0.\nWe are using a native broker, not an embedded broker.  We must use TextMessage, not BytesMessage.\n\n\nIn ACTIVEMQ_HOME/conf/activemq.xml\n\nI made the follwowing changes:\n\n<transportConnectors>\n <transportConnector name=\"openwire\" uri=\"tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?maximumConnections=1000&wireformat.maxFrameSize=157286400\"/>\n <transportConnector name=\"amqp\" uri=\"amqp://0.0.0.0:5672?maximumConnections=1000&wireformat.maxFrameSize=157286400\"/>\n </transportConnectors>\n\nand also:\n <policyEntry queue=\">\" producerFlowControl=\"true\" memoryLimit=\"20mb\"> (I increased this to 20mb)\n\nAnd also:\n  <managementContext>\n            <managementContext createConnector=\"true\"/> (I changed this to true)\n        </managementContext>\n\nAnd also\n <systemUsage>\n            <systemUsage>\n                <memoryUsage>\n                    <memoryUsage limit=\"950 mb\"/> ( I changed this to 950mb)\n                </memoryUsage>\n                <storeUsage>\n                    <storeUsage limit=\"100 gb\"/>\n                </storeUsage>\n                <tempUsage>\n                    <tempUsage limit=\"50 gb\"/>\n                </tempUsage>\n            </systemUsage>\n        </systemUsage>\n\n\n2. When I start activemq (in a cmd line console), I inspect the activemq.log and see:\n2013-02-22 14:28:14,333 | DEBUG | Publishing: tcp://Lucille-Win7-PC:61616 for broker transport URI: tcp://Lucille-Win7-PC:61616?maximumConnections=1000&wireformat.maxFrameSize=157286400 | org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnector | main\n2013-02-22 14:28:14,333 | DEBUG | Publishing: amqp://0.0.0.0:5672 for broker transport URI: amqp://0.0.0.0:5672?maximumConnections=1000&wireformat.maxFrameSize=157286400 | org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnector | main\n\nThis leads me to believe that activemq will accept a message larger than 100MB.\n\n3. Next I run my application (not my unit tests).\nWhen I do, my RSIProducerToClient producer.send(TextMessage) does send the TextMessage.  My application does not detect any exceptions.\nMy client application (waiting for this message) does not get the message at all.  My client application times out while waiting on this message.\nWe look on the queue and we do not see the message either enqueued or dequeued.\n\nWhen we inspect the activemq.log we see:\n\n2013-02-22 14:30:20,692 | DEBUG | Transport Connection to: tcp://192.168.2.106:50385 failed: java.io.IOException: Frame size of 140 MB larger than max allowed 100 MB | org.apache.activemq.broker.TransportConnection.Transport | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///192.168.2.106:50385@61616\njava.io.IOException: Frame size of 140 MB larger than max allowed 100 MB\n\tat org.apache.activemq.openwire.OpenWireFormat.unmarshal(OpenWireFormat.java:277)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransport.readCommand(TcpTransport.java:221)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransport.doRun(TcpTransport.java:213)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.transport.tcp.TcpTransport.run(TcpTransport.java:196)\n\tat java.lang.Thread.run(Thread.java:662)\n\n\n4. \nIt seems to us, that Activemq is allowing the possibility of sending a message over 100MB when Activemq starts up.  When we put the maxFrameSize in the activemq.xml and then we see that value (which is 157286400) parroted back when we start up Activemq in a console, we believe that ActiveMQ will be able to allow us to send a message of up to 150MB.\n\nBut when we actually DO send such a large message, the message is not allowed.  \n\nPlease help us to figure out how to send a TextMessage which is over 100mb long.  \n\n\n\n\n\nThank you.\nLucille Wilson","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lagrwilson","name":"lagrwilson","key":"lagrwilson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lucille Wilson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-02-22T21:59:51.328+0000","updated":"2013-02-22T21:59:51.328+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633091/comment/13584800","id":"13584800","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Here is a simple maven project that will build and run everything for you.

default of 100MB in other code.  There is a discrepancy between values in maxFrameSize in the lines labeled 'Using min of local', 'Received WireFormat', 'before negotiation', and 'after negotiation'.\n\nI still think there is a bug.\nLucille Wilson","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lagrwilson","name":"lagrwilson","key":"lagrwilson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lucille Wilson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-02-25T21:08:44.252+0000","updated":"2013-02-25T21:08:44.252+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633091/comment/13586387","id":"13586387","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ceposta","name":"ceposta","key":"ceposta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051"},"displayName":"Christian Posta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"K looks like you're getting the max frame size set properly on the broker.

I switch that out and put in the activemq-all-5.8.0.jar.\nNow I can properly send TextMessage whose payload is over 100MB.  \n\nThe two changes I had to make were:\n1. spell wireFormat correctly in the activemq.xml\n2. add the activemq-all-5.8.0.jar to my project.\n\nThank you, Thank you, Thank you!\n\nHowever, I have two suggestions for changes, please.\n1. When the activemq project is distributed, the conf/activemq.xml spells wireformat with a small 'f'.  Please fix this, because if you use the small 'f' then the maxFrameSize is not set to a number other than the default. (I tested this).  \n\nSo activemq.xml should read:\n<transportConnectors>\n            <!-- DOS protection, limit concurrent connections to 1000 and frame size to 100MB -->\n            <transportConnector name=\"openwire\" uri=\"tcp://0.0.0.0:61616?maximumConnections=1000&amp;wireFormat.maxFrameSize=104857600\"/>\n            <transportConnector name=\"amqp\" uri=\"amqp://0.0.0.0:5672?maximumConnections=1000&amp;wireFormat.maxFrameSize=104857600\"/>\n        </transportConnectors>\n\n2. Please document this a bit better. On this page:\nhttp://activemq.apache.org/configuring-wire-formats.html\nPlease mention that the default value is NOT max long, but 104857600 (i.e. 100MB), that the value is the number of bytes (not megabytes, gigabytes or any other thing).\n\nThank you and thank Timothy for all your help.\nLucille Wilson","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lagrwilson","name":"lagrwilson","key":"lagrwilson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lucille Wilson","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-02-26T16:33:50.622+0000","updated":"2013-02-26T16:33:50.622+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12633091/comment/13587247","id":"13587247","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"1. I corrected the configuration file to use the right case.\n2. The default is indeed Long.MAX_VALUE as you can find by code inspection of OpenWireFormatFactory.java the reason you were getting into this situation is that you had mixed an old client library with a newer broker instance and that version of the client lib was sending wireFormat.maxFrameSize of 100MB to the broker.  Wireformat negotiation always takes the LOWEST value of the two that are exchanged at connection time which means no matter what you set on the broker if it was greater than the client's 100mb value the broker always chose the lower one.  \n\nThis is why it a good idea not to mix older client's with newer broker's if you can help it as issue fixed in the client and broker code can emerge and in some cases new more difficult to find issues can appear.
