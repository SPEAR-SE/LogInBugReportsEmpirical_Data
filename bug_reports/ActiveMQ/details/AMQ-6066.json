Running a number of jstacks I can see the broker is often stuck here:\n{noformat}\n\"Queue:master-items\" Id=122 RUNNABLE\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.region.cursors.OrderedPendingList.contains(OrderedPendingList.java:144)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.doPageInForDispatch(Queue.java:1930)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.pageInMessages(Queue.java:2119)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue.iterate(Queue.java:1596)\n\t-  locked java.lang.Object@253c3089\n\tat org.apache.activemq.thread.DedicatedTaskRunner.runTask(DedicatedTaskRunner.java:112)\n\tat org.apache.activemq.thread.DedicatedTaskRunner$1.run(DedicatedTaskRunner.java:42)\n\n\tNumber of locked synchronizers = 1\n\t- java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock$NonfairSync@2eb46567\n{noformat}\nFor this specific queue in my application, there were a large number of items in it.. around 100,000.  However I noticed the code for contains has:\n{code}\n    public boolean contains(MessageReference message) {\n        if (message != null) {\n            for (PendingNode value : map.values()) {\n                if (value.getMessage().equals(message)) {\n                    return true;\n                }\n            }\n        }\n        return false;\n    }\n{code}\nThis will obviously be very slow.  Given the Map is keyed by message ID, can't we do a .contains(message.getMessageId()) instead?  I noticed the remove() method does this.  I changed the code to do this:\n{code}\n@Override\npublic boolean contains(MessageReference message) {\n    if (message != null) {\n        return map.containsKey(message.getMessageId());\n    }\n    return false;\n}\n{code}\nI got a speedup for my test which now takes 29 minutes from 41 minutes.  Can we get this change in to the upcoming 5.13 release (pretty please??)  It is a tiny (but very important) change for us.. many thanks.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Performance issue in OrderedPendingList","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sits","name":"sits","key":"sits","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Sitsky","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sits","name":"sits","key":"sits","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Sitsky","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Sydney"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12916709/comment/15030616","id":"15030616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Commit 673c2928a1b567958c2d9eabe2995a039f2aa1e2 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~cshannon]\n[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=673c292 ]\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6066\n\nImproving performance of OrderedPendingList contains method\n\nThanks for David Sitsky for the patch\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-11-28T18:26:55.188+0000","updated":"2015-11-28T18:26:55.188+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12916709/comment/15030620","id":"15030620","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
