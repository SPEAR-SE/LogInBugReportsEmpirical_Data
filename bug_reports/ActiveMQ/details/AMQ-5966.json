A ServerSessionPool is provided which creates ServerSessions with transacted JMS sessions. Up to ActiveMQ 5.11.2, everything has worked fine, but with ActiveMQ 5.12.0, after rollback of a sesseion, the application hangs until JMS re-connect happens. Further investigation reveals that with ActiveMQ 5.11.2 and earlier, after rollback a new ServerSession is taken from the pool and loaded with the message of the rolled back session. With ActiveMQ 5.12.0, however, the MessageListener of the same session is called again. This is a problem with the ConnectionConsumer protocol, because the may have claimed the session for recycling.\n\nThe attached piece of test code (AMQRollbackTest.java) demonstrates the issue. It runs fine with ActiveMQ 5.11.2 and hangs with ActiveMQ 5.12.0. It demonstrates the issue for QueueSessions, but TopicSessions are affected equally.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12755608","id":"12755608","filename":"AMQRollbackTest.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreasmattes","name":"andreasmattes","key":"andreasmattes","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mattes","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-09-13T15:52:25.125+0000","size":4929,"mimeType":"text/x-java","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12755608/AMQRollbackTest.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ActiveMQ client hangs after rollback of a transacted JMS session","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreasmattes","name":"andreasmattes","key":"andreasmattes","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mattes","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=andreasmattes","name":"andreasmattes","key":"andreasmattes","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas Mattes","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Reproduced standalone under Linux, but any environment should be affected.","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12863698/comment/14746427","id":"14746427","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
