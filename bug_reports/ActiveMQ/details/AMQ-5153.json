You never get a new broker you reuse a broker, stopping  and starting it.  My guess is the LevelDBPersistentAdapter probably does not get rid of state on the stop of a broker and reuses that state on a start.\n\nHope this helps.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=badavis","name":"badavis","key":"badavis","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Brian Davis","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2015-04-25T03:33:40.447+0000","updated":"2015-04-25T03:33:40.447+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709191/comment/15242615","id":"15242615","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=osmanrafiq","name":"osmanrafiq","key":"osmanrafiq","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Osman Rafiq","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Hi guys,\n\nWe are having an issue related (the same?) to the one [~badavis] is describing on both ActiveMQ 5.11.1 and 5.12.2.\n\nFrom our loggings it seems that the Level DB adapter somehow replaces the *subscribedDestination* field of SubscriptionInfo with the *desitnation* field.\nBefore restart (what is being sent to LevelDB):\n2016-04-14 15:23:21,601 | DEBUG | alphabet.a store adding subscription: SubscriptionInfo {*subscribedDestination = topic://alphabet.>, destination = topic://alphabet.a*, clientId = CFH.BO.TCS, subscriptionName = alphabet.>, selector = null} | org.apache.activemq.store.LoggingTopicMessageStore | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp:///10.0.6.1:55924@61616\n\nAfter restart (what broker is reading back from LevelDB):\n2016-04-14 15:24:15,774 | DEBUG | Restoring durable subscription: SubscriptionInfo {*subscribedDestination = topic://alphabet.a, destination = null*, clientId = CFH.BO.TCS, subscriptionName = alphabet.>, selector = null} | org.apache.activemq.broker.region.TopicRegion\n\nI have attached an updated version of the previously mentioned unit test to  verify the issue hopefully.\n\nNote that the bug alone is not that severe as the TopicRegion correctly replaces the restored faulty subscription when reconnecting the durable subscriber. \n\nHowever, if the broker is being used with broker plugins (especially the authorization/authentication plugins) then the TopicRegion is not able to replace the faulty subscription and you end up having a ghost subscriber.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=osmanrafiq","name":"osmanrafiq","key":"osmanrafiq","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Osman Rafiq","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2016-04-15T08:04:06.224+0000","updated":"2016-04-15T08:04:06.224+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12709191/comment/15247775","id":"15247775","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Commit b027e655538226b56f1fe277a426e0df41501fc6 in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~tabish121]\n[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=b027e65 ]\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-5153\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6254\n\nStore the original subscribed destination along with the target\ndestination in the subscription info object to ensure that wildcard\nsubscriptions remain linked.
