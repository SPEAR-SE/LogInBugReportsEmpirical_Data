I don't really know how to interrupt the all, so the test case never finishes.  Anyway, it does show the problem and is 100% repeatable on my system.\n\nThe config file is set to use a SQLServer database, but the stock journal or a derby persistence manager will do the same thing.  I just switched to mssql server because I can then see what is going on in the database.  And records are being added to the database all the way up to when the server hangs.
