This means that the KeepAlive sent never results in receive activity.

I was able to freeze brokers and have them disconnect from each other, but recover after unfreezing.  Same for clients.\n\nNondurable messages are still queued to a disconnected broker, but that can be mitigated by having the asyncDispatch and an eviction strategy to your liking.  I'd rather see the subscriptions dropped, and no further queuing, but maybe that wasn't doable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaussy","name":"yaussy","key":"yaussy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Yaussy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-03-23T15:55:32.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-23T15:55:32.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481549/comment/12937541","id":"12937541","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"We could always raise another feature request JIRA for the subscription dropping; also for nondurable messaging we have the option to drop old messages if consumers slow down.\n\nSo is this issue resolved now?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-03-23T16:08:25.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-23T16:08:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481549/comment/12937590","id":"12937590","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaussy","name":"yaussy","key":"yaussy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Yaussy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I'm very happy with the eviction policy features.  We will make *extensive* use of that (btw, we may want to implement an eviction  policy at some point - any way to do that ?).  However, I can raise a feature request for the subscription dropping.\n\nOne thing I forgot to mention in my comment above is that the broker networkConnector url config changed again.  You now have to explicitly put on failover if you want broker-to-broker connections to use failover.  That dropped off at one point (I was trying to find where you and I conversed about that - it was some other JIRA entry), where you would get double failover transport decorators, thus causing problems with shutdown.  You said that static would do the same thing.\n\nAnyway, not a big deal, but I believe you had updated some documentation regarding this.  So, you might want to revisit that again.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaussy","name":"yaussy","key":"yaussy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Yaussy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-03-23T16:17:12.000+0000","updated":"2006-03-23T16:17:12.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481549/comment/12937576","id":"12937576","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yaussy","name":"yaussy","key":"yaussy","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Yaussy","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Doh!
