This means that no other messages are delivered as only the in-memory collection is checked for messages awaiting dispatch.\n\nThe size of the in-memory collection is controlled by the maxPageSize parameter.\n\nAdditionally (and the cause of much confusion in our setup) the expired message scheduled task, which runs every 30s by default, will page in more than maxPageSize messages, causing additional non-slow messages to be available for dispatch. This results in what appeared to be a 30s bursting of messages sent to all non-slow consumers.\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2217 - the same issue but talks about message selectors instead of JMSXGroupID\nhttp://stackoverflow.com/q/23810807/317404 - my question on StackOverflow","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"395092","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Dispatch of messages within JMSXGroupID is affected by maxPageSize","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattnathan","name":"mattnathan","key":"mattnathan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Nathan","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mattnathan","name":"mattnathan","key":"mattnathan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matt Nathan","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5200/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i1w033:"}}
