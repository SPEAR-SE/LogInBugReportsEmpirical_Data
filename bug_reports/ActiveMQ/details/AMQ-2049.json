Currently this results in the same ConnectionInfo object in the AMQConnection and the TransportConnection.\n\nNow when you get to AMQConnection.cleanup() it asynchronously sends a message to the broker to clean up and immediately sets the configured clientID to null.  When the RegionBroker processes the remove message the clientID is no longer set (assuming bad luck in thread scheduling) and it complains:\n\n    public void removeConnection(ConnectionContext context, ConnectionInfo info, Throwable error) throws Exception {\n        String clientId = info.getClientId();\n        if (clientId == null) {\n            throw new InvalidClientIDException(\"No clientID specified for connection disconnect request\");\n        }\n\nOne fix for this is to copy the connectionInfo before sending it to the broker.  This is a small but unnecessary cost for non-vm transports but works.\nAnother fix might be to send the close message synchronously so it's processed before the clientID is nulled out.\n\nI'm committing the \"copy\" solution but IMO this should be reviewed by experts.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"233466","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race condition cleaning connection using VMTransport","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482751/comment/12940570","id":"12940570","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=djencks","name":"djencks","key":"djencks","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David Jencks","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"rev 730226 solves this by copying.
