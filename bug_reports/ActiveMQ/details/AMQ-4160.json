As a result, concurrent attempts to add a bridge to the same URL can be allowed to proceed to bridge creation.  Only one of the bridges will be established (the other will fail when it attempts to add duplicate connections); however, the failure of the second bridge will result in a call to {{onServiceRemove(...)}} that will remove the single/shared {{bridges}} entry.\n# The bridge is started before an entry is added to {{bridges}}.  Since bridges are multi-threaded, it is possible that an exception will be handled by a different thread at some time between {{bridge.start()}} and {{bridges.put(uri, bridge}}.  In processing this exception, the thread will call {{onServiceRemove(...}}, which will remove the (non-existent) {{bridges}} entry.  Subseqently, {{bridges.put(uri, bridge)}} is executed, and adds the entry to {{bridges}} even though it is now stale and represents a failed bridge.  Subsequent attempts to restore the bridge will be ignored, and no active bridge will be created.\n\nThe lack of thread-safety in {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} is exacerbated by AMQ-4159, which can result in many concurrent attempts to establish a bridge to the same URL.  AMQ-4159 also described how multiple calls can be made to {{onServiceRemove(...)}}, which can result in mal-behaviour similar to the second case described above (i.e., unexpected removal of a bridge that is active).\n\nSolution\n========\nThe attached patch attempts to restore some thread-safety to {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} by making the check-and-set atomic and adding the entry to {{bridges}} prior to starting the bridge.  An additional structure, {{activeEvents}}, keeps track of the event that represents the current attempt to establish a bridge to a given remote URL --- this is used to prevent multiple calls to {{onServiceRemove(...)}} from removing a {{bridges}} entry that was *not* added by the corresponding discovery event.  \n\nThis patch is a band aid to the design flaws in {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}}, and a refactoring of the connector should be considered.  In particular, there is a tight-coupling between {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} and {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent}} that is not evident through their interfaces.  For example, {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} assumes that the call to {{discoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}} will result in a call back to {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceRemove(...)}}.  The call to {{onServiceRemove(...)}} is necessary to clean up the resources used by the bridge, but that requirement is not explicit, and therefore easily missed.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12553390","id":"12553390","filename":"AMQ4160_2.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stirlingc","name":"stirlingc","key":"stirlingc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stirling

I linked AMQ-4159 and AMQ-4160 together as they are related (at least the symptoms were observed during the same test that we were running). Now that I think about it, the fix for AMQ-4160 relies on AMQ-4159 (i.e., one-to-one relationship between DiscoveryEvent and a bridge creation attempt). It would be great if AMQ-4160 could also be fixed for AMQ 5.8.0.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stirlingc","name":"stirlingc","key":"stirlingc","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stirling Chow","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-11-05T16:46:30.277+0000","updated":"2012-11-05T16:46:30.277+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12614725/comment/13490892","id":"13490892","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Needed to confirm that this didn't break any tests and there's currently some instability in some of the network tests.
