In attempt to reconnect VMTransportServer class creates linked pair of VMTransport objects(client and server) and started them asynchronously to be used in bridge between local and remote brokers. If hub is still down TCP transport raise exception and then clean up process is trying to destroy this pair of VMtransport objects.\nHowever if due to race condition VMtransport objects have not been fully initialized yet it is impossible to destroy them properly.\nThis excerpt describe how VMtransport  tries to shutdown a peer:\n try {\n            peer.transportListener.onCommand(new ShutdownInfo());                    \n            } catch (Exception ignore) {\n            }\n\n            // let any requests pending a response see an exception\n            try {\n                peer.transportListener.onException(new TransportDisposedIOException(\"peer (\" + this + \") stopped.\"));\n            } catch (Exception ignore) {\n            }\nIn some cases(high load, slow servers, etc.)  due to race condition peer.transportListener is not initialized yet on a moment of stopping so it leads to NPE (which will be just ignored) and corresponded VMTransport is not destroyed. \n\nThe issue can be fixed by attached patch.
