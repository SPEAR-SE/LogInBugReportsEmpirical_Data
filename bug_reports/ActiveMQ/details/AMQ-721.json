I don't recommend this as the solution going forward, but it appears to work on my test cases (which failed before I implemented it).  \n\nFirst we need to change the dotNet dll client classes.\nin class IMessageConsumer, add a new function:\n\nIMessage AutoAcknowledge(IMessage message);\n\nin class MessageConsumer, make AutoAcknowledge public rather then protected.\n\nThen, create your dll.\n\nNow, in your test app do the following:\n\nLet's assume you've created a consumer called \"consumer\" and have defined the following:\nconsumer.Listener += new MessageListener(onMessage);\n\nset up the listener function as follows:\npublic void onMessage(IMessage message)\n{\n     If (consumer != null) //just a good idea to check\n         consumer.AutoAcknowledge(message);\n     // whatever you want to do with your message goes here... I've just put a Console.WriteLine here, but do whatever you want here\n    Console.WriteLine(\"got Message:  \" + ((ActiveMQTextMessage)message).Text);\n}\n\nThis isn't an ideal solution, because it requires the MessageListener to call AutoAcknowledge, but it seems to work.  I hope this helps folks who are trying to do this!\n\nJamie","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=feldrax","name":"feldrax","key":"feldrax","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Stanton","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-06-20T03:57:25.000+0000","updated":"2006-06-20T03:57:25.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481878/comment/12937842","id":"12937842","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=feldrax","name":"feldrax","key":"feldrax","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"James Stanton","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Oh, sorry, one more thing.
