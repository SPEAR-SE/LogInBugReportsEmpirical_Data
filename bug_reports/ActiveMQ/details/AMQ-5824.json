His scenario's a little unique because he uses far more destinations (and far more consumers) than most installations, but it still highlighted a potential performance improvement.\n\nHe proposed that we keep a Map<ConsumerInfo, Subscription> (does it need to be a Multimap?) in addition to the Map<Subscription, ObjectName> so we can quickly find the Subscription or Subscriptions for the given ConsumerInfo.\n\nNote that even using a concurrent collection won't synchronize between the two nor synchronize with logic that tests the existence of an element in the collection and then acts accordingly.  subscriptionMap already has this problem, so simply using a concurrent Map/Multimap without doing additional synchronization may not make it worse, but we really should evaluate whether we need explicit synchronization rather than relying on the concurrent collection as the sole means of synchronization.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Improve performance of ManagedRegionBroker.removeConsumer()","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tbain98","name":"tbain98","key":"tbain98","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim Bain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tbain98","name":"tbain98","key":"tbain98","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim Bain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5824/votes","votes":1,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2fksv:"}}
