Both of the servers want to produce/consume messages to/from this topic.\n\nThe config looks like this:\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<!DOCTYPE beans PUBLIC  \"-//ACTIVEMQ//DTD//EN\" \"http://activemq.org/dtd/activemq.dtd\">\n<beans>\n  <broker>\n    <connector>\n      <tcpServerTransport uri=\"tcp://SERVER1:61616\" backlog=\"1000\" useAsyncSend=\"true\" maxOutstandingMessages=\"50\"/>\n    </connector>    \n    <networkConnector>      \n      <networkChannel uri=\"reliable:tcp://SERVER2:61616\" remoteBrokerName=\"whocares\"/>    \n    </networkConnector>    \n    <persistence>      \n      <vmPersistence/>    \n    </persistence>   \n  </broker>\n</beans>\n\nInitial setup is fine, and upon starting both servers they connect and happily message with each other. However, problems arise if one of the servers is restarted or if a network outage occurs.\n\nIf one server (SERVER1, say) is stopped and restarted, reconnection occurs but messages are then received twice by the other server (SERVER2 - the one that was not stopped).  The activeMQ logging I get from SERVER2 on reconnect is:\n\n14:56:16,765 channel status changed: Channel: tcp://192.168.1.171:61616 has reconnected\n14:56:16,890 Adding new client: ID:elephant-3033-1132757775296-0:0_NetworkChannel on transport: TcpTransportChannel: Socket[addr=/192.168.1.172,port=3035,localport=61615]\n\nbut after this all messages are received once on SERVER1 and twice on SERVER2.\nI could just about live with that, but...\n\n...if both servers are running but encounter a network outage (ie. I disable then re-enable the network of one machine) I get one of two situations:\n1) Both servers appear to reconnect, but neither one receives *any* messages any more, or\n2) The servers reconnect, but upon one server posting to the topic, both are sent into an infinite loop receiving the same message for ever. \n\nI've attached an eclipse project with some simple test classes.

The clients publish and subscribe to a single topic.\n\nAgain the problem that occurs is that if brokerB is shut down and then restarted, clientA will then start receiving two copies of each message that it publishes.\n\nWhat I did, though, was to add a reconnectSleepTime attribute to broker A's <networkChannel> element and set the value to 10000 (10 seconds). The default value is 2000. What happens when I run this way is that if I stop brokerB and immediately restart it, for a while clientA behaves correctly, i.e., it only gets one copy of the message. After about 10 seconds (when brokerA reconnects to brokerB), then clientA will start getting double messages.\n\nHope this provides some sort of clue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmccobra","name":"dmccobra","key":"dmccobra","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David McCullough","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-02-04T03:57:00.000+0000","updated":"2006-02-04T03:57:00.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481647/comment/12937409","id":"12937409","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mihalich","name":"mihalich","key":"mihalich","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Joe Mihalich","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"\n   Hi, we are also seeing this problem...and is holding up our deployment now.
