This happens as the following:\r\n # one client create a queue and sends a message.\r\n # Network partition such that the master broker will not be able to communicate with all other nodes (including Zookeeper nodes)\r\n # one client consumes the message from the master successfully (before the master detects that it does not have a majority of nodes and steps down).\r\n # after electing new master by the other two nodes, another client consumes the same message successfully\r\n\r\nWe think that is a bug and should not happen.
