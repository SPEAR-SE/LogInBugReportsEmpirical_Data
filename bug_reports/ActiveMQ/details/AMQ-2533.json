with OutOfMemory.\n\nOutOfMemory analysis shows:\n- 3372 instances of org.apache.activemq.command.ActiveMQTopic occupying 23,7%\nNames of Topic contain ActiveMQ.Advisory.FULL.Topic:\n- ActiveMQ.Advisory.FULL.Topic.ActiveMQ.Advisory.FULL.Topic.ActiveMQ.Advisory.FULL.....ActiveMQ.Advisory.Producer.Topic.OFBTopic\n\n1069 instances of org.apache.activemq.thread.DedicatedTaskRunner$1 holding 12% through the names of the thread that are soooooo long.\n\nDebuging ActiveMQ, I noticed that AMQ didn't check when sending advisory messages that advisory concerns an advisory.\nExample, suppose you set a listener for advisory message ActiveMQ.Advisory.FULL.Topic.OFBTopic and this listener becomes slow for a reason, then AMQ will send an advisory on this advisory provoking more and more traffic \non the broker only for this advisory.\n\nI attached a Stack Trace showing that an advisory will be sent for the advisory.\n\nI will be checking to see if this issue also exists on 5.3.0.\nThanks in advance.\nPhilippe.\nhttp://www.ubik-ingenierie.com","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461338","id":"12461338","filename":"activemq.xml","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=pmouawad","name":"pmouawad","key":"pmouawad","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Philippe
