here:\r\n\r\n[https://github.com/CodeMettle/amq_null_body_repro]\r\n\r\nOriginally I thought this had to do with concurrently accessing getText() on a message but the VM transport should copy the message to each consumer before dispatch so something else seems to be going on.\r\n\r\nIt's possible that there's something specific to the test case (ie a bug in the client code) or an issue in the broker that causes the null message body but this needs to be looked at closer to determine the problem.\r\n\r\nAlso, as a side note, there is no specific synchronization in the client message objects as they are supposed to be used in a single thread which is why they are copied on dispatch if using the VM transport.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ActiveMQText
