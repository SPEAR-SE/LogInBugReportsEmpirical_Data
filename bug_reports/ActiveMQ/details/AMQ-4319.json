accumulate.\n\nsecurityContext.getAuthorizedReadDests().put(info.getDestination(), info.getDestination());\n\nthe fix is probably in org.apache.activemq.security.AuthorizationBroker#removeDestination, where we need to remove the destination from the auth map of all connections.\n\norg.apache.activemq.security.SimpleAuthenticationPluginTest would be a simple place to add a test case, once the gcInactive is added to org/apache/activemq/security/simple-auth-broker.xml\n\ncreating producers/consumers to USERS.1-1000 and having them gced and checking jvm stack usage should expose the problem
