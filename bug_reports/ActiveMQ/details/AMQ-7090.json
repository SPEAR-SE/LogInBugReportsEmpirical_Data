One of those consumers crashed prior to acknowledging a message and was automatically restarted. It got the message again, crashed again, etc... Since this was an unmonitored test-environment, it had restarted several million times ;)\r\n\r\nThe crash isn't really relevant here, but we wanted to prevent this from happening again. TheÂ  [redelivery pluging|http://activemq.apache.org/message-redelivery-and-dlq-handling.html] seemed to be a match; configure it to send messages over a certain redelivery count to the DLQ and we'd be done.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, it doesn't seem to work. With the attached configuration we connected a test-consumer that would never acknowledge a message, sent a message and killed the test-consumer. Repeating this beyond the configured maximumRedeliveries had no effect, we kept getting the same message. Via the web-interface, we could see it was clearly keeping track of those redeliveries though.\r\n\r\nSomewhat related, the whole redelivery-configuration seems to be irrelevant, the message was available on the queue right away, without any of the 'backoff' and 'delay' visible.\r\n\r\nSo summarized steps to reproduce:\r\n * Configure ActiveMQ according to the documentation with redeliveryPlugin\r\n * Connect to a queue with a consumer (with Stomp?) that will not acknowledge a message, but will display what it got\r\n * Send a message\r\n * Disconnect/kill consumer\r\n * Reconnect the test consumer\r\n * Repeat previous to see it keeps getting the same message","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12946777","id":"12946777","filename":"activemq.xml","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acm","name":"acm","key":"acm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arjen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2018-11-03T08:08:05.998+0000","size":5079,"mimeType":"text/xml","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12946777/activemq.xml"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Message keeps being redelivered to new connections, regardless of policy","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acm","name":"acm","key":"acm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arjen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acm","name":"acm","key":"acm","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Arjen","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Ubuntu 18.04 host with ActiveMQ 5.15.7.
