Also any application that deals with huge volume is going to use a connection pool that also pools the statements, which means that the statement you created are referenced by the pool, thus they won't be garbage collected and closed. Just like the connection.close triggers the connection to be marked as available in the pool, statement.close will trigger the statement to be available in the pool for whoever needs a statement for this connection.\nAs a result of running out of statements, DefaultDatabaseLocker causes Oracle to throw an exception \"maximum open cursors exceeded\". And the broker looses the DB lock and shuts down.\n\nOne solution would be to add a finally block onto the DefaultDatabaseLocker.keepAlive() method to close statement explicitly.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"233381","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"DefaultDatabaseLocker causes Oracle to throw an exception \"maximum open cursors exceeded\" under heavy load","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482095/comment/12939618","id":"12939618","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fixed by SVN revision 652302","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-30T06:45:29.957+0000","updated":"2008-04-30T06:45:29.957+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1702/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i14bu7:"}}
