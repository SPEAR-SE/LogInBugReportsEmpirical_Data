No change here.  See above for test setup and description.\n\nNow I'll speculate based on 3 test cases I've been running.\nSay I publish 100 messages to a q. \nThen I start a slow consumer (subscriber to the q) via stomp, so it reads little by little.\nNow I start a second consumer (subscriber, same q)\nThat second client will get ZERO messages.\n\nSo what I think might be happening is that STOMP connector is not really integrated into the broker, it wakes up when that first client comes in and grabs all 100 messages.  Then when the second client comes in there are none left for it to get.\n\nThen if that first client dies or even stops gracefully, somehow those 100 messages are allocated to the stomp connecter that was talking on that specific tcp/ip socket.  all 100 of those messages seem to be \"consumed\" from the brokers point of view and cannot be made available to any other STOMP clients.  Even thought the actual STOMP client has only gotten say 7 of them across the TCP/IP connection (3 second sleep loop after each message) the stomp connecter representing it has grabbed them all from the broker and is hoarding them and won't share, and won't put them back if that socket connection is closed.\n\nKeep in mind I know nothing about the internals of JMS brokers, this is speculation based on a combination of 3 test scenarios but it would explain all 3 mis-behaviours that I am seeing. \n\nJoel

I think this is due to the socket being killed but the server side not noticing.  But it will notice once it tries to send it a message, so the it shutdown the dead socket and redelivers all messages queued for the client.  On some OSes the TCP timeout interval can be tweaked.  Otherwise, keep alive packets would need to be periodically transmitted in Stomp so that the server could detect a dead client sooner.
