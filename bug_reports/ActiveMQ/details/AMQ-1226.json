Let's assume the last message received was number 11.\n\n4) Restart the subscriber.\n\n5) First several messages can be in reverse order.

These messages must be placed at the beginning of the \"pending\" list because the dispatched messages are chronologically before the pending messages already in the list.  The deactivate method iterates over the \"dispatched\" list and adds each message to the beginning of the \"pending\" list one at a time.  This reverses the order of the messages.\n\nIf the messages in question get written to JDBC, the problem can be hidden because the messages get queried in the correct order.\n\nIf the prefetch size is set to 1 the problem does not present because there will only be 1 message in the \"dispatched\" list.\n\nSolution:\nIn the deactivate method, iterate the \"dispatched\" list in reverse order.\n\nPatch against 4.1.1 attached.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12460647","id":"12460647","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--patchfile.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dvain","name":"dvain","key":"dvain","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dustin Vain","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2007-04-10T23:55:16.714+0000","size":1248,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12460647/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--patchfile.txt"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161812","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"durable topic messages received in reverse order after consumer restart","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dvain","name":"dvain","key":"dvain","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dustin Vain","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dvain","name":"dvain","key":"dvain","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dustin Vain","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux (Suse 9.3 and Gentoo), WinXP, JDK 1.5.0","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482641/comment/12940122","id":"12940122","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"This behaviour has been fixed in 5.2 -
