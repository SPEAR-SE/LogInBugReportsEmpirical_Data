One of our tests which uses binding of *PooledConnectionFactory* into JNDI (tomcat-naming) got *stuck* and computes *in endless loop*.\n\nProblem is implementation of interface {{org.apache.activemq.jndi.JNDIStorableInterface}} in class {{org.apache.activemq.pool.PooledConnectionFactory}}:\n- method {{populateProperties(Properties props)}} implementation uses {{IntrospectionSupport.getProperties(...)}} in order to set properties for all getters,\n- setting properties works for basic types, but causes stack overflow for getters - {{getReference()}} and {{getProperties()}} which creates recursion loops\n- loop #1: PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.populateProperties -> IntrospectionSupport.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties\n- loop #2: PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.populateProperties -> IntrospectionSupport.getProperties -> PooledConnectionFactory.getReference -> JNDIReferenceFactory.createReference -> PooledConnectionFactory.getProperties\n- additional info: recursion loop doesn't end with StackOverflowError, but InvocationTargetException is propagated to IntrospectionSupport.getProperties method where it is being ignored and causes \"almost endless\" computation (exponential complexity)\n\nExample test without using JNDI, but using key methods showing the problem and its possible solution/workaround for AMQ 5.10.0 is attached.\n\nWe found that error exists for AMQ 5.9.0 and newer after resolving
