As a proof, the {{activemq-client.jar}} does not contain the STOMP transport.\n\nIs it something that could change?\n\nIf indeed STOMP is fully supported in {{activemq-client.jar}} then I would be happy to contribute and improve the classes under {{org/apache/activemq/transport/stomp}}.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lionel.cons","name":"lionel.cons","key":"lionel.cons","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lionel Cons","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2015-11-05T06:29:48.768+0000","updated":"2015-11-05T06:29:48.768+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12910334/comment/14991676","id":"14991676","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
