I was already having the problem with activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar and when I downloaded the zip I only checked the activemq-all directory which only contains a pom.  That makes sense in that it appears to be a combination of other jars.  \n\nSo is it intentional that you don't include any source code in activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar?  If so that is fine.  I'm guilty of not researching this issue enough before writing it up.  I found another issue (AMQ-5193), in which I noticed that java files started showing up in the regular (non-source) jar file in 5.9.0, so when I noticed there was no source in your 5.8.0 I *assumed* that something was amiss in your \"build\".  If it is intentional that activemq-all-5.8.0-sources.jar contains no java files, then I apologize for wasting your time and you can close the issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=johnnyclark","name":"johnnyclark","key":"johnnyclark","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johnny Clark","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-05-21T15:39:57.593+0000","updated":"2014-05-21T15:39:57.593+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12715564/comment/14004829","id":"14004829","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"only the parent source bundle is intended to contain source, the others will be empty.
