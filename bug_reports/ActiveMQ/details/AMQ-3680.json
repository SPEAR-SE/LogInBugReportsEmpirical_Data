Since those other uses of the underlying connection can be held indefinitely, or - on a very active system - there might be almost no time when there are no users of a connection, those temporary destinations essentially create a leak.\n\nThe most correct operation would remove the temporary destination for each PooledConnection when it's close() method is called.\n\nPrior to AMQ-3457, updates for AMQ-2349 attempted to resolve this problem, but ended up being overly-aggressive, removing all of the temporary destinations from the underlying connection.  So, one PooledConnection's close() deleted temporary destinations for multiple PooledConnection objects which were still active.\n\nTest case and patch will be
