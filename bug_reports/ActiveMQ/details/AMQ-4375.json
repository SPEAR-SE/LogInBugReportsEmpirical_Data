Earls","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I don't think we can resolve this as long as we are using the QPID client, because starting a connection in QPID is not fully synchronous. connection.start() creates a org.apache.qpid.amqp_1_0.jms.impl.ConnectionImpl, which in turn creates a creates a org.apache.qpid.amqp_1_0.client.Connection. This Connection creates a ConnectionEndpoint in its constructor and then calls open() on that.\n\nConnectionEndpoint.open() sends the open packet to the server. However, it doesn't wait for a response. It sets _state = ConnectionState.AWAITING_OPEN and returns. (The response from the server ends up getting handled by the thread named inputThread that Connection also creates in its constructor).\n\nThis can create a short race condition, which doesn't matter most places. I think it's a problem here because it takes longer for the server to create a connection when using SSL, and the test cases in UnifiedSessionTests aren't really doing very much. For example, for testCreateDurableConnectionConsumerOnQueueConnection it creates a QueueConnection in setUp(), calls QueueConnection.createDurableConnectionConsumer() which immediately throws an IllegalStateException, and then hangs trying to close the QueueConnection in tearDown(). As far as I can tell the test ends up calling close() on the connection before it's finished opening, and the result is a deadlock.\n\nAll of the tests pass if I add a short sleep to the setup to allow the connections to finish opening, but I don't think we can do that with the JoramJmsTests.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kearls","name":"kearls","key":"kearls","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=kearls&avatarId=16572","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=kearls&avatarId=16572","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=kearls&avatarId=16572","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=kearls&avatarId=16572"},"displayName":"Kevin
