Currently, such TransportConnection IOException(s) are handled and logged on the WARN level when actually they are harmless as the broker is shutting down. For one such example, please consider the following code blocks from  activemq-5.10.0:\n\nactivemq\\activemq-broker\\src\\main\\java\\org\\apache\\activemq\\broker\\TransportConnection.java\n\nLines 933 - 937\n\ntry {\n     broker.preProcessDispatch(messageDispatch);\n} catch (RuntimeException convertToIO) {\n     throw new IOException(convertToIO);\n}\n\nWhen this block throws the IOException, it is caught and further thrown from \n\nLines 941 - 951\n\n} catch (IOException e) {\n     if (messageDispatch != null) {\n          TransmitCallback sub = messageDispatch.getTransmitCallback();\n           broker.postProcessDispatch(messageDispatch);\n           if (sub != null) {\n                sub.onFailure();\n           }\n           messageDispatch = null;\n           throw e;\n     }\n}\n\nWhen this block throws the exception, it is further caught and serviced by\n\nLines 989 - 995\n\n} catch (IOException e) {\n     if (dispatchStopped.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n          dispatchStoppedLatch.countDown();\n     }\n     serviceExceptionAsync(e);\n     return false;\n}\n\nLines 267 - 276 (serviceExceptionAsync) create a new \"Async Exception Handler\" thread which will invoke serviceException\n\nLines 287 - 289\n\nif (e instanceof IOException) {\n     serviceTransportException((IOException) e);\n}\n\nThis will evaluate to true and hence serviceTransportException is invoked\n\nLines 242 - 246\n\nif (TRANSPORTLOG.isDebugEnabled()) {\n     TRANSPORTLOG.debug(this + \" failed: \" + e, e);\n} else if (TRANSPORTLOG.isWarnEnabled() && !expected(e)) {\n     TRANSPORTLOG.warn(this + \" failed: \" + e);\n}\n\nIf debug is enabled, then it is OK for all IOExceptions to be logged. However, in the \"else if\" case, it is not considered if this TransportConnection IOException is being handled while the broker is shutting down. The suggestion is to consider the value of this.broker.getBrokerService().isStopping() as part of the expected(e) call to limit the amount of benign WARN messages that can show up in the log and cause confusion as the broker is shutting down.\n\nA patch for this fix will be provided.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12686967","id":"12686967","filename":"AMQ5488.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=patanasov","name":"patanasov","key":"patanasov","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Pero
