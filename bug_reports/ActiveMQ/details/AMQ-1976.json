My problem is reproducing the behavior.\nmessages that passe through a network are acked one by one. The error is telling us that the ack is ocurring out of order; since the message was dispatched, 730 other messages have been dispatched and it looks like the ack is for the 730th message. It is a valid ack though.\nI think this can only happen in asyncSend, otherwise, each dispatched message is synchronously acked through to its next hop.\n\nIdeally, it would be great if you could produce a test case.
