The reason for this is the DemandForwardingBridge runs the remove consumer code in a separate thread. But if a \"remove destination\" advisory messages comes in, it will remove the destination from the AdvisoryBroker's destination map. So if this happens before the code for removeConsumer runs (in AdvisoryBroker), then the destination will not be in the destination map and the advisory for removeConsumer will not fire.\n\nThe net result is a subscription leak in the network bridge on B & C\n\nThe junit test shows two issues:\n\n1) the subscriptions leaked when concurrent producers using request/reply and correctly closing the consumer and connection\n2) all subscriptions leaked when using a single producer with request/reply and closing only the connection, and not the consumer explicitly\n\nIssue 2 is related to temp destinations only and is compounded by \nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3879","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"163762","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race condition between removal of subscriptions and removal of destinations in a network of brokers","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618151/comment/13506462","id":"13506462","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The deletion of temp destinations before close cause a problem when there are active consumers.

There is a thread for the topic, but it's used for dispatching messages that were set aside because of producer flow control when sent with a producer window or sent synchronous. That's the only purpose for that thread. It does not dispatch the messages in normal cases. Even in the PFC case, it will not race because the Usage#usageMutex would allow the messages waiting for space to fire first before any new messages are sent.\n\nHowever, I agree to the extent that consumers to temporary destinations should be tied to the life of the temporary destination (whether a network sub or real sub). In other words, if somehow there is a consumer for a temp dest around when the temp dest is being removed, then that consumer too should be removed. \n\nI think Gary's patch will enforce this at the bridge level, but further assurances should be fine.\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ceposta","name":"ceposta","key":"ceposta","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=ceposta&avatarId=15051"},"displayName":"Christian Posta","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2012-12-04T18:26:32.133+0000","updated":"2012-12-04T18:26:32.133+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618151/comment/13509938","id":"13509938","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"So, the brokers guarantee ordering across more than 1 Topic?\n\nThe following can never happen - even if PFC is hit on on Topic?\n\n- subscription S to composite ActiveMQ.Advisory.TempTopic,ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.>\n- message A produced to ActiveMQ.Advisory.TempTopic\n- message B produced to ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.ID:xyz\n- message B consumed by S\n- message A consumed by S\n\nIn other words, once the ActiveMQ.Advisory.TempTopic destination hits PFC, dispatches to ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.ID:xyz will block as well?\n\nThis is starting to shed light on potential circumstances under which I was seeing more out-or-order processing issues.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2012-12-04T18:49:27.331+0000","updated":"2012-12-04T18:49:27.331+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12618151/comment/13509954","id":"13509954","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"@Arthur - please build the test case.
