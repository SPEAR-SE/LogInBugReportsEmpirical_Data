The dups will be delivered though, if there is another failover (a common case for system upgrades). It seems like a single consumer will not get duplicates, even if it fails over again to new broker, but if the consumer is restarted, it loses it's state as well, and subsequently gets the duplicates delivered.\n\nAttached is a testcase that demonstrates the problem. It shows that with a single producer doing commits after each send, it creates on additional message in the broker with a duplicate MSGID_SEQ. If everything is committed in one transaction, then every single message in the transaction is duplicated (and not only the ones before the failover occurred).\n\nThe testcase uses an external MySQL instance though, and needs the DBCP and the MySQL JDBC connector on the classpath (the pom is patched in the attached file to resolve that automatically).\nOut of the 6 tests, the following almost always fail on my machine:\n\ntestProducer_MasterFailoverByShutdown_AtRandomTimes_CommitPerMessage  (expected <6000>, but was <6001>)\ntestProducer_MasterFailoverByShutdown_AtRandomTimes_OneCommit  (expected <6000>, but was <12000>)\n\nRarely (3-5% of the cases) this one also fails:\ntestProducer_MasterFailoverByShutdown_SingleMsgCommit_AfterCommit  (expected <500>, but was <501>)\n\n\nOther observations made:\n1) The problem seems to be a race condition because while trying to find the cause through debugging, the problem disapeared when setting a break point in TransactionInfo.visit(line:100). The race condition is met on my machine (specs above) basically all the time without interaction (from maven, on the shell with a build, inside eclipse debugged and normal).\n2) It seems that TransactionBroker.commitTransaction(line:100) is called once with duplicated synchronizations (2x size). On the other hand MemoryTransactionStore$Tx(line:109) is called twice with the correct amount first, and later a doubled amount.\n3) The problem is not reproducible with Kaha, the problem is related to JDBC.\n4) It might be possible to have the testcase fail reliably with one of Derby/HSQL/H2, but I didn't investigate.\n5) The testcase is not exactly very pretty, but it does show the problem ;)\n6) The attached testcase is a patch against activemq-core.\n7) The tests can be executed directly (in bash) with:\nenv MAVEN_OPTS=\"$MAVEN_OPTS -Xmx800M\" mvn -Dtest=org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransactionalTest test\n8) For MySQL the following should work: \nSELECT \n      MSGID_PROD\n     ,MSGID_SEQ\n  FROM activemq_msgs\nGROUP BY MSGID_PROD,MSGID_SEQ\nHAVING ( COUNT(MSGID_SEQ) > 1 );\n\n9) if you need the my.cnf for the database, I can attach that as well.\n10) The tables are correctly created as InnoDB\n\nI think that's it...","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461554","id":"12461554","filename":"FailoverTransactionalTest.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dmueller","name":"dmueller","key":"dmueller","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Daniel
