Run TestSubscriber to create a queue named TestQueue.\n2. Observe in JConsole that queue TestQueue and advisory topic ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Queue.TestQueue now exist.\n3. In JConsole invoke removeQueue on the BrokerViewMBean with the parameter TestQueue.\n4. Observe the queue TestQueue is removed, but the advisory topic ActiveMQ.Advisory.Consumer.Queue.TestQueue still exists.\n\nThis also happens when invoking BrokerViewMBean.removeQueue programatically.  There are no message sent over TestQueue in the steps above, but this also appears to happen after messages have been sent over the
