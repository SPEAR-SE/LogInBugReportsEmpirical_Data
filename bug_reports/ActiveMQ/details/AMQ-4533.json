the message to RECEIPT_QUEUE, 10 other listeners on RECEIPT_QUEUE consume and counts them.\n\nWe tried making one of the consumer slow by setting the \nprocessing time to 100000 seconds (sleep) and putting a heavy load in \n500 threads every 1 ms to some other queues the same time.\n\nOur test case is attached, you might need to install some dependencies \nto the local maven repository manually:\n\n     mvn install:install-file -DgroupId=org.apache.activemq \n-DartifactId=activemq-core -Dversion=5.7.0-fuse-71-047 -Dpackaging=jar \n-Dfile=activemq-core-5.7.0.fuse-71-047.jar\n     mvn

use the Maven test target:\n\n    mvn clean test\n\nIf the problem occurs the you'll get a message like this in the test \nresults, (target/surefire-reports):\n\n    java.lang.AssertionError: Still

It simulates slow cusomer, with threads hung, or a slow database operation. Without this slow consumer, the test completes very fast, and we don't see the problem. \n\nThe test simulates the production environment where the broker is under heavy load. In the test case there is heavy load on SOME_TEST_QUEUE, all of which uses separate connections pools, message listeners, and latches. Whereas the critical messages for the test case are on INPUT_QUEUE, and RECEIPT_QUEUE, which use OtherMessageListener, and onOtherMessageLatch.\n\nThis test case is the only evidence of a problem which has been plaguing our production environment for years.\n\nHere is how the TC works:\n\n1) start AMQ brokers\n\n2) start spring consumer for consumming from INPUT_QUEUE and putting receipts to RECEIPT_QUEUE\nThis consumer is processing first message for ever.\n\t   if (isStuckOld!=isStuck) {\n\t        log4jLogger.info(\"sleep for eternity\");\n\t        Thread.sleep(100000000);\n                 }\t\nand next 49 messages longer /30 seconds/ than rest of 1000 msgs.\n\n\tif (nrProcessed<50) {\n\t\t\tThread.sleep(30000);\n\t}\n\nThe reason for it is to simulate some slow & stuck consumers which we can notice on production.\n\n3) run heavy traffic to SOME.TEST.QUEUE \na) put 1000000 messages using 50 threads to broker 1\n\nsendInThreads(QUEUE_NAME, 500000, 50, DeliveryMode.NON_PERSISTENT,getUrl1(),1);\nsendInThreads(QUEUE_NAME, 500000, 50, DeliveryMode.PERSISTENT,getUrl1(),1);\n\nb) get 900000 messages in 200 listening threads from broker 2 using OtherMessageListener\n\nlistenInThreads(QUEUE_NAME, 900000, 200,getUrl2(), mListener, otherConnections);\n\nHowever we do not wait on latches as it is not important. This is traffic to simulate heavy load only - not necessary to count them.\n\n4) send traffic to INPUT_QUEUE in 10 threads on broker 1 which triggers our spring consumer from step 2 to start consuming and to send output messages to RECEIPT_QUEUE /one receipt message sent to RECEIPT_QUEUE for one message consumed from INPUT_QUEUE/.\n\n        \tCountDownLatch latch1=sendInThreads(queueName, msgCount, threadCount, persistance,getUrl1(),500);\n\nThe latch1 is checked later in the step 6 to ensure we had all 1000 messages sent there.\n\n5) listen on RECEIPT_QUEUE in 10 threads on broker 2 using MainMessageListener with onMainMessageLatch set to 999 /one message should be stuck on consummer forever by TC design/\n\n            CountDownLatch latch=listenInThreads(queueName, msgCount, threadCount,getUrl2(),msgListener,connections);\n\n6) wait for latches - because of heavy load we had to set the timeout long enough /here 1000 seconds/ to give the system the chance to process all messages from INPUT_QUEUE /the processing might be very slow because of heavy load/\n\t\t\tonMainMessageLatch.await(1000, TimeUnit.SECONDS);\nand also we check if all messages were put into INPUT_QUEUE for processing\n\t\t\tlatch1.await(msgCount/10, TimeUnit.SECONDS); // .MINUTES\n\n7) check assertions for INPUT_QUEUE and RECEIPT_QUEUE - they should be empty\n\n\t\t    queueName = INPUT_QUEUE;\n            \n            queueSize1=queueSize(brokerService1, queueName);\n            queueSize2=queueSize(brokerService2, queueName);            \n            \n            Assert.assertEquals(\"Still messages in \"+queueName,0, queueSize1+queueSize2);\n\t\t\t\n\t\t    queueName = RECEIPT_QUEUE;\n            \n            queueSize1=queueSize(brokerService1, queueName);\n            queueSize2=queueSize(brokerService2, queueName);            \n            \n            Assert.assertEquals(\"Still messages in \"+queueName,0, queueSize1+queueSize2);\t\t\t\n\n\n8) close AMQ brokers\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jshepher","name":"jshepher","key":"jshepher","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Shepherd","active":true,"timeZone":"Australia/Brisbane"},"created":"2013-06-05T00:07:18.928+0000","updated":"2013-06-05T00:17:53.958+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12647406/comment/13679662","id":"13679662","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"more cleanups inside the test, less spring dependence.

We could tune the prefetch for every queue but anyway we might really need some good working timeout for aborting such consumers /to release all prefetched messages to it/. For now the timeout is related to slow consumers only and depends on difficult mechanism of slowness detecting which does not work if there are not enough messages coming to a queue for some time. So most likely it is still necessary to have a new checking mechanism whether a consumer is still consuming messages or not.

In the case of having the abortConnection=true this means that you'd have consumer connection coming and going for no real reason which could impact performance of your application.  I don't see why you'd want to not just ignore the idle one's and only focus on consumers that have not ack'd outstanding messages in the allocated time.

It doesn't use message listener like you would in a JMS app. Instead it does receive() on the session, gets the message and manually executes onMessage() on the listener. In auto acknowledge mode as soon as receive() is done, the message is acked and considered processed. So the message that sleeps forever will not be resent to other consumers when this consumer is detected slow. Turning to client acknowlement Spring actually manually acks the message when onMessage() completes. So when we close the consumer, the current long-sleeping message will be replayed to other consumers.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-09-19T08:54:06.333+0000","updated":"2013-09-19T08:54:06.333+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12647406/comment/13771808","id":"13771808","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=wdudek","name":"wdudek","key":"wdudek","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Wieslaw Dudek","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thank you for your comment!\nWe do not care about the long-sleeping message but about all the prefetched messages for the sleeping consumer which needs to be redispatched & delivered to other consumers.
