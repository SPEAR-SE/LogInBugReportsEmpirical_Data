Put a persistent message onto queue A.\n2. A consumer (using XA transactions) receives the message. The consumer always throws an exception, so after predefined number of redelivery attempts the message goes to ActiveMQ.DLQ.\n3. Using web console move the message from ActiveMQ.DLQ back to queue A.\n4. Consumer receives the message and again throws exceptions in its onMessage method. \n4a. Expected behaviour: message lands on ActiveMQ.DLQ again.\n4b. Actual behaviour: message dissappears - it's neither on queue A nor ActiveMQ.DLQ.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"336715","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Message moved from ActiveMQ.DLQ to another queue can be lost","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maroos","name":"maroos","key":"maroos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marek Strejczek","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maroos","name":"maroos","key":"maroos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marek Strejczek","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12656116/comment/13699473","id":"13699473","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=maroos","name":"maroos","key":"maroos","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Marek Strejczek","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Workaround exists:\nDon't use web console 'move' option to replay a message from ActiveMQ.DLQ.
