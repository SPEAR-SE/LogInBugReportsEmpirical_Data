The ActiveMqSession.checkClosed() will throw the exception if the connection is lost. This is really an internal error which according to the javax.jms.Session.commit javadoc should result in a JMSException.\n\nThe distinction between the two exceptions becomes important when using Spring and ActiveMq. When doing JMS inside a codeblock that is managed by a HibernateTransactionManager (or any other non-JmsTransactionManager/non-JtaTransactionManager) TransactionSynchronizationUtils will try to commit the jms session after the HibernateTransactionManager has committed. This is done by calling the JmsResourceHolder.commitAll() from TransactionSynchronizationManager.invokeAfterCommit(). JmsResourceHolder.commitAll() will silently ignore IllegalStateExceptions as these are only supposed to happen in the case of a JTA transaction.\n\nIf ActiveMqSession.commit -> ActiveMqSession.checkClosed() were to throw a JMSException it would propagate out of the TransactionSynchronizationUtils and at least the application would be made aware that the JMSSession was not committed.\n\nBelow is the description of IllegalStateException from the JMS Specification:\nIllegalStateException: This exception is thrown when a method is invoked a\nan illegal or inappropriate time or if the provider is not in an appropriate \nstate for the requested operation. For example, this exception must be \nthrown if Session.commit() is called on a non-transacted session. This \nexception is also must be called when domain inappropriate method is \ncalled, such as calling TopicSession.CreateQueueBrowser().\n\nWhile it does not specifically state that a closed connection should _NOT_ throw an IllegalStateException, it would seem that throwing a JMSException is a better choice.
