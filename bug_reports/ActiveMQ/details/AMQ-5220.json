Stomp ProtocolConverter expects the stomp client to directly subscribe advisory addresses. So it will work when subscribing topic is prefixed with \"ActiveMQ.Advisory.\"\n2. Statistics plugin is kind of unique advisory system, as instead if directly subscribing advisory topic, you need to send a message with reply-to header. So when reply-to header and your reply topic has a name without \"ActiveMQ.Advisory.\" prefix, then it fails as translator finder is assuming that destination (or rather source) is not and advisory one. It simply ueses wrong frame translator. It thinks that it is a byte or string message while it is map message.\n\nSo this method is source of this issue:\n{code}\n    protected FrameTranslator findTranslator(String header, ActiveMQDestination destination) {\n        FrameTranslator translator = frameTranslator;\n        try {\n            if (header != null) {\n                translator = (FrameTranslator) FRAME_TRANSLATOR_FINDER\n                        .newInstance(header);\n            } else {\n                if (destination != null && AdvisorySupport.isAdvisoryTopic(destination)) {\n                    translator = new JmsFrameTranslator();\n                }\n            }\n        } catch (Exception ignore) {\n            // if anything goes wrong use the default translator\n        }\n\n        if (translator instanceof BrokerContextAware) {\n            ((BrokerContextAware)translator).setBrokerContext(brokerContext);\n        }\n\n        return translator;\n    }\n\n{code}\n\nSo I will try to prepare both: unit test and fix for this problem.\n\nGreetings\nPiotr
