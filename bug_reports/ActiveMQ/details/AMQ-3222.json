There have been some related efforts to resolve this, https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2981 and https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-2598. Parameters are stripped from transport uris and applied to both the transport and the discovery mechanism. \nThe end result, and fix, is that additional transport options that need to be applied to discovered transport (which typically have all query parameters removed) need to be isolated from normal query parameters using a dot (prefixed with \"discovered.\") notation. e.g:
