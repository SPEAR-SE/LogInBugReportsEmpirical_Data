This means that the next call to the start method of the pooled connection will not call start on the underlying connection even if in reality the connection is not started...\n\nIn my case, I use FailoverTransport but I want that my call to start returns after a certain delay so I interrupt the Thread that is starting the ActiveMQConnection. Doing that, the method returns but the isStarted method on the ActiveMQConnection returns false. The result is that all MessageDispatchChannel created on that connection are not started and don't dispatch message received.\n\nActiveMQConnection: \n   public void start() throws JMSException {\n        checkClosedOrFailed();\n        ensureConnectionInfoSent();           => The thread is interrupted here....\n        if (started.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n            for (Iterator<ActiveMQSession> i = sessions.iterator(); i.hasNext();) {\n                ActiveMQSession session = i.next();\n                session.start();\n            }\n        }\n    }\n\n\nThis is the solution that I propose and that seems to work for me:\nIn PooledConnection, replace:\n    public void start() throws JMSException {\n        if (started.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n            connection.start();\n        }\n    }\n\nby\n\n    public void start() throws JMSException {\n        started.compareAndSet(false, true);\n        if (!connection.isStarted()) {\n            connection.start();\n        }\n    }\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"59784","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Using connection pool, ActiveMQConnection is not started if an error occur during first attempt to start the connection.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mbaril","name":"mbaril","key":"mbaril","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mathieu Baril","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mbaril","name":"mbaril","key":"mbaril","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Mathieu Baril","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483648/comment/13118447","id":"13118447","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"This issue was fixed by AMQ-2677","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2011-09-30T21:10:31.446+0000","updated":"2011-09-30T21:10:31.446+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2326/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0alo7:"}}
