ActiveMQ sends a stomp frame, it may not send a heart-beat for up to almost 2x the negotiated interval.\n\nThe following test should illustrate the problem:\n\n{code}\nimport org.junit.Test;\n\nimport

{\n\t\t\tif (socket != null) {\n\t\t\t\tsocket.close();\n\t\t\t}\n\t\t\tbroker.stop();\n\t\t}\n\t}\n\n\tprivate BrokerService createAndStartBroker() throws Exception {\n\t\tBrokerService broker = new

sent:\n\n{noformat}\nTime since last read: 19994ms\n{noformat}\n\nIf I comment out the fail(â€¦) line in the test, after the first heartbeat taking almost 20000ms to be sent, things settle down and a heartbeat's received every 10000ms.\n\nIt looks like the write checker wakes up every 10000ms. The first time it wakes up, it notices that the CONNECTED frame was sent and does nothing. It then sleeps for a further 10000ms before checking again. As the CONNECTED frame was sent very early in the first 10000ms window, this leads to it taking almost 20000ms for the first heart-beat to be sent. From this point, as no further data frames are sent, the write checker wakes up and sends a heart-beat every 10000ms.\n\nIn short, I don't think ActiveMQ is adhering to the requirement that \"the sender MUST send new data over the network connection at least every <n> milliseconds\".","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12602339","id":"12602339","filename":"amq-4710.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paulgale","name":"paulgale","key":"paulgale","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Gale","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2013-09-10T13:56:11.973+0000","size":10844,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12602339/amq-4710.diff"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12929778","id":"12929778","filename":"AMQ-4710-double-heartbeat-frequency.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=lbarrett","name":"lbarrett","key":"lbarrett","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=lbarrett&avatarId=36073","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=lbarrett&avatarId=36073","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=lbarrett&avatarId=36073","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=lbarrett&avatarId=36073"},"displayName":"Leon Barrett","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2018-06-29T22:05:00.878+0000","size":4711,"mimeType":"text/x-patch","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12929778/AMQ-4710-double-heartbeat-frequency.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"346814","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"The first heart-beat after a connection becomes idle isn't sent as quickly as it should be","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=awilkinson","name":"awilkinson","key":"awilkinson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Wilkinson","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=awilkinson","name":"awilkinson","key":"awilkinson","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andy Wilkinson","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/London"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12666575/comment/13757072","id":"13757072","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=paulgale","name":"paulgale","key":"paulgale","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Paul Gale","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"This problem doesn't just happen on startup. \n\nI've been able to induce this behavior in the broker.
