of a race condition when using the async start option on an embedded broker. I ran the provided unit test, and noticed that the NPE did not appear when I added a short delay between starting the broker and then initiating the connection to the broker. Specifically, what happens is that the main thread attempts to connect to the broker before the broker start up thread has completed (i.e. the broker has set its broker service instance).\n\nI haven't diffed the 5.9 and 5.9.1 versions so I'm not sure what could have caused this to become a new issue.\n\nAs mentioned, I don't know much about the internal workings of ActiveMQ. However, as a suggestion, if the above is an accurate explanation of this issue, perhaps one possible fix would be to the TransportConnection class to wait until the broker has fully started to initiate the connection -- something along the lines of adding a \"while (!broker.getBrokerService().isStarted()) \" with that method already provided by the library.\n\nAny thoughts?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ndmar","name":"ndmar","key":"ndmar","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Nate M","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"created":"2014-05-11T09:09:47.021+0000","updated":"2014-05-11T09:09:47.021+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12710404/comment/13994526","id":"13994526","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"One way to start is to try and find the commit that broke what was apparently working before.

Consequently, the incoming VM transport will not wait for the specified period of time nor wait until the broker is started to proceed with initiating the connection. \n{code}\n            broker = registry.lookup(brokerName);\n            if (broker == null && waitForStart > 0) {\n                final long expiry = System.currentTimeMillis() + waitForStart;\n                while ((broker == null || !broker.isStarted()) && expiry > System.currentTimeMillis()) {\n{code}\nIt appears that perhaps 1) the broker registration in the registry should somehow be postponed until the end of the async startup, 2) the required broker references should be initialized before the async startup begins a version of which is done in James' workaround, or 3) the broker.isStarted() check can always be required in the lookupBroker method, not just when the broker can't yet be found in the registry.\n\nIncidentally, I saw a comment on an old ticket saying, \"Brokers agains start synchronously by default, which is needed for vm transport embedded case\"  (https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-3696).
