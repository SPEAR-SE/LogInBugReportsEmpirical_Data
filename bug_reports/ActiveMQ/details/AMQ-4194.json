When i post the messages to the queues, database table ACTIVEMQ_MSGS stores the message.\nBut,when I check my webconsole, I just see an empty table, no queue related information is shown up. \nWithout JDBC setup, I would be able to see the list of queues on my AMQ webconsole. Would want this to be the same with JDBC feature too.\nLooks like a bug to me. If not,kindly let me know if there are added configurations need to be done to set this right. Kindly throw more light on this issue. \nKindly let me know if you need more information to debug this
