However when trying to browse the queue using JMX, it returns null, despite the fact that not all msgs got dequeued yet (dispatch and dequeue counter < enqueue counter).\n\nSo far I reproduced this with a stomp producer/consumer only. The producer writes msgs to a virtual topic VirtualTopic.Foo and the consumer takes msgs off the Consumer.A.VirtualTopic.Foo queue. Using JMX I noticed all msgs got moved from the virtual topic to the queue (reflected by JMX enqueue counter) but not all msgs got consumed.\n\nSo it seems the broker lost some msgs on the way.
