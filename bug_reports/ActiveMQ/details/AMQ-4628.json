The column was blob and not indexed, and most of the queries for non-xa case uses \"AND XID IS NULL\" in the queries, which kills the performance on large tables.\n\nThe change was introduced to treat XID as String, and put it into indexed varchar column.\n\nIn my tests it made the broker work properly with close to 2 million messages.\n\nThe testing scenario:\n\n* Download the latest snapshot with the fix (or build locally) \n\n* I introduced a bit optimized configuration that turns off every non-essential feature, like expiry processing, database cleanup and priority messages. So start a broker with\n\n{code}bin/activemq console xbean:conf/activemq-jdbc-performance.xml{code}\n\n* Send large number of messages with\n\n{code}ant producer -Durl=tcp://localhost:61616 -DparallelThreads=10 -Dtransacted=true -Dsubject=BenchmarkQueue -Dmax=200000 -Ddurable=true -Dbatch=1000{code}\n\nNote that I added batch to work with producer tool, so we can send faster\n\n* Restart the broker to check broker startup time\n\n* Consumer messages with something like\n\n{code}ant consumer -Durl=tcp://localhost:61616 -DparallelThreads=10 -Dtransacted=true -Dsubject=BenchmarkQueue -Dmax=80000{code}\n\nI tested with local MySQL and it seems to work fine. It'd be good if people could test it with other RDBMS they use (Oracle, Postgres, etc.), to check if there's any other bottlenecks.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2013-07-11T14:20:12.472+0000","updated":"2013-07-11T14:20:12.472+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12657251/comment/13705880","id":"13705880","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"One thing though is that this schema is not compatible with the previous version if you're using XA transactions.
