I took your example and re-wrote it slightly with JUnit to demonstrate the issue and uploaded it as an attachment.   \n\n[~gtully], If you run the test case you will see that the statistics report back a message count of 2 instead of 1.  The issue here is pretty simple, it's on line 857 of the Queue class: https://github.com/apache/activemq/blob/master/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java#L857\n\nThe problem is the temp queue is part of a transaction, but since its store is null that if statement is always true so it executes the messageSent() method there and also again when the transaction completes which leads to the statistics updating twice.\n\nSeems like we could just delete the {{store == null}} part because I think any non temporary destination should always have a store.  Could also just change it to {{if ((store == null && !destination.isTemporary()) || (!context.isInTransaction() && !message.isPersistent()))}}\n\nBut I wanted to run it by you first to see what you think since you were the last person to have touched that line in this commit https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;a=commit;h=54e2e3bef290d7455d9d1ba3420d12dc4805b339","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.

The \"data/kahadb\" directory fills up with database log files, stopping the broker from working.\n\nWe have several clients using request-response where the response queue is a temporary queue. Each client has its own temporary queue which is reused for all requests during the lifetime of the client process, as recommended [by the ActiveMQ documentation|http://activemq.apache.org/how-should-i-implement-request-response-with-jms.html].\nWhen we look at the temp queues using hawtio we see that the _EnqueueCount_ is always two times the _DequeueCount_, even though no messages can be fetched from the queue, aka \"ghost\" messages.\n\nBecause of the seriousness of this issue I would consider this issue to be at least _Major_, not _Minor_ as it is today.\n\nIf we manually build ActiveMQ with this patch, then this issue goes away, but we would prefer to have an official release instead.\nWe would be very happy if a new release containing this fix could be prioritized.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=hakanj","name":"hakanj","key":"hakanj","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Håkan Johansson","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Stockholm"},"created":"2016-07-01T07:52:54.980+0000","updated":"2016-07-01T07:52:54.980+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12946537/comment/15358767","id":"15358767","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Commit 7ddfa97d0173b07346ea8fdfcb8e6545766e0d39 in activemq's branch refs/heads/activemq-5.13.x from [~cshannon]\n[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=7ddfa97 ]\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/AMQ-6194\n\nFixing an issue that caused statistics for a transactional temporary\nqueue to be updated twice by mistake.
