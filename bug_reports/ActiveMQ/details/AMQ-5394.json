The code in KahaDB logs a warning when this occurs from the following else statement and then updates the metadata location and then exits the function as shown below:\n\n...\n} else {\n            LOG.warn(\"Non existent message update attempt rejected. Destination: {}://{}, Message id: {}\", command.getDestination().getType(), command.getDestination().getName(), command.getMessageId());\n        }\nmetadata.lastUpdate = location;\n...\n\nIt turns out that the metadata.lastUpdate = location; line should not run if we took the else branch above so the simple fix is to move that line up into the if block so that it will not run after the log warning.  Once we did that, we no longer see the broker startup errors.  Note that this log warning does not always lead to a broker startup error as it is also related to writing at the end of a transaction log file or the checkpoint timer interval so it is not simple to reproduce but we have not see the startup error once the metadata.lastUpdate line was moved to the correct location.\n\nA patch will be provided to show the change.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12675318","id":"12675318","filename":"AMQ5394.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfugitt","name":"jfugitt","key":"jfugitt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesse Fugitt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-16T18:18:38.704+0000","size":3591,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12675318/AMQ5394.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12674775","id":"12674775","filename":"AMQ5394.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfugitt","name":"jfugitt","key":"jfugitt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesse Fugitt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"created":"2014-10-14T14:39:52.794+0000","size":1090,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12674775/AMQ5394.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Incorrect handling of duplicate update message commands in KahaDB can lead to broker startup errors","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfugitt","name":"jfugitt","key":"jfugitt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesse Fugitt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfugitt","name":"jfugitt","key":"jfugitt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesse Fugitt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12748048/comment/14173992","id":"14173992","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfugitt","name":"jfugitt","key":"jfugitt","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jesse Fugitt","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Chicago"},"body":"After further testing, it looks like the metadata.lastUpdate location in KahaDB is being set incorrectly in more places than just the function that handles update message (the add message and remove message functions also appear to have branches where this can happen).
