When tomcat stops, several transports receive an EOFException which causes the transports and the associated connections and consumers to stop.  If any of the consumers had unacknowledged messages, the messages are immediately dispatched to another consumer.  In some cases, the messages are dispatched to another consumer that is in the process of closing in response to one of the EOFExceptions.  This dispatch fails and causes the redelivery count for the message to be incremented one or more times even though the consumer couldn't possibly deliver the message to the client because its tcp connection is already closed.  \n\nMy MessageListener is ignoring messages with a redelivery count of 4 or higher because the messages are expensive to process.  In some cases, restarting the application server causes the message to be delivered a second time with a redelivery count of 4 instead of 2.  I attempted to work around this problem by enabling the redelivery policy plugin, but the plugin does not appear to be invoked in this case.  \n\nThe problem is easiest to reproduce when at least three consumers are processing messages from a queue when tomcat is killed.  While killing the application server in production is not ideal, it may be necessary if the application server hangs or runs out of memory.  Other conditions such as a jvm crash or a networking failure would also produce a similar situation.  \n\nWhile I understand that ensuring that messages are never delivered to consumers that are stopping might be difficult, I would expect a consumer to be marked as stopping within much less that a third of a second after its tcp connection closes.  I would also expect that when the redelivery count of a message is incremented, the redelivery plugin would have a chance to delay the dispatch of the message based on the configured policy.  \n\nHere are the log messages related to a message that is dispatched multiple times:\n2014-08-19 15:49:54,024 | localhost adding consumer: ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:10:114166:1 for destination queue://queueName | org.apache.activemq.broker.region.AbstractRegion | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp://xx.xx.xx.xx:59625@61616\n\n2014-08-19 15:49:54,626 | ack MessageAck {commandId = 559437, responseRequired = false, ackType = 0, consumerId = ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:10:114166:1, firstMessageId = ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:8:114134:1:1, lastMessageId = ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:8:114134:1:1, destination = queue://queueName, transactionId = XID:[...], messageCount = 1, poisonCause = null} | org.apache.activemq.broker.region.PrefetchSubscription | ActiveMQ Transport: tcp://xx.xx.xx.xx:59625@61616\n2014-08-19 15:49:54,624 | ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:10:114166:1 dispatched: ID:hostname-58095-1408405246656-1:8:114134:1:1 -
