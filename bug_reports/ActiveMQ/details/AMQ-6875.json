Finding the correct topic requires a little bit of overhead but this is only done if useVirtualDestSubs is set to true and a new virtual topic demand advisory is sent (ie when the consumer comes online) so it shouldn't be run very often unless there are consumers constantly coming online/offline which would cause a lot more cpu in other places as well.  Also, the arrays that are being manipulated/copied are going to generally be very small as they are just the size of a tokenized destination name.  If for some reason this ends up being a performance hit then the resulting computed topics could be stored into a cache so they only have to get computed once per destination.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
