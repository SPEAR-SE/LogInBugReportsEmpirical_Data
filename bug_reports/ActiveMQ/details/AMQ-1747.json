I am writing a custom authorization and authentication plugin for the lab where I am working. Because I still do not fully understand what happens behind the scenes in ActiveMQ, I usually browse the ActiveMQ source code and the latest snapshots so that I can keep our security plugin up to date with the latest patches that the AuthorizationBroker gets here. So looking here, I saw this patch for this issue. I was just wondering if instead of:\n\nreturn existing;\n\ninside the if statement (looking at the diff with the previous version of the AuthorizationBroker.java), one should write:\n\nreturn super.addDestination(context, destination);\n\njust like it is at the end of the addDestination method in AuthorizationBroker. It makes sense to me to do that since we're not just trying to add a user to an already existing destination, but we should also \"announce\" this addition throughout the whole BrokerFilter stack, shouldn't we? This way, for example, Advisory topics also get updated with the fact that this user tried adding this destination for herself. I assume that other BrokerFilters rely on this behavior (that addDestination() gets called for every user requesting a destination successfully).\n\nOr do I have this totally wrong and the addDestination method should only be used for adding destinations inside the broker, not to a user's connection? If that's the case, why is it that the issue described here appeared in the first place? Isn't the broker trying to create a destination (i.e. addDestination gets called) automatically for every new user requesting it?\n\nThanks,\n-Dan\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=danbucatanschi","name":"danbucatanschi","key":"danbucatanschi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dan Bucatanschi","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-12-12T02:55:28.017+0000","updated":"2008-12-12T02:55:28.017+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481882/comment/12940634","id":"12940634","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dejanb","name":"dejanb","key":"dejanb","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dejan Bosanac","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Hi Dan,\n\nstrictly speaking your suggestion is right, so I committed the change in SVN revision 731529.
