This breaks down when a non default port is specified for the broker.\nThe result is the camel context continually retrying to connect to a non existent port.\n\nIt may make sense to pull the camel context out of the default activemq.xml altogether but with it present, it may make sense to have the camel activmqcomponent use a default broker url that uses the vm transport as the context will always be embedded in a broker.\n\nOne issue with the use of vm transport is that the first use of the transport creates an embedded broker. With the xbean xml, the camel context bean starts before the brokerService so the result is two brokers.\nIt would be usefull if the vm transport url allowed an option to wait for a broker to start so that the camel context can reliably use the vm transport without the possibility of creating a separate embedded broker.\n\nSomething like the following would work:\n{code} vm://localhost?waitForStart=10000&create=false {code}\nIn this way, the camel embedded connection factory would wait up to 10 seconds for the localhost broker to start and fail with an exception (b/c create=false) in the event that the broker does not start within that time.\nThis would be a sensible default url for the activemq camel component in the acrtivemq.xml such that it is independent of transport options used by the broker.\n(The spring depends-on workaround for this ordering dependency only works in a complete spring context)\n\n{code}\n    <bean id=\"activemq\"
