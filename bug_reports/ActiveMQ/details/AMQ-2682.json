The variable APR_VER_REGEXES was set up so 1.3.* was expected, and 1.4.* was not.  The documentaion indicates that version 1.4.2 should be sufficiently advanced.\n\nSecond, the apr util version I had was 1.3.9.  When I changed APR_VER_REGEXES to expect 1.4.*, it started reporting that I had the wrong apr util version, even though I still had APU_VER_REGEXES set to expect 1.3.*\n\nIt turned out that there was an incorrect line, which worked okay if apr and apr util had the same version.  The original line was:\n    if test `expr $apr_version : $apu_wanted_regex` -ne 0; then\nthe corrected line is\n    if test `expr $apu_version : $apu_wanted_regex` -ne 0; then\n\nnotice that the apr version (apr_version) was being compared to the apr util expected regular expression (apu_wanted_regex).
