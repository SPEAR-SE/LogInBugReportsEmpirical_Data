This messes with the cache as it will continue to remove objects even if there is space in the cache.

As a consequence, for the next about 5,368,709 no messages will be removed from the cache any longer.\n\nThis sooner or later will trigger out-of-memory conditions, depending on the size of the various pools.

We see memory leaks connected to this bug and after good amount of headbanging I think the problem is in how two methods work together - processMessagePull and trackBack. The first one has this piece of code:\n{code}\n  // leave a single instance in the cache\n            final String id = pull.getDestination() + \"::\" + pull.getConsumerId();\n            messageCache.put(id.intern(), pull);\n{code}\nwhile the second one unconditionally increases the currentCacheSize - regardless if the previous method added or *replaced* entry in the cache.\n\nThe situation where entries will be replaced (and not added) and the currentCacheSize will grow very fast until it wraps around and becomes negative is the following:\n* have some logic that frequently creates queue browser and iterates through all the entries\n* have the queue most of the time with at least one message. The more messages in the queue the faster currentCacheSize grows.\n\nHere is log from reproducing the issue as a proof:\n{code}\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 10000, 5 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 8951KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 20000, 10 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10845KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 30000, 15 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12645KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 40000, 20 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10363KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 50000, 25 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12169KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 60000, 30 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9852KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 70000, 35 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11657KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 80000, 40 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9401KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 90000, 45 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11222KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 100000, 50 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 13047KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 110000, 55 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10767KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 120000, 60 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12567KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 130000, 65 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10256KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 138800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12085KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 146800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9745KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 154800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11566KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 162800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9225KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 170800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11013KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 178800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12812KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 186800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10522KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 194800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12328KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 202800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9999KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 210800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11805KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 218800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9496KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 226800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11316KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 234800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 13100KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 242800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10754KB\n{code}\nOne can see that the garbage collection works well (cache does not grow) but the currentCacheSize keeps increasing\n\nUnfortunately I cannot easily extract the original code and provide it.
