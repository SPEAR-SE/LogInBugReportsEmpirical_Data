(I'd like to provide queue-topic unification at some point so you can see durable topics as being like multiple virtual queues which multiple consumers can consume on the same queue to get load balancing - while avoiding the multiple-persistence of the message to each queue which happens now with composite destinations - but thats another topic).\n\nMy mention of RAM is that this error messsage...\n\n14:45:03 WARN Queue is full, waiting for it to be dequeued.\n\nis created when the queue dispatcher uses up its available RAM because it keeps all unconsumed queue messages in RAM until they are consumed. So its sounding like some messages on some queue are not getting consumed. Unfortunately in 3.x there's no easy way to look and see for sure - if you used 4.x you could just use JConsole to see all the queues and what messages are on each etc.\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-04-04T17:17:58.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-04T17:17:58.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481621/comment/12937844","id":"12937844","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"BTW in 4.x the queue dispatch mechanism has been completely changed so that we can deal with massive queues with millions of messages on them; we don't have to keep around the entire queue contents in RAM in 4.x so you should not see the \"WARN Queue is full, waiting for it to be dequeued. \" messages in 4.x","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-04-04T17:18:53.000+0000","updated":"2006-04-04T17:18:53.000+0000"}],"maxResults":8,"total":8,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-674/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0rznj:"}}
