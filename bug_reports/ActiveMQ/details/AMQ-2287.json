A letter is any character for which the method Character.isJavaLetter returns true. This includes '_' and '$'. A letter or digit is any character for which the method Character.isJavaLetterOrDigit returns true.\n    * Identifiers cannot be the names NULL, TRUE, and FALSE.\n    * Identifiers cannot be NOT, AND, OR, BETWEEN, LIKE, IN, IS, or ESCAPE.\n    * Identifiers are either header field references or property references. The type of a property value in a message selector corresponds to the type used to set the property. If a property that does not exist in a message is referenced, its value is NULL.\n    * The conversions that apply to the get methods for properties do not apply when a property is used in a message selector expression. For example, suppose you set a property as a string value, as in the following:\n\n      myMessage.setStringProperty(\"NumberOfOrders\", \"2\");\n\n      The following expression in a message selector would evaluate to false, because a string cannot be used in an arithmetic expression:\n\n      \"NumberOfOrders > 1\"\n\n    * Identifiers are case-sensitive.\n    * Message header field references are restricted to JMSDeliveryMode, JMSPriority, JMSMessageID, JMSTimestamp, JMSCorrelationID, and JMSType. JMSMessageID, JMSCorrelationID, and JMSType values may be null and if so are treated as a NULL value.\n    * Any name beginning with 'JMSX' is a JMS defined property name.\n    * Any name beginning with 'JMS_' is a provider-specific property name.\n    * Any name that does not begin with 'JMS' is an application-specific property name. \n{quote}\n\n\nChecks for this need to be added to all ActiveMQMessage.setXXXProperty() methods.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"255235","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ActiveMQMessage.setXXXProperty() method needs to check if property name is a valid Java identifier.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483559/comment/12941465","id":"12941465","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"Could use the following helper method:\n\n{code:java}\npublic boolean isJavaIdentifier() {\n      int n = length();\n      if (n==0) return false;\n      if (!Character.isJavaIdentifierStart(charAt(0)))\n          return false;\n      for (int i = 1;
