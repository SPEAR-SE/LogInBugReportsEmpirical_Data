The last \"5\" in the Cron Entry specifies only Fridays and 2011-03-04 is a Friday. The cron job ran and set \"next scheduled time\" to be 2011-03-10 20:50:25. 2011-03-11 is a Thursday. The correct \"next scheduled time\" should be 2011-03-11 20:50:25; it should be Friday.\n\nIn addition, the reason why I set the delay to 61000 was because with the default delay of 0, the job executes twice with a 60 second interval. I will file a separate issue.\n\nI believe the Cron Entry has a problem with using asterisks. I tried a Cron Entry of \"27 19 1-31 1-12 6\" which is a Saturday. It ran at 19:27 and then correctly set the \"next scheduled time\" to be on the next Saturday.
