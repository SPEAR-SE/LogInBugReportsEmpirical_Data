I had tested this with our integration tests which uses Jetty's client websocket client library and Firefox, and of course that's the one browser that works :)\n\nThe issue is that most likely you are using the stomp.js library and that library is setting the accepted sub protocol (the Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header) as \"v10.stomp\" and \"v11.stomp\".  However, the web socket server in ActiveMQ is setting the accepted protocol to just plain \"stomp\", so there is no match.  I will put a fix in for this so in 5.13.1 all 3 protocol strings will be there.\n\nFor now, as a work around, you should be able to specify the protocol if you are using stomp.js (or any other websocket client).  For stomp.js, if you look at http://jmesnil.net/stomp-websocket/doc/ there is information on how to change the subprotocol, which should be \"stomp\" for now.  For example, you would switch your connection line from: \n\n{{Stomp.client(url)}} to {{Stomp.client(url, \\['stomp'])}}\n\nand that should work.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
