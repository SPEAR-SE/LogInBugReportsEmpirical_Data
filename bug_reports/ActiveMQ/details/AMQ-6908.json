QueueBrowseQuery\n\n    `org.apache.activemq.web.controller.SendMessage` uses `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient`, which can be configured to use console login credential instead of system user credential (by setting the connection factory username and password to `null`). This allows seamless per-user based authorization for operations through the web console. \r\n    \r\n    `org.apache.activemq.web.QueueBrowseQuery` was not using the `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient` so it was impossible to setup authorization on per-user basis for browsing messages of a queue through web console. \r\n    \r\n    This change migrates `org.apache.activemq.web.QueueBrowseQuery` to use `org.apache.activemq.web.WebClient`.\r\n\n\nYou can merge this pull request into a Git repository by running:\n\n    $ git pull https://github.com/alvinlin123/activemq amq-6908\n\nAlternatively you can review and apply these changes as the patch at:\n\n    https://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/280.patch\n\nTo close this pull request, make a commit to your master/trunk branch\nwith (at least) the following in the commit message:\n\n    This closes #280\n    \n----\ncommit 822cf6203437f06a58e8e442de87b8416ad232e6\nAuthor: Alvin Lin <alvinlin@...>\nDate:   2018-03-16T18:30:05Z\n\n    AMQ-6908 allow use of ActiveMQ console login credential (for authorization) when browsing messages through the console\n\n----\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=githubbot","name":"githubbot","key":"githubbot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF GitHub Bot","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-03-16T19:08:05.085+0000","updated":"2018-03-16T19:08:05.085+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13141985/comment/16402364","id":"16402364","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alvinlin123","name":"alvinlin123","key":"alvinlin123","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alvin Lin","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I submitted a pull request to fix this issue\r\n\r\n \r\n\r\nhttps://github.com/apache/activemq/pull/280","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alvinlin123","name":"alvinlin123","key":"alvinlin123","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alvin Lin","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-03-16T19:10:26.586+0000","updated":"2018-03-16T19:10:26.586+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6908/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3qryf:"}}
