the message payload exceeds {{StompWireFormat.MAX_DATA_LENGTH}}. \nThis command is then processed in {{ProtocolConverter.onStompCommand()}}:\n\n{code}\n    public void onStompCommand(StompFrame command) throws IOException, JMSException {\n        try {\n\n            if (command.getClass() == StompFrameError.class) {\n                throw ((StompFrameError)command).getException();\n            }\n    ...\n        } catch (ProtocolException e) {\n            handleException(e, command);\n            // Some protocol errors can cause the connection to get closed.\n            if (e.isFatal()) {\n               getStompTransport().onException(e);\n            }\n        }\n    }\n{code}\n\nwhich re-throws the exception, catches it and calls {{handleException()}}.\n{{ProtocolConverter.handleException()}} creates and sends a stomp error response back to the client.\nThereafter it executes above line \n{{getStompTransport().onException(e);}}\nwhich asynchronously stops the transport. \n\nGiven that the transport connection is stopped async in a new thread, it happens that the error response is sent back to the client and the tcp transport thread continues to read the next command from the sockets input stream *before* the transport got closed by the extra thread.\n\nAlso given that we have so far read only read 100 MB out of 105 MB data from the input stream, there is another 5 MB to read. However the Stomp transport expects to read the next Stomp command (which is bound to 1024 bytes) and exhausts the 1024 bytes and next raises the error {{The maximum command length was exceeded.}}.\n\n\nOther than the two warnings, which can be misleading, there is not other side effect resulting from this bug problem.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-12-09T11:18:39.529+0000","updated":"2016-12-09T11:23:06.551+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13026950/comment/15735048","id":"15735048","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"I investigated into possible fixes but it seems there is no simple fix.\nIdeally we could close the tcp transport synchronously instead of async in this particular situation, however there is no such API offered in TransportConnection and I presume there is a good reason for stopping the transport async.\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-12-09T11:21:54.564+0000","updated":"2016-12-09T11:21:54.564+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13026950/comment/15735194","id":"15735194","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"body":"unit test in StompLargeMessageTest.java\nsimply install into activemq-stomp/src/test/java/...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tmielke","name":"tmielke","key":"tmielke","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Torsten Mielke","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2016-12-09T12:24:50.541+0000","updated":"2016-12-13T08:45:02.336+0000"}],"maxResults":3,"total":3,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6533/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i37e9b:"}}
