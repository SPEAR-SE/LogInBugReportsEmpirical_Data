The levelDB corrupts even at the point that every time I kill current master the next slave to take the position starts doing the infinite loop. The only way to fix this is to delete the leveldb data from all ActiveMQ instances which obviously lets me without messages. I find this issue to be quite critical as it occurs even on graceful shut downs of ActiveMQ.\n\nI have a attached a copy of the logs and my levelDB directory.
