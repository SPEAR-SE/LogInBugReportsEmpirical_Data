client"}],"timeoriginalestimate":null,"customfield_12310080":null,"description":"Hi. \nIn Mule ESB, \nI have detected a deadlock caused by the interaction between Spring and ActiveMQ.\nBasically, there are two execution chains that are causing the deadlock:\n\nFirst Chain: when a Message arrives to the JMS Queue:\n\n1) ActiveMQMessageConsumer.dispatch() gets the lock of FifoMessageDispatchChannel.mutex.\n2) ActiveMQMessageConsumer.dispatch() calls the onMessage() method without releasing the lock.\n3) onMessage Mule Implementation calls org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory$SharedConnectionInvocationHandler.invoke() because It needs a toString of the used resource (in this case the connection) to logging purposes.\n3) in ToString() method, org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.getConnection() method is called and It takes the org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.connectionMonitor lock to access to connection (that's a shared resource).\n\nLock ordering in this chain:\n\nFifoMessageDispatchChannel.mutex lock -> org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.connectionMonitor lock\n\nSecond Chain: when A reconnection-strategy is applied:\n\n1) Mule stops the current connection calling org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.localStop()\n2) LocalStop takes the org.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.connectionMonitor lock.\n3) After a chain of calls: FifoMessageDispatchChannel.stop() is called.\n4) FifoMessageDispatchChannel.stop() takes the FifoMessageDispatchChannel.mutex lock.\n\nLock Ordering in this case: \n\norg.springframework.SingleConnectionFactory.connectionMonitor lock -> FifoMessageDispatchChannel.mutex lock \n\nAs you can see, The chains don't take care about lock ordering, and It's causing a deadlock.\n\nI've sent a mail with same subject to the user list.\nAlthough I agree the best and faster solution is to not use the string() method of the connection in log (because It's taking a lock), and I'll remove it in Mule code, I think would be desirable to not call onEvent method without realising the adquired lock, to avoid potential deadlocks. \n\nThanks.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Deadlock
