This can cause some confusion.\n\nI found this issue pops up when recovering a master from a slave's data directory.\n1. Create a producer & consumer on the master/slave (where master is set to wait for slave)\n2. Send a few messages to the master/slave\n3. Kill the master/slave, and recover from the slave's data directory, and restart them\n4. Receive messages on the consumer (whose failover connection was waiting for the master/slave during the recovery)\n\nAny messages that were pre-fetched on the consumer will cause the master to report that the Slave Failed with \"Could not correlate acknowledgment with dispatched message\".  Perhaps this points to an issue in PrefetchSubscription too - but aside from the initial noise, the recovery works as expected  with no message loss.\n\nIncidentally, I would think that while the exception repose from sendSyncToSlave shouldn't stop the MasterBroker, the catch all (on line 395) should stop processing the same way that a sendAsyncToSlave failure does.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"0.5h","remainingEstimate":"0.5h","originalEstimateSeconds":1800,"remainingEstimateSeconds":1800},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":1800,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"59905","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"MasterBroker logs the same 'Slave Failed' error for all exceptions, whether or not the Master/Slave connection has been terminated","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kman","name":"kman","key":"kman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kyle Anderson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=kman","name":"kman","key":"kman","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kyle Anderson","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":1800,"percent":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":1800,"percent":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483567/comment/13512101","id":"13512101","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Pure master/slave is removed in v5.8.0","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2012-12-06T20:50:04.460+0000","updated":"2012-12-06T20:50:04.460+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2459/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0amf3:"}}
