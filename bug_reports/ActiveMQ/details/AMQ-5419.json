In practice, however, the feature seems to be tied to the connection as well as the consumer.  If a consumer with the \"exclusive\" flag enabled is created using a connection without the \"exclusive\" flag enabled, the consumer will behave like a normal consumer.  The exclusive feature will only work if the connection associated with the consumer also has the \"exclusive\" flag enabled.
