This can take a long time, especially if consistency checks are required. This means Master/Slave with shared FS is not really providing HA.\n\nIt is perfectly understandable, that for consumers the failover takes that long. They can only continue receiving messages, when all journals have been read. Otherwise order of messages would be destroyed.\n\nFor producers this is not the case, as AMQ could just create a fresh journal file and start appending immediately. Am I wrong?\n\nAlso it seems, that each kahaDB in an mKahaDB ist checked in sequence, so that in worst case even less filled queues are not available before everything is checked completely.\n\nLong unavailability for producers is unacceptable in most scenarios. It means that all producing clients have to take a serious amount of effort to protect against these scenarios in order not to lose messages (buffering, etc.). Or is there a best practise workaround?","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"HA: Slow Failover with AMQ + mKahaDb in Master/Slave setup with shared filesystem","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jfknaufancud","name":"jfknaufancud","key":"jfknaufancud","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Johannes F.
