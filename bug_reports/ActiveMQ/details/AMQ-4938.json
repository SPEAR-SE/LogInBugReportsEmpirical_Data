but the availableMessageListener for the consumer is never updated with that fact.  So, when the next message comes in, the listener consumes it with the intent that the continuation of the web request will receive it.\n\nI'm going to review this code more carefully for race conditions.  I'm convinced there are races on the use of MessageConsumer's if more than one web request comes in for the same consumer (e.g. using the same clientId).

Unfortunately, they are vastly different in their methodology - REST is based on synchronous request/reply and JMS is based on asynchronous passing of messages to consumers.\n\nConsider load balancing in a scenario mixing REST and JMS clients.  The current model, using prefetch to push messages, provides semantics that are more \"fair\" to the REST client by allowing messages to cache in the internal consumer for that client, just as they do for JMS clients.\n\nWith that said, there is no analogous REST scenario for automatically releasing messages when the connection closes because REST always closes the connection after a single message while JMS holds it open indefinitely.\n\nFor more advanced use-cases, perhaps camel would be a good tool to intelligently bridge the REST/JMS gap.\n\nBTW, the messages stored in the consumer for REST clients aren't truly lost.  They will sit indefinitely, but once the broker restarts, they will be returned to the broker.  This is actually bad for many reasons since it really means an idle consumer - very bad for JMS in general and activemq in particular.\n\nPerhaps we need a REST call that will force close a consumer, or a REST call that intentionally performs a one-shot message receive (i.e. automatically closes the consumer after the call).  Honestly, I'd prefer to put my effort elsewhere since, as mentioned above, REST for JMS is not a great fit.\n\nHope this helps.
