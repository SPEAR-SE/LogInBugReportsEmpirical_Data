In other words, in the context of an onMessage method, one can not create some objects (e.g. MessageProducer, MessageConsumer), which need to be acknowledged (a Packet with ReceiptRequired). I do not understand why when creating a Session one does not need such an acknowledgement, though there is to be sure a very good reason. I had a look to the JMS specifications, and there are no restrictions on the above scenario.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"171908","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"creating a producer inside an onMessage() causes deadlocks","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481329/comment/12937154","id":"12937154","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stewie","name":"stewie","key":"stewie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stewie","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"The problem is that there is not a separate thread for dispatching for each session - but all message dispatching is driven from a thread associated with the TransportChannel","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stewie","name":"stewie","key":"stewie","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stewie","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2004-09-03T08:36:48.000+0000","updated":"2004-09-03T08:36:48.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481329/comment/12936886","id":"12936886","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Incidentally I think there's a problem creating a Session inside the onMessage() thread as well...","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2004-09-03T20:28:52.000+0000","updated":"2004-09-03T20:28:52.000+0000"}],"maxResults":2,"total":2,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-38/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0tsdz:"}}
