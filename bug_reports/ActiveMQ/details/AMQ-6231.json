It checks the the number of messages in the prefetch buffer, and if that number is the same on the next check, that consumer is considered slow and is evicted.\n\nThis can be inaccurate though, because there is no check that actually looks at whether the messages in the prefetch buffer are the same messages as before.  In other words, if the consumer processes all the messages in prefetch, and prefetch is refilled to the same number as the previous check, the consumer will be considered slow.\n\nYou can reproduce this issue by starting with a queue with 5000 messages in it, and a prefetch of 1000.  Attach a consumer, and enable the Logger Plugin with logAll=true.  Set the AbortSlowConsumer strategy with default options.  After 30 seconds, even though the consumer has been reasonably processing messages, the Strategy will abort the consumer anyway, and you'll see a report from the Logger plugin that the consumer was slow.\n\nThen, repeat the same test, but set the AbortSlowConsumer checkPeriod down to a very small value, like 5 milliseconds.  The Consumer will never be considered slow.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"AbortSlowConsumer Strategy Inaccurate at default Sampling Rate","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jreock","name":"jreock","key":"jreock","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Reock","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jreock","name":"jreock","key":"jreock","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Justin Reock","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Any","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12956599/comment/15229062","id":"15229062","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"For this case it would be better to use the AbortSlowAckConsumerStrategy instead.
