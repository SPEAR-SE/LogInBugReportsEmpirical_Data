Tracking this failure down, the problem of the hung test was missing messages, part of the prefetch that were delivered while the consumer was closing. A timing issue between the audit rollback of  unconsumed messages and the delivery of messages meant that some messages were not rolledback on close.\nThe use case has consumers that connect, consume a batch of 10 messages in individual transactions and close. These operations complete before the prefetch(1000) messages haven been delivered so there was concurrent delivery and closure happing which sometimes resulted in the problem.\n\nThe fix is to ensure the consumer is removed from the session and closed prior to doing the audit rollback on unconsumed messages.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"159911","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Timing issue on consumer close can lead to unconsumed messages being inadvertently marked as duplicates and not getting delivered  ","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483216/comment/12942022","id":"12942022","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"resolved in r900317","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-01-18T09:48:10.751+0000","updated":"2010-01-18T09:48:10.751+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2572/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0rqc7:"}}
