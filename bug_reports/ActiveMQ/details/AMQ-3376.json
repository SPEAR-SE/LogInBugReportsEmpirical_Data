Topology looks like this:\n\n!http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/file/n3617053/amq_setup.001.jpg!\n\nAll nodes run on the same host, but within separate folders on the filesystem, so no nodes are sharing anything.\n\nI set up consumers on Node 1 and Node 3. \nI start producing messages to Node 1. \n\nMessages are distributed (load balanced) across Node 1 and Node 3 as expected, so consumers on both nodes receive messages. \n\nMessages produced to Node 1 are written to the slave node, Node 2, as expected. But messages that are forwarded to Node 3 for consumption there, are not deleted from Node 2.\n\nIf I produce 1000 messages to Node 1, and 400 of those are forwarded to Node 3, there are 400 messages left on Node 2 when all messages are consumed from Node 1 and Node 3 (queueSize = 0 on both). So the messages that are consumed on Node 1 are deleted from Node 2, but not those forwarded to Node 3.\n\nA possible fix: messages that are received on a master node, but forwarded to another node in the cluster, are *not* stored on the slave node.\n\nThe [ActiveMQ User mail list discussion|http://activemq.2283324.n4.nabble.com/Master-slave-cluster-leaves-messages-on-slave-td3617053.html] has links to the configurations for node 1-4.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"81478","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Master/slave + cluster leaves messages on slave","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eivindsi","name":"eivindsi","key":"eivindsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eivind Sivertsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=eivindsi","name":"eivindsi","key":"eivindsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Eivind Sivertsen","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"OS: Gentoo Linux.\nAMQ: apache-activemq-5.5.0-bin.tar.gz downloaded from http://activemq.apache.org/","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12511344/comment/13510738","id":"13510738","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Pure master slave functionality is removed in v5.8.0","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2012-12-05T20:34:52.653+0000","updated":"2012-12-05T20:34:52.653+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-3376/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0ealb:"}}
