After investigating this further we saw that certain messages references were being incremented more than they were decremented.  As a result the method org.apache.activemq.usage.MemoryUsage.decreaseUsage() was not being called when needed inside the org.apache.activemq.command.Message.decrementReferenceCount() due to the referenceCount being invalid.  AFter a while, 2days or so, with our configuration producerFlowControl would stop the flow of messages (invalidly) due to this problem.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461165","id":"12461165","filename":"r672943.diff","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tpounds","name":"tpounds","key":"tpounds","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Trevor
