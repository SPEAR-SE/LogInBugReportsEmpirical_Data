Where do I post it? \n\nThe TCP consumer thread updates the flowControlSleepTime long between the values of -1 and 10 (consume method). \n\nMy thread is attempting to issue an asyncsend. Within the asyncPacketSend method the value is referenced as follows: \n\nif (packet.isJMSMessage() && flowControlSleepTime > 0) { \ntry { \nThread.sleep(flowControlSleepTime); \n} catch (InterruptedException e) { } \n} \n\nthis.transportChannel.asyncSend(packet); \n\nTypical threading issue, the value is 10 on the if and -1 on the Thread.sleep..... and my thread sleeps forever..... \n\nThis jdk 1.5, one broker, one queue, two consumers and two producers. Each producer has one connection running all-out sends (no wait). I'm only getting about 7000 events/sec/avg through this configuration. \n\nThis code is attempting to slow down the client based on the CapacityInfo object being sent back to the client with a 'flow control time' to wait. I'll have to try using more connections (clients) to see if I can pass the 7000 mark. \n\nScott ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"171981","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"flowControlSleepTime in ActiveMQConnection is not properly synchronized.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481481/comment/12937260","id":"12937260","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"Added code to synchronize on a mutex before accessing that variable.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2006-01-13T03:04:27.000+0000","updated":"2006-01-13T03:04:27.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481481/comment/12937458","id":"12937458","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sirwin007","name":"sirwin007","key":"sirwin007","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Scott Irwin","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I never tried it before, but when I passed -1 to sleep you get an exception as apposed to sleeping forever.
