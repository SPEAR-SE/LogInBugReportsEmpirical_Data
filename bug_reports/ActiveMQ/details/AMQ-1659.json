So, my thinking was URIs\ncontaining: needClientAuth=true&wantClientAuth=true are technically\nincorrect.\n\nThat being said, I prefer the approach that you took.  Because from\nthe end users perspective it is very difficult to know that\nneedClientAuth and wantClientAuth override each other deep down inside\nof the JDK.  So as you say if the user configuring ActiveMQ and sets\nneedClientAuth then that should take precedence over wantClientAuth.\nThis is because needClientAuth is more restrictive of the two.\n\nI'm sorry I didn't run the tests, that was a lapse of judgment on my part.\n\nWould it be possible to update this page:\nhttp://activemq.apache.org/contributing.html\nTo include something like this in the \"Submitting patches\" section:\n\nQuick Check List:\n1. Does the patch apply clean to the version it is supposed to fix.\n2. Does the resutling patched code complie\n3. Do the Unit tests run cleanly\n\nAll of these are obvious, but it never hurts, to remind everyone.\n\nThank you very much for fixing this in time for ActiveMQ 4.1.2.
