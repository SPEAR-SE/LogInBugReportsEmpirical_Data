That would prevent the two Threads from attempting to delete the same row. This isn't the best solution but works in a situation where the sequence number is never provided with an acknowledgement.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161881","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"JDBC Message Store fails to remove duplicate messages","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matthewv","name":"matthewv","key":"matthewv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=matthewv","name":"matthewv","key":"matthewv","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Matthew Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP, Java 1.4.1_01 (Sun)","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481452/comment/12936386","id":"12936386","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chirino","name":"chirino","key":"chirino","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=chirino&avatarId=12659"},"displayName":"Hiram Chirino","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"What do you think about this issue?
