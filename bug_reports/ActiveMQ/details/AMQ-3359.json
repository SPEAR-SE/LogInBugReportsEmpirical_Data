As it appears, the different constructors in the UdpTransport class are intended for different uses. The constructor on which you made you changes is intended by the client transport creation. Which means, as you pointed out, there must be a bug because the server code is calling that constructor intended for the client. I have written a simple test to demonstrate the error, and the patch I added to the JIRA fixes the issue. Strangely, this issue's fix is related to the issue seen here: AMQ-3275. For that JIRA, a patch was committed to the trunk (http://svn.apache.org/viewvc?view=revision&revision=1089864), but it appears that patch was never merged in to any release versions. Tim, maybe you can see why that is. In any event, I've submitted my code anyway as a patch which adds comments and cleans up the code a little bit. See UdpTransportBindTest.java for a simple integration test that shows the connection broken and working before/after applying the patch.
