But it will notice once it tries to send it a message, so the it shutdown the dead socket and redelivers all messages queued for the client. On some OSes the TCP timeout interval can be tweaked. Otherwise, keep alive packets would need to be periodically transmitted in Stomp so that the server could detect a dead client sooner.

My producers connect by stomp to my broker. I believe a firewall in between the producers and the broker drops the connection when it's quiet for longer than a timeout. When the producers try to send another message, they see the dead socket and reopen a new one. However, my broker still sees the original connections as ESTABLISHED. This game plays out on any stomp connection that is quiet for longer than the firewall's timeout, which gives me about 25-35 leaked sockets a day until I hit the ulimit for file descriptors. At this time, my broker is hung: it cannot accept new connections, but has not crashed.\n\nI have several suggestions:\n1) bump the priority of this ticket\n2) implement keep alives and the maxInactivityDuration parameter for stomp\n3) when sockets are maxed out, kill old sockets LRU style so as to always accept new connections","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=bwtaylor","name":"bwtaylor","key":"bwtaylor","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Bryan Taylor","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-06-14T22:12:57.964+0000","updated":"2008-06-14T22:16:07.912+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483143/comment/13084726","id":"13084726","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Problems like this can be resolved by using Stomp v1.1 clients with heartbeats.
