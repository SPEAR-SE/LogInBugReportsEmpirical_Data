Whet JoiurnalMessageStore is performing checkpoint, consumers doesn't receive messages during that checkpoint. \nThe bug is that during checkpoint, messages are removed from cpAddedMessageIds list, and as I understand, this is temporal message store used during checkpoint. And during checkpoint messages shouldn't be removed from there, because consumer is using this member to get messages, which are already removed from short term storage, but not yet added to long term storage.
