Without using the user supplied key, subsequent deletes would not properly delete the message. Also fixed corresponding test cases to provide a message key when adding messages. \n\nAlso made some fixes to synchronization and delayed event processing in BrokerDatabase. The resulting code is not as performant in swimlanes testing, and should be optimized in the future (the problem is too many threads synchronizing on the opQueue is causing a lot of contention). \n\nFinally added some miscellaneous fixes to OpenwireProtocolHandler and the test drivers to avoid/detect duplicate messageIds.
