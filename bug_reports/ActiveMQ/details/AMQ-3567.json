This method will then call the stopMonitorThreads method which subsequently calls the shutdownNow method of the ASYNC_TASKS executor. This call causes the executor to call the interrupt method for all active threads in the executor. The problem is that the calling thread is part of the ASYNC_TASKS executor and therefore it is generating the interrupt exception. \n\nHere is the stack trace of the call that is causing the interrupt. \n\n{code} \nDaemon Thread [InactivityMonitor Async Task: java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker@66da9ea4] (Suspended (entry into method interrupt in Thread))   \n    Thread.interrupt() line: 902   \n    ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.interruptNow() line: 855   \n    ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdownNow() line: 1167   \n    InactivityMonitor.stopMonitorThreads() line: 363   \n    InactivityMonitor.onException(IOException) line: 264   \n    InactivityMonitor$4.run() line: 185   \n    ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.runTask(Runnable) line: 886   \n    ThreadPoolExecutor$Worker.run() line: 908   \n    Thread.run() line: 680  \n{code} \n\n\nThe solution is to replace the shutdownNow method call with shutdown. Subsequent testing with this change does not cause the interrupt exception. \n\nI was able to create a testcase that reproduces this issue. The testcase uses the useInactivityMonitor=false attribute to reproduce this issue, thanks Gary for the hint. Unfortunately there aren't any steps that I can use to determine that the raised interrupted exception was raised or not. The test will pass either way. \n\nA patch will be added to this issue.\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12500897","id":"12500897","filename":"inactivitymonitor.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ccorsi","name":"ccorsi","key":"ccorsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Claudio Corsi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Montreal"},"created":"2011-10-26T16:33:17.846+0000","size":7989,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12500897/inactivitymonitor.patch"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"59291","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"The InactivityMonitor onException call interrupts itself when the readCheckTime was exceeded.","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ccorsi","name":"ccorsi","key":"ccorsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Claudio Corsi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Montreal"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ccorsi","name":"ccorsi","key":"ccorsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Claudio Corsi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Montreal"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12528814/comment/13136083","id":"13136083","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ccorsi","name":"ccorsi","key":"ccorsi","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Claudio Corsi","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Montreal"},"body":"Here is the patch for this issue.\n\nThe patch also includes a test that will reproduce the exception but the thing to note is that to be able to confirm that the patch worked.
