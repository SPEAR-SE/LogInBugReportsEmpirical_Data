The problem is the classic lock hierarchy issue, one thread has asked for lock A then B, another has asked for lock B then A.\n\nI've attached an annotated jstack output with just the deadlock information, annotated with the locks involved.  I have also added a patch which seems to resolve the issue, but I can't be sure if the change has other ramifications.\n\nThe problem in a nutshell is one thread calls Queue.addSubscription(), which locks dispatchLock, and then calls wakeup/iterate() which blocks on iteratingMutex.\n\nAnother thread meanwhile has called Queue.send(), which locks iteratingMutex via wakeup/iterate(), but then tries to call doPageIn() which requires dispatchLock.\n\nIt seems to me addSubscription() doesn't need to hold on to dispatchLock while calling wakeup/iterate(), so I moved the wakeup() outside the usage of dispatchLock.  This ensures the lock heirarchy between iteratingMutex and dispatchLock is always obtained in the same order.  removeSubscription() has the same issue.\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461234","id":"12461234","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--deadlock.txt","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=sits","name":"sits","key":"sits","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"David
