This happens on initial connection and, if configured, as brokers come in and out of the cluster.\n\nThe problem is that the entire URI is given, including query string information.  If the query string contains commas in it then the Failover client breaks it up into unusable client uris and will attempt to connect to them.  Also, in 5.4.2, this leads to the same failure that occurs in AMQ-3085.\n\nAlso, there doesn't seem to be a point in the client trying to use the same query string parameters that the server is using.\n\nAttached patch strips the query string before sending uris to the client.\n\nExample:\n\nBroker1:\n\n        <transportConnectors>\n            <transportConnector name=\"openwire+ssl\" uri=\"ssl://0.0.0.0:61616?needClientAuth=true&amp;enabledCipherSuites=SSL_RSA_WITH_RC4_128_SHA,SSL_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_DSS_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,SSL_DHE_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_DHE_DSS_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA,TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA\" />\n        </transportConnectors>\n\n\nWith a client connecting to:  failover:(ssl://broker1:61616), you will see (extra debugging added by me):\n\n[DEBUG] FailoverTransport - Failover add: u[0] is: ssl://broker1:61616\n[DEBUG] FailoverTransport - Reconnect was triggered but transport is not started yet.
