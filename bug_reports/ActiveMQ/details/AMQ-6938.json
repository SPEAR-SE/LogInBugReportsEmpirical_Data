fail to start due to \"java.io.IOException: Could not locate data file /data/kahadb/db-531.log\" even though ignoreMissingJournalFiles is set to true. Presumably the purpose of that option is to allow the broker to ignore missing journal files (otherwise we chose poorly when naming the option and then failed to document it adequately on the wiki), which means the option doesn't work properly in all situations.\r\n\r\nLooking at the code on master as of 3/25/2018, org.apache.activemq.store.kahadb.MessageDatabase.recover() calls journal.getNextLocation(null) on line 677, which will throw the exception in question when DataFile.getDataFile() is called. This call to journal.getNextLocation() occurs outside of the while loop, whereas the ignoreMissingJournalFiles value is only checked in the catch block within the while loop, so we do not consider the ignoreMissingJournalFiles value in the call to getNextLocation(), even though missing journal files can cause getNextLocation() to fail.\r\n\r\nNote that the file is missing because the user manually deleted it in an effort to work around AMQ-6931, but that should not be relevant to the behavior that's being seen.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"KahaDB's

We could deprecate but keep (for now) the original name, but have both map to the same variable in the config class (via two setters but only one member variable). As long as the documentation for the old name clearly stated that the two were functionally equivalent and users should not set both values (or at least not to the same value), I'd think that would be a reasonable solution that was backwards-compatible for users upgrading but moved us in a good direction for avoiding future confusion.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tbain98","name":"tbain98","key":"tbain98","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim Bain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"created":"2018-05-05T02:47:09.092+0000","updated":"2018-05-05T02:47:09.092+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/13147837/comment/16464578","id":"16464578","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tbain98","name":"tbain98","key":"tbain98","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Tim Bain","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Denver"},"body":"[~gtully] So I guess the other question is whether the capability implied in the current name (i.e. the ability for KahaDB to ignore missing files, updating the existing index accordingly without requiring a full rebuild) should in fact be added to the current implementation.
