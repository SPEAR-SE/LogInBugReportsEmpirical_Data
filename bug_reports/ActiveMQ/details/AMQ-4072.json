For example, I get:\n\n     clientId: BA3CB329-3A27-4328-B3F7-E0E4F5655B69\n\n\nWhat is that \"clientId\" and do you happen do know why I get that instead of the correlation ID?\n\nHere is an excerpt from the boker log:\n\n2012-09-25 00:23:00,777 | TRACE | Run task done: org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQSessionExecutor@15004dd | org.apache.activemq.thread.PooledTaskRunner | ActiveMQ Session Task-2\n2012-09-25 00:23:00,777 | TRACE | ID:d22275-4226-1348543308113-3:11:1:1 received message: MessageDispatch {commandId = 6, responseRequired = false, consumerId = ID:d22275-4226-1348543308113-3:11:1:1, destination = queue://testq, message = ActiveMQTextMessage {commandId = 5, responseRequired = true, messageId = ID:d22275-4226-1348543308113-3:10:1:1:1, originalDestination = null, originalTransactionId = null, producerId = ID:d22275-4226-1348543308113-3:10:1:1, destination = queue://testq, transactionId = null, expiration = 0, timestamp = 1348546980730, arrival = 0, brokerInTime = 1348546980730, brokerOutTime = 1348546980777, correlationId = XXXXABCDEFGhijklm, replyTo = null, persistent = true, type = null, priority = 5, groupID = null, groupSequence = 0, targetConsumerId = null, compressed = false, userID = null, content = org.apache.activemq.util.ByteSequence@50a492, marshalledProperties = org.apache.activemq.util.ByteSequence@6481eb, dataStructure = null, redeliveryCounter = 0, size = 1134, properties = {clientId=BA3CB329-3A27-4328-B3F7-E0E4F5655B69}, readOnlyProperties = true, readOnlyBody = true, droppable = false, text = 1 This is a test msg sent at 25SEP2012:00:23:00.71.

I am currently under the gun with respect to some deadlines, so can't be anytime soon.  \n\n   With respect to the needs of my client app, I should mention it is a C-based client.  In the past, I already developed C-based interfaces that hop over through JNI to a JVM where I load a JMS provider.  However, now I am developing C-based interfaces that avoid a client-side JVM.  If I understand things, my two top choices are to access the ActiveMQ broker RESTfully over HTTP, or develop a C-wrapper to the ActiveMQ-CPP client library.  The latter seems involved and includes dependencies on open source client libraries such as ActiveMQ-CPP and the APR.  Given that someone else in my organization has already developed some C-based HTTP interfaces, I thought it would be best to choose the former, and make use of the HTTP protocol.\n\n   The C-based HTTP client code I call, establishes a connection using a URL.  Once connected, I can make many POST and GET requests, but I am encountering problems with respect to correlation ID's.  I cannot change the URL unless I re-connect, and I don't want to do that.  So, the only way I have found to POST messages within the same session/connection and with varying correlation ID's, is to use a content-type of \"application/x-www-form-urlencoded\".  That is a bit restrictive because then my users have to make sure the data is formatted correctly.  For example, you can't just send any text, without having to worry about special characters such as ampersand(\"&\").  Also, the only way I have found to obtain the correlation ID when GETting a message, is when the correlation ID was actually put in the message as a string property, and I must know the name of the property.  Making use of the JMSCorrelationID header field would be ideal, but the current MessageServlet doesn't support it with respect to the pattern I mention above.\n\nThanks,\nsv","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2012-09-26T16:49:21.858+0000","updated":"2012-09-26T16:49:21.858+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12608881/comment/13464099","id":"13464099","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"If you really need a C based wrapper for ActiveMQ-CPP there already is one on GitHub here: https://github.com/fusesource/fusemq-c","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2012-09-26T19:43:41.564+0000","updated":"2012-09-26T19:43:41.564+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12608881/comment/13464134","id":"13464134","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for the suggestion.

My management sets my priorities, and like most, I have more on my plate than I have time for.  I do appreciate the help I received, and I hope I can contribute some time in the future.  I sincerely do wish to.\n\nThe goal of this comment is provide more information regarding my use case.  The main purpose of this jira, is to report that a message's JMSCorrelationID header field, does not flow back along with the response headers.  The attached java test illustrates that issue.  I realize that beginning with 5.7, message \"properties\" will flow back as headers in the response.  However, the JMSCorrelationID does not because it is not property.  My use case hinges on the customers that expect my application to be able to obtain the correlation ID.  Given that I have chosen to implement my application using the HTTP interface, my application is currently unable to obtain the JMSCorrelationID.\n\nAside from getting the JMSCorrelationID in the response to a GET request, another use case involves POSTing a message that contains a correlation ID.  Using an url-encoded content-type, or specifying the JMSCorrelationID in a query parameter are two says to post a message with a JMSCorrelationID.  However, both of those mechanisms have limitations.\n\nIn one use case, see a customer using a client that is able to set the JMSCorrelationID when putting a message on the queue, and then expecting my client application to obtain it when  getting the message off of the queue.  I also see a use case where I want to post many messages containing different correlation IDs, all from a single connection to the broker.

Given that a JMS message's correlation ID is actually a header field, not a property, the correlation ID is currently not accessible to REST API clients that GET a message containing a correlation ID.  I consider correlation IDs as an important feature, and it seems odd that REST API clients do not see correlation IDs in the response to a GET request unless the producing application actually adds the correlation ID as a message property instead of simply setting the correlation ID header field.\n\nAnother outstanding issue I mention in this jira, pertains to a REST API client app wanting to change the selector within the scope of a session.  When the first GET request of a session causes the broker to create a consumer on behalf of the client, it does honor the selector header of that originating GET request.  However, subsequent GET requests within the session that have a different selector header do not cause the broker to re-create the consumer using the new selector.  That issue is important to me than the correlation ID issue.\n\nI did not attach a test program to illustrate the selector issue, but the Java client test program I attached to this jira can be used to illustrate the correllation ID issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-05-21T19:28:27.681+0000","updated":"2013-05-21T19:28:27.681+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12608881/comment/13663301","id":"13663301","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Regarding the selector issue, in that last comment, I meant to say it is not as important as the correlation ID issue.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2013-05-21T19:42:17.645+0000","updated":"2013-05-21T19:42:17.645+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12608881/comment/13839420","id":"13839420","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=steve.v","name":"steve.v","key":"steve.v","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Stephen Vincent","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I added a test on 25Sep2012.
