For the broker I'm using the default configuration that comes with the 5.3.1 download.\n\nThe ProducerFlowControlTest program does two things:\n# Read incoming messages from a queue\n# Once every 3 seconds: post a message on this incoming queue (from a different thread, so using a different session). Posting is done in a NON_PERSISTENT way.\n\nThe FastProducer sends some big text messages to the queue to trigger the 'producer flow control'. It uses PERSISTENT delivery.\n\nAfter a while this will get stuck and the FastProducer is not able to deliver all its messages.\nInstead of seeing something like this in the output:\n{noformat}\nReceived message of size: 47000\nReceived message of size: 47000\nReceived message of size: 11\nPublished message on queue\nReceived message of size: 47000\nReceived message of
