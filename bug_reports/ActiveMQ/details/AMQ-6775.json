there are messages queued on the consumers they are delivered to the listeners and if that is not the case, you should dispatch the messages queued in the session:\n\n\n{code:java}\n    public boolean iterate() {\n\n        // Deliver any messages queued on the consumer to their listeners.\n        for (ActiveMQMessageConsumer consumer : this.session.consumers) {\n            if (consumer.iterate()) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n\n        // No messages left queued on the listeners.. so now dispatch messages\n        // queued on the session\n        MessageDispatch message = messageQueue.dequeueNoWait();\n        if (message == null) {\n            return false;\n        } else {\n            dispatch(message);\n            return !messageQueue.isEmpty();\n        }\n    }\n{code}\n\nNow the following race condition arises: \n\n1) thread A (ActiveMQ Session Task) invokes .ActiveMQSessionExecutor\n\n2) When this part of the code is executed:\n\n\n{code:java}\n        for (ActiveMQMessageConsumer consumer : this.session.consumers) {\n            if (consumer.iterate()) {\n                return true;\n            }\n        }\n{code}\n\nActiveMQMessageConsumer.iterate is invoked. There are messages unconsumed in the consumer, but as unconsumedMessages is not started, a null is returned as if there were no messages queued.\n\n3) Thread A is interrupted\n\n4) Thread B (ActiveMQConnection[xx]Scheduler) invokes ActiveMQMessageConsumer.start, unconsumed messages are started.\n\n5) Thread A continues to deliver the messages queued in the session (*notice that if thread B starts unconsumed messages before thread A which happens most of times the messages in the consumer queue would have been dispatched*).\n\n6) Thread A dispatch a message from the session when there are messages from the consumer pending.\n\nThis race condition makes that in some cases a message which has been rollbacked and get queued back in the consumer is redelivered *after* another message in the session consumer (which was enqueued after the former message).\n\nMaybe the following commit in my fork would fix the issue, adding a further verification to make sure that there are no messages queued in the consumers before deliver the messages in the session:\n\nhttps://github.com/fsgonz/activemq/commit/0411242fddb16edba38ead18fa99dd9a79a183bc\n\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race
