This takes 7 seconds.\n* A consumer registers as a durable subscriber and receives those 10,000 messages. This takes 6 seconds.\n* Now 100 consumers register with the topic instead of just one. Each consumer receives each message. How long should this take?\n** Well, first I'd expect a factor of 100, because each message will be read 100 times from the topic.\n** Then we will have some administrative overhead, so lets be very pessimistic and add a factor of 2.\n** Or, no, lets use 3 instead of 2, because we might have been exceptionally lucky with the 6 seconds it took to receive the messages with one consumer.\n\nFollowing this calculation, I'd expect a runtime of at most '''6s * 100 * 3 = 1,800s''' (30 minutes).\n\nHowever, instead of half an hour the test program ran '''5 hours and 18 minutes'''!\n\nWith ActiveMQ revision 629726 the situation has improved considerably. Instead of 5 hours and 18 minutes the test took '''1 hour and 58 minutes'''. This a considerable gain by a factor of 2,7! However, it still seems slow compared with the worst-case expection of 30 minutes.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rainer+klute","name":"rainer klute","key":"rainer klute","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Rainer Klute","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-02-22T09:37:46.125+0000","updated":"2008-02-22T09:38:05.871+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482300/comment/12939340","id":"12939340","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=fullung","name":"fullung","key":"fullung","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Albert Strasheim","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"body":"Hello,\n\nCould you post the code you used?
