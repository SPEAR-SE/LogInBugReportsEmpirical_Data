It increases for non-durable subscribers but not for durable subscribers. Moreover, the dequeue count on a topic is not very meaningful. It can be changed so that topic dequeue counts are not updated at all. \n\nAlso, it would be nice if such information is properly documented somewhere in ActiveMQ docs as I couldn't find any information regarding  this behavior in ActiveMQ docs.
