The consumers of this broker are embedded C clients, which are connected to the broker using STOMP transport. When the consumer clients crash or do not close their connections the broker does not detect the event and do not close the connection with the consumers. My STOMP clients set the HEARTBEAT in the CONNECT with the values (1500,1500) and the broker response with a CONNECTED with the same values. Every second the consumer clients send a message to the broker to keep alive the connection using a topic with no subscribers.\r\n\r\nI have doneÂ  some tests installing the broker in Linux and Windows environments and I have noticed, that in Linux the broker closes the connection after 1:40 minutes, while in Windows after 0:20 seconds. It seems that the reason is due to the fact that the socket is still ESTABLISHED and populated by the broker until the maximum buffer size allowed. In fact if I disable the only one producer this problem does not happen anymore.\r\n\r\nI will attach you my activemq.xml configuration.\r\n\r\nThanks,\r\nAlessandro","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12923473","id":"12923473","filename":"activemq.xml.conf","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acel8","name":"acel8","key":"acel8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alessandro Celotti","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2018-05-15T12:37:13.741+0000","size":5988,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12923473/activemq.xml.conf"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ActiveMQ broker does not detect dead clients","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acel8","name":"acel8","key":"acel8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alessandro Celotti","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acel8","name":"acel8","key":"acel8","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Alessandro Celotti","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10431","value":"Important","id":"10431"}],"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-6961/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i3tq6v:"}}
