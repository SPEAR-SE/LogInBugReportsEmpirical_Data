However, this is probably not desirable in all cases as I'm guessing there are times when the update should be rejected (such as after an ack).

The issue occurs when persistJmsRedelivered is turned on for a Queue and concurrentStoreAndDispatchQueues is used.\n\nWhat I'm seeing is that when rapidly producing/consuming, after a consumer gets all of the messages, sometimes the message reappears.  The cause seems to be that sometimes the message has been acked by the consumer and removed after it has been added to the store but before the update command runs (to set the redelivered flag).  So what happens with this fix is that at the end it will try to update a non-existent message so it will end up re-adding it.\n\nIn a test on my machine with 1 producer/consumer rapidly producing and consuming 50k messages, at the end of the test I consistently see 10-20 messages left over in the store even though the consumer has already received them all.  \n\nI'm investigating more now to see if there is a good way to fix this without having to completely back out this patch.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=cshannon","name":"cshannon","key":"christopher.l.shannon","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=christopher.l.shannon&avatarId=24614"},"displayName":"Christopher L.
