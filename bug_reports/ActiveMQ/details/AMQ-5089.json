(for queue these are now held messages and for topic those messages are dropped). But when I check in Jconsole, I found that: for a queue it is working fine and going down to 0 but for topics inflight count is not changing.\n\n\n\nTest Case: I tested with normal java consumer subscribing to a topic, I put thread.sleep(5000) while receiving messages. Now consumer will take time to acknowledge messages which are received. So that we can see inflight messages. \nNow after 5 seconds, consumer has received the messages and also sent acknowledgement to the broker but inflight count is not decreasing. Now if I disconnects consumer inflight count should go down to '0', again here also it is not changing for that topic.\n\n\n\nThanks,\nAnuj ","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"378005","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Inflight Count for topics is not correct","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anujkhandelwal","name":"anujkhandelwal","key":"anujkhandelwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10442","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10442","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10442","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10442"},"displayName":"Anuj Khandelwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anujkhandelwal","name":"anujkhandelwal","key":"anujkhandelwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10442","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10442","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10442","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10442"},"displayName":"Anuj Khandelwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699366/comment/13930491","id":"13930491","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anujkhandelwal","name":"anujkhandelwal","key":"anujkhandelwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10442","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10442","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10442","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10442"},"displayName":"Anuj Khandelwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Did anybody get a chance to look at this ?","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=anujkhandelwal","name":"anujkhandelwal","key":"anujkhandelwal","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10442","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10442","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10442","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10442"},"displayName":"Anuj Khandelwal","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2014-03-11T15:56:46.374+0000","updated":"2014-03-11T15:56:46.374+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12699366/comment/13930537","id":"13930537","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=gtully","name":"gtully","key":"gtully","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Gary Tully","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I had a quick peek just now, it looks like we could improve this, we track the enqueue/dequeue count for a topic sub but don't subtract the difference from the destination inflight when the consumer goes away with pending acks.
