The manifest points to the o.a.a.broker.Main class.  \n\nUse of this execution option and review of the o.a.a.broker.Main class (where it sets up a classloader with classpath pointing to the conf, lib and lib/optional directories would lead one to believe that the o.a.a.broker.Main class would be loaded from run.jar.  This is not the case as the script also defines the java property of java.ext.dirs to append the activemq directories.  While it also sets the command line classpath option, this is useless as including all the activemq directories will already include all activemq classes at the base classloader. This also includes a copy of the o.a.a.broker.Main class that is include in the uber activemq-4.0.jar in the ACTIVEMQ_HOME directory.\n\nAlso with the definition java.ext.dirs this will total obviate any setting of classpath information on the classloader  (auto or parameter specified) by the o.a.a.broker.Main class.\n\nObviously something is not right here.  If  o.a.a.broker.Main class is suppose to be setting up the class loader, why is the script setting the java.ext.dir property and the classpath option on the command line?\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254628","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Conflicts between execution script and o.a.a.broker.Main class","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"w2k and linux java 1.5","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12481535/comment/12937297","id":"12937297","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=dennis%40bevocal.com","name":"dennis@bevocal.com","key":"dennis@bevocal.com","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dennis Cook","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I have made reconcilations between the start script for windows and the Main class such that the --extdir option works as expected.
