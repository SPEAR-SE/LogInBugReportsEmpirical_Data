The reconnect logic is going to rapidly try and connect over and over again unless you tune it to slow down and that is probably what is spiking your cpu so high.  \n\nFor tuning, you can try setting reconnectDelay or initialReconnectDelay to something longer.  The default initialReconnectelay is only 10 ms.  You can also try playing around with exponential back off and enable useExponentialBackOff which should lower your cpu usage.
