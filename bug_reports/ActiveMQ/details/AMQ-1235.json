ScheduledFuture ticket should be passed to clockDaemon.remove().\n\nthe javadocs of ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.remove discuss the possibility that Runnables might be stored in some other form internally, so calling remove with a plain Runnable might not do anything. I think the solution is to call remove with a ScheduledFuture, which is how they are stored internally in ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.\n\n\ni came across this bug after upgrading to the java 5 version of backport-util-concurrent 3.0. that version makes more assumptions about the types that are passed into ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.remove, so when you pass in a regular Runnable you'll get a ClassCastException.\n\n\nthis is trivial to fix, so i don't think a patch is necessary. also i think this might address the memory leak mentioned in

alternatives are\n\n1) don't call ScheduledThreadPoolExecutor.remove at all... which is equivalent to the current behavior, tho this wil leave the executor with lots of cancelled tasks (see AMQ-1205)\n\n2) cast ticket to RunnableScheduledFuture, and call remove on that. this will work because in this case ticket is a RunnableScheduledFuture, tho its probably worthwhile adding an
