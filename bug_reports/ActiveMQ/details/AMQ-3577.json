loop.  \n\nYou can see that the connection was never cleaned up properly and eventually the broker slows to a crawl because of the OOM.\n\nWith the patch, the broker keeps going without any issues.\n\nThe main difference is that the thread count is increasing without the fix and with it the thread count does not.\n\nA simple workaround is that the user calls does the following:\n\n{code}\n\n   // This will clear the interrupted state to allow the connection to cleanup properly\n   boolean interrupt = Thread.interrupted();\n\n   connection.close();\n\n   if (interrupted) \n     // This will reset the interrupt state for this thread.\n
