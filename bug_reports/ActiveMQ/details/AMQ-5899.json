Lets call these server A, B and C, and lets say A is master. if you stop 2 servers, A and B, while at the same time you are send messages to server A, everything will go down; which makes since. Now if you start up you start up A and B, you will get an Unknown data type and a javax.IOException or a null pointer excepting after a master has been selected and a slave has attached.\n\nI suspect this is caused mainly because during the time these servers stopped replication was occurring, thus \"corrupting\" the levelDB. I say \"corrupting\", however there has been cases were I only started one up after going below viable and everything worked fine, so this could be caused by a synchronization issue with levelDB replication.\n\nAfter I get this Unknown data type error which value changes every time I replicated this issue,  the master server will restart. This happens many times and eventually the ActiveMQ process dies.\n\nSo far to get these server up an running again I need to clear the activemq-data folder where all the replication logs are located.
