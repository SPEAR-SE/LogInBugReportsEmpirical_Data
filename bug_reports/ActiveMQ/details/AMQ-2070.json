If you have any question regarding these changes, please let me know. Thank you.\n\nWith the patches:\n\nHere is a sample usage:\n./activemq-admin stopGracefully --connectorName ssl --queueName test*? --timeout 120 --pollInterval 20 --jmxurl service:jmx:rmi:///jndi/rmi://localhost:3616/jmxrmi\n\nthis command will stop connector ssl, and it will check queues starting with test (queueName takes regex) to make sure they have no pending messages then stop the broker. It will check the queuesize every 20 seconds and timeout in 120 seconds. If after timeout, there are still pending messages in the queues, it will not stop the broker and it will need manual check to stop the broker properly.\n\nADDED: \n1. the patches fix more issues for stopping the broker. if broker starts as master and waitForslave, stop will not let the java quit the process. Also if slave is started first and use failover to talk to the master, you can also stop it before it establish the connection with the master.\n\n2. added to use localProcessId to get jmxurl, that way, activemq-admin can access jmx as a local jconsole, without jmxuser and jmxpassword, while remote jconsole still needs authentication when it is turned on. for this you need -Dcom.sun.management.jmxremote when starting activemq\n\nThere is a known issue of jmx rmi is two ports, one can be configured and the other is using random ports when a remote jconsole connects. this is not acceptable in a firewall environment. If concerned, please check my other post http://www.nabble.com/JMX-remote-managmentContext-and-firewall-to21969017.html you can use a custom agent to be able to configure two fixed ports.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461614","id":"12461614","filename":"AMQ-2070-5.3.1.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yinghe0101","name":"yinghe0101","key":"yinghe0101","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ying","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-04-08T17:50:31.365+0000","size":914,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461614/AMQ-2070-5.3.1.patch"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461254","id":"12461254","filename":"patchActiveMQConsole5.2.0","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yinghe0101","name":"yinghe0101","key":"yinghe0101","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ying","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-20T15:22:08.248+0000","size":8899,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461254/patchActiveMQConsole5.2.0"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461276","id":"12461276","filename":"patchActiveMQCore5.2.0","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yinghe0101","name":"yinghe0101","key":"yinghe0101","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ying","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-20T15:21:41.218+0000","size":18637,"mimeType":"application/octet-stream","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461276/patchActiveMQCore5.2.0"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461299","id":"12461299","filename":"StopGracefullyCommand.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=yinghe0101","name":"yinghe0101","key":"yinghe0101","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ying","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2009-02-20T15:22:19.346+0000","size":5966,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461299/StopGracefullyCommand.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch
