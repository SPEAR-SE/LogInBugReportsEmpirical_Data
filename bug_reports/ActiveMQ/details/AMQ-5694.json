Today I grabbed a JMX console and had a look, and the thread is not dead, it is just locked on the delete call. (see screenshot)\n\nWe have another problem with a shared JDBC \"cluster\" (the \"single master, hot standbys\" setup), where the nodes loose master and effectively goes down. What I believe happens, is that the thread sends the delete message, and then goes into a blocking wait for the reply, which never appears, probably because the broker that was master and should have sent it, is now dead.\n\nThe delete code path should probably have had some sane timeout, and just have raised some JMSException - or something.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12708274","id":"12708274","filename":"thread hangs.png","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stolsvik","name":"stolsvik","key":"stolsvik","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Endre Stølsvik","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Oslo"},"created":"2015-03-31T00:20:04.762+0000","size":127450,"mimeType":"image/png","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12708274/thread+hangs.png"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"ActiveMQTempDestination.delete() can block forever","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stolsvik","name":"stolsvik","key":"stolsvik","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Endre Stølsvik","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Oslo"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=stolsvik","name":"stolsvik","key":"stolsvik","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Endre Stølsvik","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Oslo"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5694/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i27kfb:"}}
