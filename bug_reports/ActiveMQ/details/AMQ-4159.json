This was unexpected because only a single service (URL) had been given to {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent}}.  In fact, during one of the tests I observed dozens of concurrent calls.\n\nConcurrent attempts to establish a bridge to the *same* remote broker are problematic because they expose a number of race conditions in {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} and {{RegionBroker}} that can lead to permanent bridge failure (see AMQ-4160), as well as unnecessary thread pool execution/resource usage and logging.\n\nThe issues with {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} and {{RegionBroker}} will be filed as separate issues.  This issue specifically addresses the bug that causes {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent}} to uncontrollably multiply bridge connection attempts.\n\nCause\n=====\nWhen {{DemandForwardingBridgeSupport}} handles exceptions from either the local or remote sides of the the bridge, it fires a \"bridge failed\" event:\n\n{code:title=DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.java}\npublic void serviceLocalException(Throwable error) {\n    if (!disposed.get()) {\n        LOG.info(\"Network connection between \" + localBroker + \" and \" + remoteBroker + \" shutdown due to a local error: \" + error);\n        LOG.debug(\"The local Exception was:\" + error, error);\n        brokerService.getTaskRunnerFactory().execute(new Runnable() {\n            public void run() {\n                ServiceSupport.dispose(getControllingService());\n            }\n        });\n        fireBridgeFailed();\n    }\n}\n\n\npublic void serviceRemoteException(Throwable error) {\n    if (!disposed.get()) {\n        if (error instanceof SecurityException || error instanceof GeneralSecurityException) {\n            LOG.error(\"Network connection between \" + localBroker + \" and \" + remoteBroker + \" shutdown due to a remote error: \" + error);\n        } else {\n            LOG.warn(\"Network connection between \" + localBroker + \" and \" + remoteBroker + \" shutdown due to a remote error: \" + error);\n        }\n        LOG.debug(\"The remote Exception was: \" + error, error);\n        brokerService.getTaskRunnerFactory().execute(new Runnable() {\n            public void run() {\n                ServiceSupport.dispose(getControllingService());\n            }\n        });\n        fireBridgeFailed();\n    }\n}\n\nprivate void fireBridgeFailed() {\n    NetworkBridgeListener l = this.networkBridgeListener;\n    if (l != null) {\n        l.bridgeFailed();\n    }\n}\n{code}\n\n{{DiscoveryNetworkConnector}} is the {{NetworkBridgeListener}}, and its {{bridgeFailed()}} method calls back to {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}}:\n\n{code:title=DiscoveryNetworkConnectol.java}\nprotected NetworkBridge createBridge(Transport localTransport, Transport remoteTransport, final DiscoveryEvent event) {\n    class DiscoverNetworkBridgeListener extends MBeanNetworkListener {\n\n        public DiscoverNetworkBridgeListener(BrokerService brokerService, ObjectName connectorName) {\n            super(brokerService, connectorName);\n        }\n\n        public void bridgeFailed() {\n            if (!serviceSupport.isStopped()) {\n                try {\n                    discoveryAgent.serviceFailed(event);\n                } catch (IOException e) {\n                }\n            }\n\n        }\n    }\n...\n{code}\n\nIn response, {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}} pauses for the {{reconnectDelay}} before attempting to re-establish the bridge via {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceAdd(...)}}:\n\n{code:title=SimpleDiscoveryAgent.java}\npublic void serviceFailed(DiscoveryEvent devent) throws IOException {\n\n    final SimpleDiscoveryEvent event = (SimpleDiscoveryEvent)devent;\n    if (sevent.failed.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n\n        listener.onServiceRemove(sevent);\n        taskRunner.execute(new Runnable() {\n            public void run() {\n                // We detect a failed connection attempt because the service\n                // fails right\n                // away.\n                if (event.connectTime + minConnectTime > System.currentTimeMillis()) {\n                    LOG.debug(\"Failure occurred soon after the discovery event was generated.

However, since the call to {{DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.stop()}} is made by a separate thread, multiple {{serviceLocal/RemoteException(...)}} calls that are made in quick succession can result in multiple calls to {{fireBridgeFailed()}}.\n\nThis is the first race condition: multiple calls can be made to {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector.bridgeFailed()}} for the same bridge.  By transitivity, this results in multiple calls to {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}}.\n\n{{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}} has a guard class, {{event.failed.compareAndSet(false, true)}}, which should only allow the first call to launch a bridge reconnect thread.  However, once the {{reconnectDelay}} expires, {{event.failed}} is reset to {{false}}, which allows re-entry to the failure handling logic, and the possibile launching of additional bridge reconnect threads if the {{reconnectDelay}} is short or the threads calling {{serviceFailed(...)}} are delayed.\n\nThis is the second race condition: the guard clause in {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed(...)}} can be reset before the subsequent redundant calls have been filtered out.\n\nThese two race conditions allow a single call to {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceAdd(...)}} to result in multiple subsequent concurrent (re)calls, and these concurrent calls can spawn their own multiple concurrent calls.  The result can be an unlimited number of concurrent calls to {{onServiceAdd(...)}}.\n\nUnit Test\n=========\nThe attached unit test demonstrates this bug by simulating a bridge failure that has yet to be detected by the remote broker (i.e., before the {{InactivityMonitor}} closes the connection).  The local broker attempts to re-establish the bridge, but its call to {{DemandForwardingBridge.startRemoteBroker()}} fails because the remote broker rejects the new connection since the old one still exists.  Since {{startRemoteBroker}} sends multiple messages to the remote broker, multiple exceptions are generated:\n\n{code:title=DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.java}\nprotected void startRemoteBridge() throws Exception {\n...\n                remoteBroker.oneway(brokerInfo);\n...\n            remoteBroker.oneway(remoteConnectionInfo);\n...\n            remoteBroker.oneway(producerInfo);\n...\n                remoteBroker.oneway(demandConsumerInfo);\n}\n{code}\n\nThe multiple exceptions result in multiple calls to {{DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.serviceRemoteException(...)}}, which allows the first race condition to be exhibited.  \n\nThe first unit test has a 1s {{reconnectDelay}}, which is sufficient to make the second race condition improbable; therefore, this test generally passes. \n\nThe second unit test has a 0s {{reconnectDelay}}; on my system, this makes the timing of multiple calls to {{DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.serviceRemoteException(...)}} such that the second race condition is reliably exhibited, resulting in the unit test failing because it detects concurrent calls to {{DiscoveryNetworkConnector.onServiceAdd(...)}}.\n\nSolution\n========\nWhile it would be possible to add a {{failed.compareAndSet(false,true)}} guard clause to {{DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.fireBridgeFailed()}}, and prevent the first race condition from allowing multiple calls to {{SimpleDiscoveryAgent.serviceFailed()}}, the root problem is the race condition in {{serviceFailed}}.  This can be trivially addressed by making a copy of the {{DiscoveryEvent}}, which prevents the original {{event.failed}} guard clause from being reset:\n\n{code:title=Patched SimpleDiscoveryAgent.java}\npublic void serviceFailed(DiscoveryEvent devent) throws IOException {\n\n    final SimpleDiscoveryEvent sevent = (SimpleDiscoveryEvent)devent;\n    if (sevent.failed.compareAndSet(false, true)) {\n\n        listener.onServiceRemove(sevent);\n        taskRunner.execute(new Runnable() {\n            public void run() {\n                SimpleDiscoveryEvent event = new SimpleDiscoveryEvent(sevent);\n\n...\n                event.connectTime = System.currentTimeMillis();\n                event.failed.set(false);\n                listener.onServiceAdd(event);\n            }\n        }, \"Simple Discovery Agent\");\n    }\n}\n{code}
