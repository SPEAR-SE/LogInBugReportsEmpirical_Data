Following warning is also generated by the client every 15s: \"WARNING: dispatch paused, waiting for outstanding dispatch interruption processing (20) to complete..\".\n\nDuring debugging I've found that code which is supposed to clean messages during reconnection await for MessageDispatchChannel mutex owned by one of the session threads (screenshot-1). This session thread, from the other hand, is in the middle of send operation and waits for server's response. In result messages dispatch awaits infinitely on CountDownLatch which is supposed to be decremented by the deadlocked messages cleaning code (screenshot-2).\n\nThis occurs in the latest 5.3.1-SNAPSHOT as well as in 5.3.0-fuse-01-00 version.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461652","id":"12461652","filename":"screenshot-1.JPG","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daroo","name":"daroo","key":"daroo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dariusz Szablinski","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-03-10T14:45:10.924+0000","size":237063,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461652/screenshot-1.JPG"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461653","id":"12461653","filename":"screenshot-2.JPG","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daroo","name":"daroo","key":"daroo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dariusz Szablinski","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2010-03-10T14:45:28.525+0000","size":320238,"mimeType":"image/jpeg","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461653/screenshot-2.JPG"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"159800","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Deadlock during FailoverTransport interruption","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daroo","name":"daroo","key":"daroo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dariusz Szablinski","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=daroo","name":"daroo","key":"daroo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Dariusz Szablinski","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":null,"customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483123/comment/12942333","id":"12942333","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Thanks for raising this - can you attach the screenshots ?
