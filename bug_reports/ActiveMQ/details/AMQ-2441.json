I set that ignoring setting values in the past is optional and off by default. It makes sense in some use cases, for example when all clients are on the same machine. But what if only some producers have wrong clocks and consumers are in the sync with the broker? The purpose of this plugin is to use broker time as relevant, but with this patch it will be also possible to prevent these changes. All you have to do is to set futureOnly property to true.
