We see memory leaks connected to this bug and after good amount of headbanging I think the problem is in how two methods work together - processMessagePull and trackBack. The first one has this piece of code:\n{code}\n  // leave a single instance in the cache\n            final String id = pull.getDestination() + \"::\" + pull.getConsumerId();\n            messageCache.put(id.intern(), pull);\n{code}\nwhile the second one unconditionally increases the currentCacheSize - regardless if the previous method added or replaced entry in the cache.\n\nThe situation where entries will be replaced (and not added) and the currentCacheSize will grow very fast until it wraps around and becomes negative is the following:\n* have some logic that frequently creates queue browser and iterates through all the entries\n* have the queue most of the time with at least one message. The more messages in the queue the faster currentCacheSize grows.\n\nThe reason is that processMessagePull reuses the consumer and destination ID for each browsed message in the queue when org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQQueueBrowser#hasMoreElements is invoked. trackBack is ignorant of this and keeps adding to the size regardless that the cache size stays the same.\n\nHere is log from reproducing the issue as a proof:\n{code}\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 10000, 5 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 8951KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 20000, 10 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10845KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 30000, 15 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12645KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 40000, 20 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10363KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 50000, 25 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12169KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 60000, 30 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9852KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 70000, 35 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11657KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 80000, 40 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9401KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 90000, 45 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11222KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 100000, 50 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 13047KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 110000, 55 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10767KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 120000, 60 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12567KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 130000, 65 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10256KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 138800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12085KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 146800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9745KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 154800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11566KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 162800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9225KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 170800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11013KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 178800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12812KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 186800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10522KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 194800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 12328KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:14  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 202800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9999KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 210800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11805KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 218800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 9496KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 226800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 11316KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 234800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 13100KB\n2014-01-16 23:05:15  WARN ActiveMqMemoryLeakTest - MaxCacheSize: 131072, currentCacheSize: 242800, 67 elements, pending scans:10, memory: 10754KB\n{code}\n\nOne can see that the garbage collection works well (cache does not grow) but the currentCacheSize keeps increasing\nUnfortunately I cannot easily extract the original code and provide it.
