If the queue is over the configured limit and then a consumer is attached, the flow control kicks in immediately and denies producers to push new messages onto the queue until the CursorPercentUsage is down to 100%.\n\nMore detailed:\nWhen there is only one producer and no consumer, the jconsole shows CursorMemoryUsage=0 and CursorPercentUsage=0 and the broker fills up the storage until it is full according to the systemUsage settings. CursorMemoryUsage can increase slightly but does not reflect the overall memory usage of the queue (mem+storage). The producer is only stopped (by the flow control?) when the queue hits the storeUsage-limit.\nAs soon as there is a consumer attached, the CursorMemoryUsage shows much higher values and the CursorPercentUsage is of course way over 100%. The producer is blocked until the CursorPercentUsage down to 100% and CursorPercentUsage is almost equal to the policyEntry/memoryLimit of the queue - which looks like the desired behavior to me. Now flow control works and keeps producer and consumer in balance.\n\nMy activemq.xml:\n        ...\n        <destinationPolicy>\n            <policyMap>\n              <policyEntries>\n                <policyEntry topic=\">\" producerFlowControl=\"false\" memoryLimit=\"5mb\">\n                  <pendingSubscriberPolicy>\n                    <vmCursor />\n                  </pendingSubscriberPolicy>\n                </policyEntry>\n                <policyEntry queue=\"result.>\" producerFlowControl=\"true\" memoryLimit=\"60 mb\">\n                </policyEntry>\n              </policyEntries>\n            </policyMap>\n        </destinationPolicy> \n        .....\n        <systemUsage>\n            <systemUsage>\n                <memoryUsage>\n                    <memoryUsage limit=\"100 mb\"/>\n                </memoryUsage>\n                <storeUsage>\n                    <storeUsage limit=\"1 gb\" name=\"foo\"/>\n                </storeUsage>\n                <tempUsage>\n                    <tempUsage limit=\"100 mb\"/>\n                </tempUsage>\n            </systemUsage>\n        </systemUsage>\n        ...\n\n\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"172273","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"FlowControl does not work when no consumer is attached","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alison","name":"alison","key":"alison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"André Lison","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=alison","name":"alison","key":"alison","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"André Lison","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Linux 2.6.25.20-0.5-default SMP x86_64 GNU/Linux\n\njava version \"1.6.0_17\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.6.0_17-b04)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 14.3-b01, mixed mode)\n","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12483756/comment/13064082","id":"13064082","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"Need a test case that can reproduce this, not seeing this behaviour with 5.6-SNAPSHOT.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2011-07-12T19:19:24.520+0000","updated":"2011-07-12T19:19:24.520+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-2685/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0tun3:"}}
