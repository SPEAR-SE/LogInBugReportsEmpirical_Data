During the run there're about 12000 msg flow in per second, not a very high rate, but ActiveMQ consumes a lot of CPU resource (about 600%~1000%). To find out what's the most CPU consuming code path, I use JProfiler to dig into the process. \n\nAmong all the NIO worker threads, most of them were frequently blocked and did a little job between the 'unblocked' time. While they're expected spend most of their time slices on waiting for work item and processed them.\n\n!nio_worker_blocked_frequently.png!\n\nAfter reviewing the monitor usage history and stats, I think these NIO workers were competing fiercely with each other on executing a synchronized method (DestinationMap::get), which is also the most hot spot in the program . I also notice that the caller AbstractRegion::getDestinations acquires a read lock before calling it, so I guess this could be a left out, read lock is the actual lock type required here.\n\n!monitor_usage_stats.png!\n\n!nio_worker_blocked_1.png!\n\n!nio_worker_blocked_2.png!\n\nIt's too difficult for me to list all critical sections between NIO workers, or between NIO workers and BrokerService which adds up to the overall synchronize overhead.
