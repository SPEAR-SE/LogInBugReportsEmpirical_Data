The symptom is that the BrokerService's memory usage increases with each message that is sent to a topic. The memory usage increases proportionally with the size of the message, as though each message is being stored permanently in memory.\n\nI've included an example which continuously sends messages around 1 megabyte in size to a topic with a single subscriber. If you run the included BrokerMemoryLeak.java, you should see the following output:\n\nMemory Usage:     0     Memory Percent:   0     Send count: 0     \nMemory Usage:     16016576    Memory Percent:   23    Send count: 16    \nMemory Usage:     38039368    Memory Percent:   56    Send count: 38    \nMemory Usage:     61063196    Memory Percent:   90    Send count: 61    \nMemory Usage:     68070448    Memory Percent:   101   Send count: 68    \nMemory Usage:     68070448    Memory Percent:   101   Send count: 68    \n\nBrokerService's memory usage climbs steadily until the memory percent hits 100. Then, messages stop being sent. There are several ways to make the bug stop happening:\n  * Switch from using a Topic to a Queue\n  * Switch the Broker address to 'vm://foo', so it's not using TCP\n  * Set the third argument in the 'createConsumer' call to false. (the noLocal argument)\n  * Don't register the MessageListener\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12461172","id":"12461172","filename":"ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--BrokerMemoryLeak.java","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=piepera","name":"piepera","key":"piepera","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"aaron pieper","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-08-05T18:34:40.702+0000","size":2286,"mimeType":"text/plain","content":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/attachment/12461172/ASF.LICENSE.NOT.GRANTED--BrokerMemoryLeak.java"}],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"159874","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Memory leak in broker when subscribing to a topic using TCP connector + nolocal","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=piepera","name":"piepera","key":"piepera","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"aaron pieper","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=piepera","name":"piepera","key":"piepera","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"aaron pieper","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Spring 2.5.4","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482738/comment/12940676","id":"12940676","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"body":"I've run the provided test case along with a unit test I created based off the sample with the latest 5.4 sample and cannot reproduce the reported behaviour.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=tabish121","name":"tabish121","key":"tabish121","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=tabish121&avatarId=25249"},"displayName":"Timothy Bish","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Havana"},"created":"2010-07-19T21:21:25.145+0000","updated":"2010-07-19T21:21:25.145+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1876/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0rq3z:"}}
