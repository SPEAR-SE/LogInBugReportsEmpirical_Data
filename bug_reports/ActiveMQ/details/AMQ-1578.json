By default, the idleTimeout is set to 30 seconds, and when this expires, it shuts down the connection's transport.  Furthermore, it ignores and knows nothing about the InactiviyMonitor's efforts to keep the tcp connection refreshed.\n\nA simple fix would be to have the PooledConnectionFactory have a setter for the idleTimeout property, and then pass this one when it creates new connections.   As a work-around, I've created a sub-class of the PooledConnectionFactory class, that looks like this (this sub-classes actually the jencks amqpool class, which is very similar to the activemq version of the class, which has the same issue):\n\n\npublic class PooledConnectionFactoryWithIdleTimeout extends PooledConnectionFactory {\n    \n   private int idleTimeout = 0; \n   \n   public int getIdleTimeout() {\n       return idleTimeout;\n   }\n\n   public void setIdleTimeout(int idleTimeout) {\n       this.idleTimeout = idleTimeout;\n   } \n   \n   @Override\n   protected ConnectionPool createConnectionPool(ActiveMQConnection connection) {\n       ConnectionPool connPool = new ConnectionPool(connection, getPoolFactory());\n       connPool.setIdleTimeout(idleTimeout);\n       \n       return connPool;\n   }   \n}\n\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"161775","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"No exposure to the 'idleTimeout' property for ConnectionPool class, which makes it difficult to implement keepAlive semantics on PooledConnections","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbrosenberg","name":"jbrosenberg","key":"jbrosenberg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Rosenberg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jbrosenberg","name":"jbrosenberg","key":"jbrosenberg","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Jason Rosenberg","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Los_Angeles"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"5.1-SNAPSHOT","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482419/comment/12939447","id":"12939447","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Fixed by SVN revision 646258","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rajdavies","name":"rajdavies","key":"rajdavies","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=rajdavies&avatarId=13942"},"displayName":"Rob Davies","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2008-04-09T10:22:02.771+0000","updated":"2008-04-09T10:22:02.771+0000"}],"maxResults":1,"total":1,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1578/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i0s1uf:"}}
