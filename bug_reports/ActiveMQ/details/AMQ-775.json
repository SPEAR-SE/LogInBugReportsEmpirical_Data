is in the wrong place, it should be moved to almost the very end of the method, otherwise if you use JMX, the ManageedTransportConnector won't have authorization policy info.\n2) ManagedTransportConnector doesn't pass the auth policy to ManagedTransport, I think the easiest way to fix it is in AbstractConnection constructor,\nadding this line:\n    this.messageAuthorizationPolicy = connector.getMessageAuthorizationPolicy();\nand remove this line:\n   answer.setMessageAuthorizationPolicy(messageAuthorizationPolicy); \nfrom TransportConnector::createConnection(), then it will work for both TransportConnection and ManagedTransportConnection\n3) AbstrctConnection doesn't pass the auth policy to ConnectionContext, I think this can be fixed by adding this line:\n  context.setMessageAuthorizationPolicy(this.getMessageAuthorizationPolicy());\nto AbstractConnection::processAddConnection() method.\n\nNow the auth policy can be reached by MessageAuthorizationPolicy::isAllowedToConsume(ConnectionContext context, Message message) method, but the real problem is message value is null, but we need to use it to check right, some of the right information is a property inside the message. \n\nPlease take a look at the problem, thanks\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"233314","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"MessageAuthorizationPolicy doesn't work","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ning.li","name":"ning.li","key":"ning.li","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ning Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ning.li","name":"ning.li","key":"ning.li","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ning Li","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"windows NT 2003 server","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482273/comment/12938615","id":"12938615","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkurtz","name":"jkurtz","key":"jkurtz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Kurtz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"cross reference to: AMQ-591...\n\nhttps://issues.apache.org/activemq/browse/AMQ-591","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jkurtz","name":"jkurtz","key":"jkurtz","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"John Kurtz","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"created":"2006-12-11T15:56:20.000+0000","updated":"2006-12-11T15:56:20.000+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12482273/comment/12936616","id":"12936616","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jstrachan","name":"jstrachan","key":"jstrachan","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"james strachan","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"I've added the test case MessageAuthenticationTest to show things working correctly.
