In contrast, createConsumer() throws an exception, as expected, when BrokerFilter's addConsumer() throws an exception.\n\nClients using transacted sessions always return successfully from send() when a BrokerFilter's send() method throws an exception.\n\nBelow is a broker configuration file using <authorizationPlugin> to illustrate the problem.\n\nTo reproduce the problem With this configuration, a test client only needs to connect with user = \"user\" and password = \"password\", and then attempt to produce messages with a transacted session to any queue other than ABC (e.g. DEF).\n\nTracing the cause of the issue has lead to finding that the client code for creating a producer uses an Async send for the producer information.  The analogous code for consumers uses a Sync send.\n\nI will work on a patch.  It would be very helpful to have feedback on the operation of the bus and the best way to resolve this problem.  Based on my research, it seems that createProducer() should be using a Sync send in place of the Async one.  Not yet sure about send().  Another possibility is to move the security operations to earlier in the internal broker flow.\n\n=== SAMPLE BROKER XML ===\n\n<beans\n  xmlns=\"http://www.springframework.org/schema/beans\"\n

Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"Research found the following:\n   - The exceptions are being sent over the transport from the broker to the client\n   - Client handling does not propogate the exception back through send() or commit() calls\n\nIt appears this is caused by the producer using async sends.  Looking at ActiveMQSession:\n\n            if (sendTimeout <= 0 && !msg.isResponseRequired() && !connection.isAlwaysSyncSend() &&\n                (!msg.isPersistent() || connection.isUseAsyncSend() || txid != null)) {\n                this.connection.asyncSendPacket(msg);\n\nmsg.isResponseRequire() defaults to false for most transport commands, including Message.  Taking advantage of the \"isAlwaysSyncSend()\" logic above, the following works-around the issue (when clients can be modified to use it):\n\n                org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnectionFactory   conn_fact;\n                ...\n                conn_fact.setAlwaysSyncSend(true);\n\nAttempts to use URI parameters, and searches through the code for URI parameters, have yielded no working solutions there.  If the connection URL could include a setting such as \"?connection.alwaysSyncSend=true\" would make this problem easier to solve since most clients use a configurable connection string.\n\nHowever, with all of that said, it seems that transacted sends - as well as creating producers - should be synchronous.  That can be solved by taking out the \"txid != null\" logic.\n\nFor further performance improvement over transacted sends, if a client wants batch sending, which is not part of the JMS standard, it makes sense to require clients to use ActiveMQ-specific features.  Perhaps a batchSend() method followed by batchComplete().\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"created":"2011-02-02T22:24:13.222+0000","updated":"2011-02-02T22:24:13.222+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497014/comment/12994586","id":"12994586","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=artnaseef","name":"artnaseef","key":"artnaseef","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10443","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10443","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10443","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10443"},"displayName":"Arthur Naseef","active":true,"timeZone":"America/Phoenix"},"body":"JUnit test program with 3 test cases:\n   1.

Setting an exception handler on the connection factory is not enough to be on the safe side, as we were able to construct a test case that builds a race condition between the producer thread and the exception handler thread such that the commit is done before the asynchronous exception callback is fired by the server response.\n\nE.g. set server memory limit to 1 MB only, send batch of 100 messages, server can handle only 95 messages, commit is done before callback is triggered: 5 messages are lost, 95 messages appear in the queue.\n\nAs lost messages within a transaction are really a bad thing we would appreciate Gary Tully's approach of setting a flag in the transaction context, so that any exception will always and reliably yield a JMS rollback. Besides that, an exception should be thrown in the commit thread such that there is no chance of having a silent failure from the client perspective. Otherwise the rollback may go unnoticed.\nTransaction handling should also be safe for those users that forget to set the exception handler at all.\n\nI do not favor the option of doing a commit for only a part of my message batch, i.e. when you have a failure after message 101 you should not be able to commit messages 1 to 100. For me transactions are always an all-or-nothing matter. As with asynchronous sends you have a delay of several send operations until the exception handler gets fired it would require significant client logic to determine which messages survived and which got lost.","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=ld4711","name":"ld4711","key":"ld4711","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Lars Ditzel","active":true,"timeZone":"Europe/Berlin"},"created":"2014-04-08T12:47:15.919+0000","updated":"2014-04-08T12:47:15.919+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497014/comment/13962931","id":"13962931","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mez","name":"mez","key":"mez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Messmer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"body":"I'm out of the office and will return on Monday, Apr. 13th.\n\n\n\n","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mez","name":"mez","key":"mez","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Kevin Messmer","active":true,"timeZone":"America/New_York"},"created":"2014-04-08T12:51:16.942+0000","updated":"2014-04-08T12:51:16.942+0000"},{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/12497014/comment/15299829","id":"15299829","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=jira-bot","name":"jira-bot","key":"jira-bot","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"ASF subversion and git services","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"body":"Commit fe9d99e7a071c4c09c78dfd95630036b86a8a05b in activemq's branch refs/heads/master from [~gtully]\n[ https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf?p=activemq.git;h=fe9d99e ]\n\nAMQ-3166 - implement rollbackOnlyOnAsyncException such that async exceptions on transactional sends or acks result in the transaction being marked rollback only and commit failing with an exception.
