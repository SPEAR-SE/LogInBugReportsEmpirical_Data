We have reports of up to 400GB of scheduler log files. I have tried to isolate the issue and create a minimal example (attached). In the troubleshooting I have done, the scheduler GC process is running, it's just deciding not to GC files that it should be. I have also found behavior inconsistent on the log files it does remove. \n\nThe ran the attached example/test on 5.10.0, 5.11.1, 5.12.0 and 5.13.0. The test schedules 20 messages that are large enough to cause 4 log files to be created. It then consumes all 20 messages. When on 5.10.0, it behaves like I would expect, files 1-3 are GC'd and the 4th (the current log file) is left. On all other versions I've tried it always leaves the first 2 files, and sometimes will GC the 3rd.\n\nBelow is a snippet from the log of the scheduler process and why it's deciding not to GC these files:\n{noformat}\n2016-02-01 16:32:33,327 DEBUG [main] [o.a.a.s.k.s.JobSchedulerStoreImpl] Job Scheduler Store Checkpoint started.\n2016-02-01 16:32:33,338 TRACE [main]
