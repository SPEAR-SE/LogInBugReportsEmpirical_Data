I have put breakpoints in this section of the code and confirmed this.\n\nThis later becomes a problem. If there are any messages that are acked that end up in {{redeliveredWaitingDispatch}}, this stops any message consumption from happening. \n\nIf you follow {{org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue#doDispatch:1957}}, you can see that {{redeliveredWaitingDispatch}} /always/ takes precedence. New messages that come in don't get dispatched until {{redeliveredWaitingDispatch}} is empty. The problem is that this /never/ gets emptied.\n\nIn {{org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue#doActualDispatch:2002}} at line {{2028}}, we only dispatch and remove the message if the {{QueueMessageReference}} is not acknowledged.\n\n{code}\nif (dispatchSelector.canSelect(s, node) && assignMessageGroup(s, (QueueMessageReference)node) && !((QueueMessageReference) node).isAcked() ) {\n                            // Dispatch it.\n                            s.add(node);\n                            LOG.trace(\"assigned {} to consumer {}\", node.getMessageId(), s.getConsumerInfo().getConsumerId());\n                            iterator.remove();\n                            target = s;\n                            break;\n                        }\n{code}\n\n\nI have a simple patch that will fix the issue, but I am not sure of the full implications of the patch. I am hoping one of the ActiveMQ developers could chime in here:\n\n{code}\ndiff --git a/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java b/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java\nindex c0a237f..64717f5 100755\n--- a/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java\n+++ b/activemq-broker/src/main/java/org/apache/activemq/broker/region/Queue.java\n@@ -580,7 +580,7 @@ public class Queue extends BaseDestination implements Task, UsageListener, Index\n                             }\n                         }\n                     }\n-                    if (!qmr.isDropped()) {\n+                    if (!qmr.isDropped() && !qmr.isAcked()) {\n                         redeliveredWaitingDispatch.addMessageLast(qmr);\n                     }\n                 }\n\n{code}\n\nTo reproduce this issue, I filled the disk completely by putting messages on a queue. I then used dd to zero out any remaining space on the disk. I then consumed the messages from the queue. /Some/ messages will be consumed but at some point the consumer will fail due to the out of space errors. Its at this point there will be some acked messages put on redeliveredWaitingDispatch queue. This can be confirmed by adding a conditional breakpoint at {{org.apache.activemq.broker.region.Queue:584}} where {{qmr.isAcked() == true}}.\n\nAlso see: AMQ-4052\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/customFieldOption/10042","value":"Patch Available","id":"10042"}],"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"9223372036854775807","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Acknowledged messages marked for redelivery stop new messages being consumed","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdoyle","name":"rdoyle","key":"rdoyle","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Doyle","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=rdoyle","name":"rdoyle","key":"rdoyle","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Ryan Doyle","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Ubuntu 12.04\n\njava version \"1.7.0_75\"\nJava(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.7.0_75-b13)\nJava HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 24.75-b04, mixed mode)","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-5927/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i2iwjz:"}}
