This problem does not exist in ActiveMQ 5.3.1.\n\nHere are the steps to repeating the problem:\n1.  Subscriber registers with topic\n2.  Bring subscriber offline\n3.  Publish n messages to topic\n4.  Restart ActiveMQ\n5.  Bring subscriber online\n\nThis issue occurs with out of the box ActiveMQ 5.5.0 and 5.5.1.  The only changes I made were to maxPageSize and adding the destination to the activemq.xml.\n\nI attached a unit that can be used to reproduce the problem.\n\nThe unit test is using the DefaultMessageListenerContainer for the subscriber.
