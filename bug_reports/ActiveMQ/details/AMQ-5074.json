The leading and trailing '/' in MQTT is significant. \n\nThe '/' character in MQTT paths and filters is mapped to '.' in ActiveMQ, which leads to names like '.TopicA' and 'TopicA.'. However, ActiveMQ ignores empty path levels, although, they are just as significant for ActiveMQ. Although these path names are not common in ActiveMQ, which maybe the reason why the issue hasn't been discovered until now. \n\nActiveMQ needs to treat empty levels as significant, and pattern match accordingly. This requires change to ActiveMQDestination.getDestinationPaths() and some code cleanup in DestinationMap related classes and Destination filtering classes. A patch is attached (along with unit tests) to address this issue.
