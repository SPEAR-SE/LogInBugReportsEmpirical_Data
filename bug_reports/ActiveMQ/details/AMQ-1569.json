My application is developed using Spring Dynamic Modules 1.0-rc2, ActiveMq 5.0.0 and Atomikos 3.2.2.\n\nSometimes (50% of the time) when I start my application, the bundle that declare the connection factories to the jms broker runs into deadlock.\n\nThis is the declaration of my connection factories:\n\n<bean id=\"activemq.connectionFactory\" class=\"com.trilliantnetworks.griffin.utils.CustomXAJMSConnectionFactory\">\n    <property name=\"brokerURL\" value=\" failover:(tcp://software2:61616,tcp://software1:61616)\" />\n  </bean>\n  \n  <!-- Configure the JMS connector; call init to register for recovery! -->\n  <bean id=\"atomikos.connectionFactory\"\n        class=\"com.atomikos.jms.TopicConnectionFactoryBean\" init-method=\"init\">\n    <property name=\"resourceName\" value=\" jms.connectionFactory\"/>\n    <property name=\"xaTopicConnectionFactory\" ref=\" activemq.connectionFactory \"/>\n  </bean>\n  \n  <bean id=\"listen.jms.spring.singleConnectionFactory\" class=\"org.springframework.jms.connection.SingleConnectionFactory\" destroy-method=\"destroy\">\n    <constructor-arg ref=\"atomikos.connectionFactory \"/>\n  </bean>\n\nLooking deeper in the code I found that the application block when init is called in com.atomikos.jms.TopicConnectionFactoryBean.\n\nThe init method calls the method isSameRM of org.apache.activemq.TransactionContext that eventually calls waitForBrokerInfo in org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQConnection. The method blocks on brokerInfoReceived.await(). So I tried to found why brokerInfoReceived.countDown() is never called...\n\nI found that this is because createTransportListener of org.apache.activemq.transport.failover.FailoverTransport is sometimes called before the member variable transportListener was set. createTransportListener is called by the Thread ActiveMQ Transport: tcp://software2/192.9.200.182:61616 while setTransportListener is called by the main Thread that initialize my bundle.\n\nI am unable to reproduce the issue with activeMQ 4.1.1 so I think that is issue has been introduced with version 5.0.0.\n\nAlso, when I use the connection URL \"tcp://software2:61616\" instead of \"failover:(tcp://software2:61616,tcp://software1:61616)\" my application always start correctly.\n","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"160139","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Dead
