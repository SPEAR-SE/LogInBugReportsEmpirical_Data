I created a durable subscriber that consumes messages published to the above topic on another machine. I am using broker to broker communication between the two machines.\nI start up the two programs on either machine and see the messages coming through to the subscriber. If I then pull the network cable to disconnect the network between the two machines, wait for a minute and then plug it back in, my subscriber doesn't receive the messages any more. I can see from the output that the publisher is still publishing them (Temporary topics, non-durable queues all continue to sync up in our production environment, it is only the durable topics that don't work after network reconnect)\n\nIf I were to tweak a setting on the publisher's broker (that was introduced only in 5.5.0), suppressDuplicateTopicSubscriptions=false, then the topics work correctly after network reconnect. But this may have other unintended consequences and I was hoping to get a better idea of:\n- is this a known issue ? if so, then are there any specific challenges that have caused it not to be fixed?\n- are other people out there using durable topics and subscribers without a failover option that have run into this problem? What have they done to work around?\n\nHere is how my subscriber and publisher are set up:\nTopic Publisher (Machine 1)\n        publisherConnection = connFactory.createConnection();\n        publisherConnection.setClientID( \"ProducerCliID\" );\n        publisherConnection.start();\n\n        session = publisherConnection.createSession( true, -1 );\n        Destination producerTopic = session.createTopic( TEST_TOPIC_NAME );\n        producer = session.createProducer( (Topic)producerTopic );\n....\n....\n....\n    // On a timer, keep sending this out every 5 seconds\n                 String text = \"HELLO \" + count++;\n                TextMessage msg = session.createTextMessage( text );\n                System.out.println( \"Sending TextMessage = \" + msg.getText() );\n                producer.send( msg );\n                session.commit();\n\nSubscriber ( Machine 2):\n        Connection clientConnection = connFactory.createConnection();\n        clientConnection.setClientID(\"cliID\");\n        clientConnection.start();\n        Session session = clientConnection.createSession( false, Session.AUTO_ACKNOWLEDGE );\n\n        Destination topic = session.createTopic( topicName );\n        MessageConsumer subscriber = session.createDurableSubscriber( (Topic)topic, \"subName\" );\n\n        TestMessageListener msgListener = new TestMessageListener( 1000 );\n        subscriber.setMessageListener( msgListener );\n.....\n.....\n         // TestMessageListener's onMessage method simply outputs the message:\n        public void onMessage(Message message)\n        {\n            if ( message instanceof TextMessage )\n            {\n                System.out.println( \"Message received = \" + ((TextMessage)message) );\n

the situation.\nUsing a proxy can throw the Inactivity Monitor (even if it's paused or closed), but it does not capture an abrupt stop of the broker or it's connections.\nWhile doing more tests in the lab, throwing a socket disconnect error (that means, unplugging the network cable) seems to, as [~noelady] expressed, leave the durable subscribers in a zombie state: they seem to exists and receive packages, but aren't able to dequeue anything.\nThis fails as of ActiveMQ 5.7, haven't tested yet on 5.8.\n\nIf there is any way to cause a socket disconnect error programmatically, it may give us a hint.\n\nI may note that, while using ActiveMQ the results are really bad, using fuse-09-16 seems to give better results.\n\nThanks!","updateAuthor":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=acalvo","name":"acalvo","key":"acalvo","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Andreas

I can confirm my results are as Andreas Calvo previously stated. The situation occurs when you pull the network plug (or do a reboot on the hosting operating system).

It uses a tcpfaulty://.. transport.\nsee: org.apache.activemq.usecases.MulticastDiscoveryOnFaultyNetworkTest\n\nMaybe you can use some variant of that to reproduce in a unit test.\nWhen the network cable is unpluged, there is a delay in getting socket feedback that depends on the tcp stack settings for timeouts and retries. So from a java app perspective, connections that are half closed can appear valid for some period. Whatever the case, the broker should be able to deal with it though, and once the tcp stack reports the real state of the network, things should come back to normal.
