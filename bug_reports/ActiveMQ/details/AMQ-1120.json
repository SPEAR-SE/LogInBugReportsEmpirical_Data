Typically, my client and broker would not be within the same VM, but this issue was encountered while executing my junit tests - not in a typical deployment environment.\n \nBasically, DemandForwardingBridgeSupport.startLocalBridge() hangs on remoteBrokerNameKnownLatch.await();\n \nIt looks like the broker name becomes known prior to the call to await. I think the response is coming in after the triggerLocalStartBridge thread is spawned and the synchronized block in\nDemandForwardingBridgeSupport.startRemoteBridge() is exited but before the await call in triggerLocalStartBridge.  \n \nLike I said, I've only run into this when running demand forwarding with client and broker in the same VM along with a high volume of messages sent immediately after the connection is established, which for me, is an artifact of junit testing.  \n \nI have a relatively small number of clients that should connect fairly infrequently, so I just put a bandaid of a 100ms wait into TcpTransportServer.run right before getAcceptListener().onAccept() which allows my tests to complete successfully and has no appreciable impact on the performance I care about but it's obviously not a valid fix for the race condition.","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[],"aggregatetimeestimate":null,"customfield_12312341":null,"customfield_12312220":null,"customfield_12312022":null,"customfield_12310041":null,"customfield_12310921":null,"customfield_12310920":"254955","customfield_12312823":null,"summary":"Race Condition can result in hang on remoteBrokerNameKnownLatch","creator":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chrish","name":"chrish","key":"chrish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Hofstaedter","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"subtasks":[],"customfield_12310291":null,"reporter":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=chrish","name":"chrish","key":"chrish","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?avatarId=10452","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&avatarId=10452","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&avatarId=10452","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&avatarId=10452"},"displayName":"Chris Hofstaedter","active":true,"timeZone":"Etc/UTC"},"customfield_12310290":null,"aggregateprogress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"customfield_12311024":null,"environment":"Windows XP, demand forwarding, failover == true","customfield_12313520":null,"customfield_12311020":null,"duedate":null,"customfield_12310250":null,"progress":{"progress":0,"total":0},"comment":{"comments":[],"maxResults":0,"total":0,"startAt":0},"votes":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/issue/AMQ-1120/votes","votes":0,"hasVoted":false},"worklog":{"startAt":0,"maxResults":20,"total":0,"worklogs":[]},"customfield_12311820":"0|i180xz:"}}
