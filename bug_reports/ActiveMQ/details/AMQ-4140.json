This is not a bug, but rather an improvement that would make users' life easier IMO (and at least, mine).\n\nIn the attachments, I have provided:\n- a multi-module build that would allow you to easily and systematically replicate the above two issues: maven-activemq-plugin-user-acceptance-test.zip\n- a \"fixed\" version of maven-activemq-plugin, based on trunk / 5.8-SNAPSHOT (as of 2012/10/28 06:34 BST): maven-activemq-plugin.zip\n- a patch, containing the equivalent fix, in case this format is preferred: maven-activemq-plugin.patch\n\nI hope this will help to have this resolved in a 5.7.1 or 5.8 version of the plugin very soon? :-)\n\nCheers,\n\nM.\n\nP.S. : In case you need committers, I would be happy to occasionally help.\n(I noticed the documentation for this plugin is rather outdated, so could help with that at least)","customfield_10010":null,"timetracking":{"originalEstimate":"1h","remainingEstimate":"1h","originalEstimateSeconds":3600,"remainingEstimateSeconds":3600},"customfield_12312026":null,"customfield_12312023":null,"customfield_12312024":null,"customfield_12312340":null,"attachment":[{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/attachment/12551453","id":"12551453","filename":"maven-activemq-plugin.patch","author":{"self":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/rest/api/2/user?username=mcarre","name":"mcarre","key":"mcarre","avatarUrls":{"48x48":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?ownerId=mcarre&avatarId=22772","24x24":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=small&ownerId=mcarre&avatarId=22772","16x16":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=xsmall&ownerId=mcarre&avatarId=22772","32x32":"https://issues.apache.org/jira/secure/useravatar?size=medium&ownerId=mcarre&avatarId=22772"},"displayName":"Marc
