An active consumer may have unconsumed messages which need to be rolled back in the message audit. currently this rollback is occurring at an indeterminate time w.r.t to future dispatch.\ngiven consumer 1 has unconsumed messages 0-10, consumer 2 11-20 etc.. all need to be rolled back prior to recovery of consumer 3 which may get any message in the range 0 - 20 delivered to it. Currently, rollbacks are done on the next delivery. \nAll audit rollbacks need to be complete before any new delivery occurs on a recovered connection.\n\nThe result of over eager duplicate suppression is missing messages as the duplicates are auto acked.\nSymptom: missing messages from a consumer perspective. With debug logging on {code}log4j.logger.org.apache.activemq.ActiveMQMessageConsumer=DEBUG{code} it is possible to catch the duplicate suppression. If your missing messages are in this set, you may have this problem.\n\nworkaround is to reduce the prefetch or even use a pull consumer, prefetch=0 such that unconsumed messages do not back up in the consumers dispatch queue pending receive() calls.
