        "description": "We're trying to use the Jetty continuations MessageListenerService as\nan endpoint for an AJAX app where people get near-realtime updates in\ntheir browser, where each end user subscribes to their own queue of\nnotifications.  (If the user were to leave and then come back, they'd\nget another, brand new queue (with a new, unique name - not sure if\nthis is relevant.)\n\nThe plumbing seems to be working pretty well and it's quite a flashy\nbit of work, but we're seeing strange behavior with the very first\nmessage placed on the queue just disappearing (the\nMessageListenerServlet shows it consumes them but they never come down\nthe pipe to the browser over HTTP - or maybe they're being sent to a\ndifferent client or something?).  Sometimes none of the subsequent\nmessages ever show up on the client, other times everything works as\nexpected.\n\nWe tried unsuccessfully to figure out the cause of the problem,\nbecause it's sporadic, but it seems to be at least somewhat related to\nhttp sessions (a cleanly wiped firefox will work great - but then\nrepeating the test in the same firefox usually doesn't work) and for\nwhatever reason safari seems to work OK whether its cache has been\ncleared or not.  Since there's a difference between web browsers the\nobvious implication is that something is messed up client-side but\nwe're having a real hard time figuring out what that could be - no JS\nexceptions or errors, etc, so we've tried messing with all kinds of\ncaching to no avail.  This is activemq 5.2.0.  I attached two files,\none is the debug output from a working session (with safari) and one\nfrom a non-working session with firefox - the events seem to all show\nup in the logs OK, but for whatever reason they don't make it to the\nbrowser.\n\n\n------\n\nA simple case to demonstrate, consisting of an html page\nwith JS that subscribes to a random queue, the _amq js file, and\nprototype.js.\n\nRefreshing the page (and therefore subscribing to a new random queue)\ndoes not seem to work in firefox, but does work in safari.  any ideas\nwhy that is?\n\nTo run the demo, unzip the attached zip file into the /demo directory\nof the activemq project, and then hit http://localhost:8161/demo/bug/\nin firefox/safari - add things to the queue from the activemq admin\nconsole.",
