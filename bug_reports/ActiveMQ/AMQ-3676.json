        "description": "Hi,\n\nAm seeing some strange behaviour with OptimizeAcknowledge, may well be something i've missed in terms of the configuration but would be good to get it clarified.\n\nOur use case is a topic with very fast flowing data, we want all consumers to get messages with a minimum of latency and would prefer that messages get conflated rather than building up a large queue and hence delays.\n\nWe therefore have the following configuration:\n - Low prefetch size (100)\n - Low ConstantPendingMessageLimitStrategy (100)\n - Conflation when the slow consumer handling kicks in (OldestMessageEvictionStrategy)\n\nWould like to optimise this further, following Gary's tips in AMQ-3607 I decided to re-enable OptimizeAcknowledge in the hopes that this would further improve latency.\n\nFollowing that was seeing that consumers receive a burst of messages, then become a slow consumer (i.e. prefetch is full) and fail to receive any further messages. Had an AbortSlowConsumerStrategy in place which was initially masking the problem as the reconnect caused messages to flow again. However removing this causes the consumers to receive a burst of messages then the flow stops indefinitely (whilst messages get discarded on the server as evidenced by the PendingQueueSize in JMX), so looks like nothing is getting acked. \n\nFrom the discussion on AMQ-3607 I understand that by default once 65% of the prefetch is full (or after a configurable period of time once Gary's patch from AMQ-3607 is available), a batch of acks should be sent.\n\nHave created a test case to reproduce this (attached):\n\n{code:title=testWithoutOptimiseAcknowledge}\nPublisher: Send 0\nFastConsumer: Receive 0\nPublisher: Send 50\nFastConsumer: Receive 50\nPublisher: Send 100\nFastConsumer: Receive 100\nPublisher: Send 150\nFastConsumer: Receive 150\ntestWithoutOptimiseAcknowledge: Sent: 200 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]\ntestWithoutOptimiseAcknowledge: Received: 200 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]\n{code}\n\n{code:title=testWithOptimiseAcknowledge}\nPublisher: Send 0\nFastConsumer: Receive 0\nPublisher: Send 50\nPublisher: Send 100\nPublisher: Send 150\ntestWithOptimiseAcknowledge: Sent: 200 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49, 50, 51, 52, 53, 54, 55, 56, 57, 58, 59, 60, 61, 62, 63, 64, 65, 66, 67, 68, 69, 70, 71, 72, 73, 74, 75, 76, 77, 78, 79, 80, 81, 82, 83, 84, 85, 86, 87, 88, 89, 90, 91, 92, 93, 94, 95, 96, 97, 98, 99, 100, 101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108, 109, 110, 111, 112, 113, 114, 115, 116, 117, 118, 119, 120, 121, 122, 123, 124, 125, 126, 127, 128, 129, 130, 131, 132, 133, 134, 135, 136, 137, 138, 139, 140, 141, 142, 143, 144, 145, 146, 147, 148, 149, 150, 151, 152, 153, 154, 155, 156, 157, 158, 159, 160, 161, 162, 163, 164, 165, 166, 167, 168, 169, 170, 171, 172, 173, 174, 175, 176, 177, 178, 179, 180, 181, 182, 183, 184, 185, 186, 187, 188, 189, 190, 191, 192, 193, 194, 195, 196, 197, 198, 199]\ntestWithOptimiseAcknowledge: Received: 50 [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31, 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44, 45, 46, 47, 48, 49]\n\njava.lang.AssertionError: \nExpected :200\nActual   :50\n{code}\n\nCheers,\nJames",
