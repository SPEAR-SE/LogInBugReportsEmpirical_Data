        "description": "I'm running activemq 5.9.0 with levelDB storage. Before, all my applications were running fine. It means all messages in activemq are processed in time. Activemq worked also fine with that. But recently, one of the application stopped to process messages due to system problem. So the messages are piled in activemq queue. That was fine and as expected. \n\nBut one day, I found all the consumers can not consume messages from activemq. I checked the queue depth in web console and found that, the enqueued counter is increasing but the dequequed counter stops for all queues. If I click the queue name trying to browse the queue, I found there was no message in it. Though the number of pending messages shows there are many messages in it. And I'm sure there are actually messages in it because my application consuming from one of the queues are broken.\n\nI checked my levelDB storage and it's about 40G. I had no idea what happened so I tried to restart activemq. But after the restart I found all the messages are lost. I checked the levelDB data and the old data files are still there(40G). \n\nThe new messages processing were fine right after the restart. But after several hours, the same issue happened again. All consumers stopped consuming any messages. I restarted activemq again the found the recently piled messages were lost too.",
